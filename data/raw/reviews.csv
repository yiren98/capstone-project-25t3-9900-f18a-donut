Things just got done (initially) - relatively streamlined bureaucracy compared with other organisations I've worked for. Excellent travel and re-location opportunities, but you really have to work hard to chase them and build your internal network - which I did, but that's hard for some people.

Singapore,2025-06,Work life balance unequal dependent on team and stakeholders
American,2025-06,Suffers from bureaucracy more than most - bloated and too decision makers (or perceived ones) at the table. A lack of commitment to want to change or consider alternative approaches. ExCo say the right things but the message and outcomes dissolve by the time it gets delivered by upper/middle management - leaving you disappointed
Australia,2025-05,Company structure is not standard for all sites
Canada,2025-06,"progression, toxic leadership and promoted"
Australia,2025-06,"Toxic work culture, management by intimidation, sexist policies, racism prevalent. Bad organisation and data management."

American,2025-03,Don’t really have any I enjoyed my time here
Canada,2025-04,Pay Office location Back to work
American,2025-04,- Technical culture is poor and not what it used to be from the 1990s like I was led to believe - Teams are often understaffed in the geology space and you will be required to work across a few different functions - Training and upskilling is dependent on bosses to prioritise and the quality of said training is highly variable.
American,2025-03,Career progression difficult depending on position.
Australia,2025-03,Not being able to work with the people that we are working for. Administration stuck in a separate building away from the crews. The feeling of disconnection was apparent for most of us.

Australia,2025-01,"Lack of support and resources Colleagues on higher wages although performing same role, when bought up wasnt even actioned. Diversity at all cost = resulting in others suitably qualified being overlooked to ""tick a box"" with people who have no clue or experience in-role. Politics and nepotism rife Suppose to present as a Leader"" but treated as previous entry level position. Pay rate lower than competitors."
Australia,2025-01,There is no cons working here
Canada,2025-01,The workload can be challenging
Singapore,2025-01,too many changes in a short time.
Canada,2025-01,Huge organization leads to some beuraucracy
American,2025-01,None that come to mind
Australia,2025-01,"Meetings on meetings on meetings. So much time spent of making sure everyone feels good rather than cracking on and getting work done. Nonsense bonus system which employee has little to no influence on, which. Constant reminder of how all employees (male) are bad and we all need to ""do better"". Gender targets take precedence over skills and dedication to a ones career - leaders/managers have to make an extremely strong case to put a male into any promotion situation, makes a complete mockery of the requirement to do a development plan."
Canada,2025-01,The management was not very organized
Singapore,2025-01,Pretty low salary. They dont pay support roles well. Some colleagues will get competitive and will do their best to get ahead. Management dont really listen like all other MNCs.

American,2024-11,Boring not much to do except watch movies
Australia,2024-11,- Some sites have more red tape than others - Long hours on site - Workplace politics at times
American,2024-10,so far good i would highly recommend
Singapore,2024-11,Politics takes precedence over everything else including performance. Management can be brutal when it comes to firing (not the most humane way of letting someone go). How happy you are depends on who your team lead is. Senior management is aloof and seems to be out of touch with the ground.
Australia,2024-10,Rio Tinto can hire some muppets
Canada,2024-10,Difficult to move up and often external candidates are hired in management levels
United Kingdom,2024-10,Expected to work around the clock because of many time zones

American,2024-10,Poor growth opportunity(depends a lot on manager)
Singapore,2024-10,Rio Tinto usually provides a good work environment. Do not see any major cons
American,2024-09,"Leadership is basically in Brisbane having gottten rid of any people centric leaders in Perth directs Perth office and the bad leaders mimic the leadership style , too much focus on managing up and also Diversity targets ...I'd avoid and work for another miner TBH"
Singapore,2024-10,"lots of politics too many ""groups"" in the top management"
Canada,2024-09,Big company with long process but we'll structured
Australia,2024-10,"Slow to implement changes generally, though this have turned around in recent times."
Australia,2024-09,No support from management. Didn’t receive the proper training
Singapore,2024-09,Dependent on team Promotion opportunities not easy
American,2024-09,Diversity strategy is heavily weighted
American,2024-10,"It was a great place to learn and develop, now you will only be blamed for the shortcomings of leaders who pretend to care, place unrealistic expectations and expect you to be happy when they push all the blame on to you while claiming credit for your hard work. They claim to want to know the issues with systems and processes then quickly make you out to be the scape goat for everything that happens after you’ve warned them of the existing failures."
American,2024-09,Leadership do t really care
American,2024-09,Hard to make changes- lots of overhead as it’s such a big company
Australia,2024-09,Subject to commodity cycle and associated workforce adjustments
Canada,2024-09,Month end deadlines resulting OT
Canada,2024-09,"Great set of values : Courage, Care, Curiosity but not living up to them. Government like bureaucracy. Risk-averse management, stand-stillnessis gets you promotion."
American,2024-09,Not as secure as some other industries/companies
American,2024-09,Politics could be complex. Move across areas / grow - not easy. Things move slow at a times/
American,2024-09,"f you work in Rail Engineering and Strategy, Save yourself the time and heart ache - don't work here. The leader of Intergrated Systems is more interested in justifying their own role within the business than they are stamping out the toxic culture that exists (largely due to their inability to lead and address issues as they are raised as opposed to sweeping them under the rug) in purple circle culture. While some departments in the business are well managed like Train Control others are toxic - it's well known and nothing is done about it, Turnover in the department I worked in was through the roof due to poor management - unrealistic expectations of staff and no signs of the toxic micromanagement bullying culture changing any time soon."
American,2024-09,Global hours can be challenging for those in global roles.
Canada,2024-09,Fewer option to grow inside
American,2024-09,"Camp conditions could be improved, but partially this is outside the control. Retention of the experience in the workforce could also be improved."

Canada,2024-08,"not that much work opportunities for those who want to progress, vertical or lateral."
American,2024-08,"Nothing rally, i love working here"
American,2024-08,Too many chiefs due to the size of the organisation. Culture of fear makes decision making slow and cumbersome. People in lower management positions are vocal about being “busy” but not producing very much. Difficult to effect change for this reason.
American,2024-08,Shift work and the long hours
Australia,2024-08,Purple circle might exist and prevail
Australia,2024-08,"No Cons, great place to work"
Singapore,2024-08,Only if management of business unit believes in what the company preaches
American,2024-08,Career development is low and can feel like a number
Singapore,2024-07,Conservative management and work in silos
Australia,2024-08,Can be large and unweilding trying to make changes
Canada,2024-07,Company is too big so sometimes diffiuclt to find the excat person you are looking for
Australia,2024-07,Slightly below benchmark for wages. Camp food under par.
Canada,2024-07,- not a tech company - not a competitive salary compare to tech companies
American,2024-07,You are treated like a child and chain to your desk like a slave. Too bad if you need to use the rest rooms hope you brought a nappy. You are also trapped now as a controller forever.
American,2024-07,"Where to start. It's a toxic place to work, where the incentive scheme is designed to pit co-workers against each other. 25% of the work force MUST lose 25% of their bonus each year, it's mandated. So in a small team people literally set each other up to avoid being in the bottom 25%. Constant restructures, you never know who or what is going to happen. All people can do is suck up to whoever they think will protect their job. It's also a DEI workplace, they're gone full potato on it. There's just no hope if you aren't a minority of some kind. All of this of course is why they've ended up as one of the worst performing miners, unable to manage costs or deliver projects.

There is a strong preference to outsource/partner to manage risk and liability rather than to build and assemble winning teams using internal resources. Its a large company, so there is lots of governance and process which can feel like its difficult to get things done. There is some degree of re-organisation that occurs every 18-24 mths due to leadership changes/transformation work. Internal resources are often overloaded and diversity (gender and ethnicity) remains a challenge (not just a divisional issue, it's an industry issue)."
Singapore,2022-05,Sometimes I feel like I don't get pushed to my limits
Singapore,2022-05,very silo-ed no opportunity for growth
Australia,2022-05,"Unbelievably toxic culture, team leaders/supers/mgmt hired on who they're friends with in management, instead of competence. This leaves competent people who want to do a good job stuck doing the job, unable to change anything while incompetent people run the place. More and more and more work was offshored to India, but we were told we were still responsible for keeping things operational. We couldn't even build servers or purchase licenses, everything had to be a ticket or required change management. Ultimately, we were 100% responsible for network/compute operations but couldn't get the permissions or ability to even do the work required to run the place. Biggest disappointment was discovering at the last minute that some full time employees were all going to be replaced with contractors. Except, they didn't tell us that, they just went and did it. Only a matter of time until they outsourced our positions to India and replaced us. If only they had the decency to tell us. Also, no training or career progression of any kind. I was investigated by Ethics and Integrity for trying to book tickets to Cisco Live. Insane. Pay was poor considering you were on an industrial site doing a job they couldn't get people to do."

Australia,2021-12,It is a remarkably un-diverse workplace by amost any measure. Most of the people making decisions have never worked anywhere else.

Singapore,2021-11,Too bureaucratic and risk averse
American,2021-11,Two sets of rules exist between the main workforce and senior leaders. Very little accountability for poor decisions made by leaders. Many fail to uphold the company values. Constant re-structures add to the disorganisation and the answer is to simply throw money at the problems instead of addressing them at the root cause.
American,2021-10,"Toxic culture Insecure, incompetent people who brown nose are the ones promoted. Experience is seen as a threat and huge turnover of people doing the grunt work. No strategy and 100% focus on costs. Hot desks are horrible. If people want to work from home and have proven themselves productive, management should let them work where they want. Their new Everyday Respect Task Force is nothing but a joke and something corporate can pitch to the media to say they are working on their internal issues. Sent an email to their generic email address, only to receive a boilerplate response several days later, and stating they would reach out to immediate manager. So much for confidential and anonymous. Their reputation is still hurting from their big cave blowup in 2020 and still no signs of recovering. Lot of internal politics with promotions given to mates rather than competent people. Silos culture and a lot of bullying attitudes. Managers are more caught up with ensuring they have people reporting to them in the org chart rather than career development of their staff. Lowball offers for contract to permanent roles"

Singapore,2021-10,"Toxic work culture. Very hard to get anything done as everyone is resistant to change. Even if the change is an obviously good idea it will get stalled for months then quietly pulled. Perception prevails over reality. By this I mean the loud shouty career politician types who tell everyone how good they are, are seen as much better than the people who are good at doing the actual work. There is also a ""woke"" agenda in the workplace that is being heavily pushed by HR so that hiring candidates has nothing to do with actual skill anymore. All the VPs run their divisions like feudal warlords. Internal promotions across business units are almost impossible to get as the managers prefer to just hire their mates. It is very much not a meritocracy."

United Kingdom,2021-09,Poor conditions overall but ok
American,2021-09,Resistance to change Archaic processes/software Clueless management who bring in awful processes to try to 'fix' major structural issues with how departments are run without actually listening to the people in the teams who know what they're doing Below market pay No value placed on training upcoming engineers 'properly'.

Canada,2020-12,Many business units across the globe but little opportunity for international mobility. Poor talent and expertise management structure.
Singapore,2020-12,"Everything ... seriously, it is the most depressing and dysfunctional workplaces I've ever encountered. One walk around the offices shows moroseness, heads down, scared looking, and staring blankly ahead. Nobody says greetings like ""good morning"" or ""hello."" It is horrible. Read the other reviews on Glassdoor. In order of worst Cons: 1. Seems to be that employees are the ""enemy"" and they are frequently undermined. No pun intended. 2. Salary - Initially, salary seemed pretty good, but company has a habit of unilaterally cutting base salaries and benefits whenever possible, sometimes up to 30% or more. This can be a blanket ""removal of allowances"" or a restructure of the bonus calculation - all with the aim of reducing salaries paid to employees. Similarly, almost any time a role is refilled, the ""banding"" or salary range will be downgraded so that the incoming replacement is shorted some compensation. Similarly, roles often get combined or off-shored so have to do more for less 3. It is an ""old boys network"" in the classic sense. In order to keep this lucrative musical chairs going lower downs may be undercut and outsiders never brought in. 4. Backstabbing - Setting up for failure or simply not supporting are common practice in my experience, it is the accepted way of work here. It is remarkable that anything actually gets done (not much does) due to the constant plotting and restructuring and empire-building that goes on. 5. Ego - Rio Tinto thinks of itself as the greatest company in the world: ""We aren't a mining company, we are a tech company ""... Well, certainly suppliers and customers laugh at that. The company doesn't want fresh or innovative ideas despite paying lip-service to this. 6. Diversity and Inclusion - Or, lack of. 7. No training or development budgets. This was always hidden from employers and only recently was essentially taken away. Training or development must come from departmental budgets and hence ... not supported. 7. Double-speak: Rio are masters of ""saying one thing, yet doing another."" One has to read between the lines for almost all internal communications to understand the real meaning or intent. Up is down, black is white and night is day in the Rio Tinto world. For example, the recent revision of the bonus calculation method was ""not a cost reduction exercise"" but rather a ""positive revision to make the system simpler."" Oh, but the fact that many will get lower bonuses well, that is just a coincidence. [Sarcasm intended.]"

Singapore,2019-07,Politics can be out of control at times
Australia,2019-06,"still some silos in the organisation, but we do have a good senior management team who are looking to challenge the stereotype of a global mining organisation"
American,2019-07,Have to travel a lot more.
American,2019-06,There are none at the moment
Australia,2019-06,No flexibility on remuneration and no allowances provided when working away
Singapore,2019-06,"culture in Singapore is very non-inclusive. if you are a white male from australia you will be fine, but if not you will enjoy a misogynistic nepotistic culture and a perception held by most white males in the company that they are being overlooked for undeserving diverse talent (even though there are no Singaporean’s in senior roles in Singapore and women are few ) A lot of talk about inclusion but who gets promoted and rewarded is bullies and/or people who are just good at self-promoting on yammer/power point. there is lots of bullying actually and people who undermine other colleagues to get ahead, especially in Singapore...not an enjoyable place to work exco is I think well-meaning but need to improve the culture"
Singapore,2019-04,"-Too shareholder centric which is understandable given they are listed across multiple stock exchanges. Despite having the best performance in over 140 years of operation, the bonus was a measly 2 months. -Tall hierarchy. Too much politics at all."
United Kingdom,2019-05,management and policy changes were badly communicated
American,2019-04,None has been good career.
Singapore,2019-03,Avoid at all cost now
United Kingdom,2019-03,Small footprint in London and decreasing
South Africa,2019-01,Largely divested from Africa and downsized
American,2018-11,"Management not great, very limited chance of getting a promotion."
Singapore,2019-01,"Lack of Consistency from Leadership , Constant Changes before Strategy is implemented, Too Short term view, Internal politics"
American,2018-11,Career growth opportunities are limited Workspace lacks modern outlook
American,2018-11,Rio Tinto needs to find the focus and discipline to drive advancements home with proper process.
Australia,2019-01,The organisation has changed so many senior people that no one knows who does what any more. The new team don’t know the business basics Are yet so everything is highly politicized. The new operational hubs are a long way from operations and the top down centralisation can kill local initiatives.
American,2018-11,"Work life balance, not enough time with family"
Canada,2018-09,It depends on everyone's experience.
Australia,2018-09,"Exceptionally poor systems and processes, which frustrate employees and leaders. Business claims it’s fantastic, but systems like AskHR are disgusting. They are slow, response is poor, result is often not what you request. The application of any common sense in relation to what you request is non exiting. Fellow leaders would literally slump in their chair when they knew that they had to use these systems to help their employees."
Canada,2018-09,Great Job uncertainty major company wide layoffs every 6 months
Australia,2018-10,"Absolutely farce of a performance appraisal process, it would be easier and more cost efficient to just give pay rises where deserved, you gotta be in the boys club. Real talent generally gets unoticed (on purpose) and walks out the door a year later. Lots of acting opportunity if you like doing higher duties and responsibilities for no extra pay this is your company. Very reactive to incidents and safety. No transparency whatsoever."
Australia,2018-11,There’s a few cliques in coal and iron ore BUs The transformation of shared services the last 4 years has not delivered its intended outcomes and would have cost a fortune that I now understand had been partially reverted.
United Kingdom,2018-09,"Work landscape constantly changing, middle management overload"
Australia,2018-09,current reshape of the business
American,2018-08,Could not ask any better workplace
American,2018-09,Bureaucracy that comes hand in hand when working as part of a larger company
Singapore,2018-08,"Very political, good performance doesn’t get you ahead. Currying up does."
American,2018-08,You have to know someone to get ahead. Poor leadership up through senior leaders that don't have ground experience. Poor leaders are not dealt with.
Singapore,2018-08,You will used up all the health benefit. Cos the manager are crazy people. Force you come early and don't let you off until 6.30pm. And kept giving threat to staff by saying will sack them. The higher management knew your mistake and had agreed to threaten you.
American,2018-09,Dynamic scheduling is run like a private kingdom Zero transparency Direct appoint people to roles with no advertising the position or giving other candidates even a chance of applying. Secondments almost always given to people outside the team. Demoralising for schedulers who realise they will have no scope of growth. Leadership team utilise nepotism as means to get mates jobs. Manager busy scoring brownie points direct appointing people to roles. Direct appointing people based on gender and nepotism. Zero value for skills experience or knowledge. Rio values of transparency equal opportunity etc is non existant in dynamic scheduling as a department.
Singapore,2018-07,Depend on which BU you works in. Some are really bad because of too rigid rulings
Singapore,2018-07,"Structural changes, ongoing job cuts"
American,2018-07,Functional or technical review (restructure) happens far too often and affect morale. Decision to work in an agile working environment reduced productivity and made me feel like i am just a resource and not valued. HR does not acknowledge and provide closure for applicants. This is embarrassing especially when we refer good candidates to HR and they leave them hanging. why bother?
Canada,2018-04,Heavy focused on staff reduction and outsourcing in IT Constant reorganization and change in the structure Very difficult and stressful for people who don't do well with job insecurity due to the constant restructuring
Australia,2018-04,Uniquely administrate multimedia based e-markets with functional opportunities. Holisticly customize exceptional outsourcing without standardized benefits. Conveniently syndicate granular architectures before future-proof ideas. Compellingly leverage existing fully researched value.
Canada,2018-05,"As everything changes so often with any reason, nobody is accountable for nothing, creating inefficient processes. Lot of uncertainty lead by a small elite very unproductive and boot licking."
Canada,2018-03,Challenging and can disrupt work life balance
Australia,2018-04,"Ultimately it comes down to this. During my 7 year career with Rio I was not given the opportunity to advance my skills in geology to move either into another geology role (without going back to graduate roles) or move up in the system (boom over positions consolidated old wood not trimmed). You won't be given opportunity to model deposits, you won't be given opportunity to move into other siloed departments, you probably won't get overseas (although I did...) and unless you happen to get lucky the role will be a dead end."
American,2018-04,"Demands on time, travel can be excessive"
Canada,2018-03,"Development path, structural changes often"
Australia,2018-03,Remote Areas can be difficult for work life balance
American,2018-02,Manager can't help to grow the team
American,2018-03,The company is huge to keep collaborate with all stakeholders.
United Kingdom,2018-02,Huge change program underway creating uncertainty and low loyalty (both ways)
Australia,2018-03,"Working away, Monotonous, 2/1 Roster"
Singapore,2018-02,"1. Lack of cohesion between Executive leadership 2. With the creation of the new Commercial organisation, everyone has worked well to have their cronies into MD & GM positions 3. Lot of senior leaders are out of touch with reality and only interested in looking after themselves and their rat pack 4. Talent & hard work means nothing, it’s all about who you know and suck up to 5. Big news about diversity, where’s the local talent development. instead bring expat females (only ONE Singaporean GM out of almost 35, not a single Ecco member other than people from Australia, EU & North America) 6. Scale is heavily tilted towards Project Managers and handful of people who actually do work 7. A culture of meeting and hand balling with no accountability 8. Serious lack of integrity, credibility and honestly, people are pawn they use in their self preserving games"
Singapore,2018-02,"Changes are inevitable but it can be better communicated. A mammoth organization and folks often work in silos and work responsibilities are finely demarcated, sometimes inadvertently creating a culture where people don't go beyond what is common sense."
Singapore,2018-02,Too much hierarchy and politics.
Singapore,2018-02,Company very much guided by short term sharehoder return Mindset is still very industrial and mine / production focused
American,2018-01,"Pace of change can be scary at times, but makes it exciting and challenging. The global nature is a positive but can make connecting more difficult"
Singapore,2018-01,"Like most big organisations, there are a lot of bureucracies and red tapes, which slows down a lot of approval process and limits introduction of new initiatives/projects."
Singapore,2018-01,"Constant changes to structure and jobs, leading to uncertainty and difficulty (temporarily) in adapting and performing within current roles."
American,2018-01,Business and profit driven. Some unfairness
Canada,2017-12,It's a nice company. There are a lot of advantages however the date of starting is a little fix. It cold be better.
Canada,2018-01,"- Long hours of work, no worklife - balance consideration - Uncertainty and instability, too numerous changes in the direction where the company is going in the last 3 years. This company is not for “cardiac” people or they will not stay long - Lack of recognition. Lack of feedback in regards to our work. - As HSE being a priority, should focus more on wellness and wellbeing and mental wellness - - Loyalty. We can be long term employee or not, we are just ""a number"" that they can remove quickly. The company is not showing us the contrary unfortunately."
American,2017-12,"Sometimes shortsighted planning regarding staff numbers. Still maintain coal assets. Very male dominated company, could do more in this space."
Canada,2017-10,"Great level of stress, constant job uncertainty"
Australia,2017-11,None that i can think of
Australia,2017-11,Management can sometimes be unproffessional or even cowboyish. Most are very respectable but there are a few that let the team down but as they have good technical and working knowledge they are generally left to there own devices to acheive the desired results.
Australia,2017-09,"Fifo, camp life. Every aspect of the job has been squeezed corners cut and productivity over safety. A strong push for the appearance of a safety culture. Everything is subject to change for company requirements"
Australia,2017-08,Very demanding environment with constant change. It requires high emotional resilience. Workloads can be high as the tend to have many initiatives on the go all the time
Singapore,2017-08,Overly consultative and too consensus driven at times which can stall progress and decision making. Working across global timezones can be challenging/exhausting.
United Kingdom,2017-07,Heavily male dominated and a real feeling it would be more difficult to climb as a woman.
American,2017-05,Bullied small companies. Care about money and profit over employees and safety. Once were good but squeezed and squeezed employees until most now hate the company and show up just to be paid.
American,2017-05,"No prospects of growth, Stagnation."
Australia,2017-04,Work-life balance with the 8 days on 6 days off roster. Staying longer duration on site can start getting to your nerves after a while.
United Kingdom,2017-05,"People are instiutionalised, due to redundancies people were miserable so made for a difficult work environment, easy to get siloed and things took forever to get done."
Canada,2017-04,You are just a number unless you have an exeptional manager or a mentor within the company. Creer development is zero
Australia,2017-03,No career path for contractors
American,2017-04,No career advancement unless you are female or from an indigenous background
American,2017-03,"Not the fault of the company, but the economic climate is leading to a wave of outsourcing and downsizing in the mining sector. Inevitably the larger companies are less agile in making decisions."
Canada,2017-02,"Long hours, living away from home and family."
American,2017-02,"Too many incompetent people and flatterers, only interest to climb their way up and nth else. Don't have a strong sense of career achievement if stay there for too long. Higher management team is pretty mean."
American,2017-02,constant org structure changes crippling the business.
Canada,2017-01,"Fatigue Culture, lack of transparency from leader, transformation cut to deep and has left the morale and confidence for the future fractured"
United Kingdom,2017-01,No cons to employment at Rio Tinto which is interested in Win-Win situations for all stakeholders including market competitive rates for employees and contractors.
American,2017-01,"Less focus on career development for professionals, rigid systems (No flexible working options)"
Australia,2016-12,I don't find any cons for Rio
United Kingdom,2016-12,Cost cutting has led to low morale; nepotism in some parts of head office with executive assistants and other youngsters who have not been promoted on merit; sometimes a reluctance to challenge senior executives or managers.
Australia,2016-12,"- you are just a number - completely sexist still, boys club in senior positions, they will have social drinks just with boys invited and won't invite any women, there is a negative light and negative comments are made about women that only work 3 or 4 days a week as they have young kids at home or have just had a baby - what makes it more annoying is that the company constantly talks about ""diversity & inclusion"" when it clearly the least diverse and least inclusive company around - people will outwardly lie to make you look bad so that they can try look better"
American,2016-11,Stagnancy owing to global downturn in the commodities market.
United Kingdom,2016-11,"The pay is not that great. Although the friendly atmosphere makes up for it because it does not even feel like work, it feels like getting to spend time with friends."
United Kingdom,2016-11,Systems are appalling taking twice as long to get anything done. People work in silos. More and more is being squeezed out of employees with little or no reward. Company culture is non-existent. They certainly would be found on any 'Best Company to Work For' listing.
United Kingdom,2016-11,Poisonous culture fostered by political gaming The world under Sam was pretty tough but it was performance based. Under J-S it is malevolent and deeply political
Singapore,2016-08,Lack of adequate development opportunities. Alot of focus on 'serving time' in junior positions. The hierarchy within procurement function is too steep. Lack of decision making power at junior levels does not come as a surprise given it's a multinational company. High impetus on a 'serious' than a 'sincere' work culture.
Australia,2016-10,"Very limited career advancement. Unless you get a sponsor, you have no chance"
Australia,2016-08,none that i can remember
United Kingdom,2016-08,Can be difficult to navigate a large company - build networks locally and internationally - this will help hugely.
Australia,2016-09,2013-2014 was a tough time for the resource industry
American,2016-08,Significant amount of administrative requirements
Canada,2016-09,Spinning off value added industries could lead to being very vulnerable to volatile metal maker prices in a global economy.
Australia,2016-09,no carrier progression or HR services No sick leaves or bonuses
Australia,2016-10,Appears that there is minimum development for long term employees. Business future seems unstable making it worrying about the future.
Singapore,2016-09,"hierachy, process, communication, divisions, manual"
American,2016-08,"Did not foster movement for mining engineers throughout the business. Not a lot of support through graduate program. Got the feeling that if you got good at something, you were ""pigeon-holed"" and stuck doing that one thing."
United Kingdom,2016-08,"Under resourced for output expectation, very political and lacks unity. Not such a supportive environment lately, imbalance in workloads, needs fluid resource allocation"
American,2016-08,"The ability to play office politics is now a required skill at Rio Tinto. Most senior leaders survive because they say yes to their leaders. If you work hard and commit to the company it will count for nothing when the cutbacks occur. If you have an issue you have to ring a call centre in Manilla and listen to some one read a script to you, with an American accent."
American,2016-07,"The uncertainty that started at the end of the boom with rolling redundancies and restructures every few months was frustrating and made following projects through to the end almost impossible. Those with great mentors within the company were able to be promoted with ease, whilst others were left to flounder. Very safety and health conscious during the boom times however it rapidly went downhill afterwards as they continually cut health and safety teams and training."
United Kingdom,2016-06,Big corporate company; a lot of waste. Also could do with more training opportunities to help graduates develop better.
Canada,2016-06,"Too much instability Culture of outsourcing everything in India, Poland etc... Management treats pleople like commodities, no human aspects, consideration for your career aspirations, just blatant favouritism everywhere. They always ask for more and more and they give you less and less. It is simply not a place to work for except for money. Very negative place."
American,2016-05,"Standard big company stuff. Lots of processes, lack of efficiency, politics, silo effects of different business units competing against each other for outcomes/budgets etc. The interesting engineering work was outsourced to EPCMs so internal engineers did not get to work on them. ""Senior"" engineers were not actually that senior in terms of their technical experience but just years in the workforce so not a great environment for a junior engineer wanting to learn the ropes."
Australia,2016-05,"Staff cuts went far too far in the Final Solution (where all the 'thinkers' were let go), and most of the organisation's intellectual property destroyed for good. If you're a 'yes' man or woman right now, you'll do well. No longer a leader but a follower. Company has lost the ability to be a free-thinker, back to its Leigh Clifford-era conservatism. Once keen to push the envelope now wants to do the bare minimum. HR departments very poor. Several experiences of great internationally-renowned talent wanting to join the Group but HR incompetence saw them get cold feet. Salary benchmarking non-existent. Talent management program essentially a front for senior management to move their 'favourites' up the ladder quicker (saw evidence of managers rigging scores to keep the 'doers in the basement' as such doing their work for them). I loved my time at Rio Tinto, but looking back am very glad I left when I did. It's a completely different organisation now (I meet up regularly with current employees). I would still just recommend them, as riding the next wave could be exciting.....if you can wait that long."
Australia,2016-05,"Persistent long hours, doing more with less, Now Now Now attitude from superintendants"
Singapore,2016-04,"Risk-adverse environment : you have to prove your worth on the same job for 3+ years to be given a shot at a more challenging task/project The good/skilled ones leave, the bad ones stay Ethnic bias in promotion to upper management Gender bias in promotion to middle management (women over men) Dull tasks made even duller by uninspiring management No travel budget Very political environment Weekly meeting are always the occasion to have a good laugh between employees : General Managers show how out of touch with reality they are, everyone talks about his project when clearly no one else knows what they are talking about, apathy is all around"
Canada,2016-05,Lack of accountability leads to longer periods to get approvals completed.
American,2016-04,"Was initially offered graduate role, but due to budget cuts, many of the graduate positions were scrapped."
American,2016-05,"Not their fault, economic slow down didn't allow for Grad Program employment. A lot of people laid off."
