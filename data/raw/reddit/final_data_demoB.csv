None,Major Tasmania aluminium smelter delivers 'unsettling news' to staff,Sandy Powell,2582,394,"The Tasmanian government is seeking federal intervention for one of the state's major industrials after negotiations for a new power deal stalled, jeopardising its future.

Rio Tinto-owned Bell Bay Aluminium (BBA) has been in discussions with Hydro Tasmania for a new power deal in recent months as its current 10-year agreement expires on December 31.

The plant near George Town in northern Tasmania employs more than 500 people.

The company told staff the fact no agreement had been reached in the past 18 months was a ""significant risk"" given the looming deadline. Tasmanian energy minister Nick Duigan said there was a ""gap"" between what Hydro Tasmania could offer and a price that made BBA commercially viable, and called on the federal government for support.

A spokesperson for Tim Ayres, the federal minister for industry, said it was up to the state government to put together a deal.

Companies 'unable to reach suitable terms'
In the letter to staff seen by the ABC, general manager Richard Curtis said negotiations with Hydro Tasmania and the state and federal governments were continuing ""with utmost urgency"".

""We have been in negotiations with Hydro Tasmania to secure a new power agreement to extend the life of Bell Bay Aluminium operations to 2035,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, and despite extensive negotiations over the past 18 months, we have not yet been able to reach suitable terms.

""We understand that this news may be unsettling, and we want to acknowledge the impact it may have.""
Mr Duigan said he believed the government and Hydro Tasmania had done all they could to reach an agreement.

""I want Hydro to aggressively chase these opportunities and deliver the best price it possibly can to BBA,"" he said.

""The offer that is on the table is at or very close to the cost of production for energy.""

State seeks funding under federal scheme
Mr Duigan said BBA used about one third of the energy generated in Tasmania and helped stabilise the state's energy system.

He also said the smelter was among the greenest in the country and called on the federal government to offer support via its Green Aluminium Production Credit (GAPC) scheme.

""I am calling on the Commonwealth government … to show the interest they have clearly shown in other jurisdictions,"" he said.

On Wednesday, a $600 million support package was announced for a copper smelter in the Queensland town of Mount Isa. In August, the metals smelter Nyrstar, which has operations in Tasmania and South Australia, received a $135 million support package.

A spokesperson for Mr Ayres said it was up to the Tasmanian government to help Hydro and BBA reach a deal.

""This is concerning for the Bell Bay Aluminium workers, who would be affected by the potential decision to put the facility into care and administration by the end of this calendar year, as a result of the failure of the Tasmanian government to reach an agreement,"" they said.

""Bell Bay Aluminium has always operated in Tasmania because of reliable, low-cost, zero-emissions, clean electricity from hydro. 

""It really is up to the state government to put together a deal.""
They said the GAPC was still under design, and consultation would open in coming weeks.

""We look forward to receiving input from all stakeholders,"" the spokesperson said.

Struggle highlights industries' importance to state economy
BBA's trouble is just the latest in a long line of woes for the state's major industrials this year. As well as Nyrstar's issues, BBA's neighbouring manganese smelter Liberty Bell Bay struggled to secure ore shipments in May and was given $20 million by the state government.

And the Boyer Paper Mill — the country's last — also sought government support earlier in the year as it attempted to transition away from fossil fuel energy.

Ray Mostogl, chief executive of the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council said the failure of BBA and Hydro to reach a new deal was a ""red flag"".

He said plants like Bell Bay Aluminium, one of the state's four major industrial sites, consumed so much power it offset prices for Tasmanian households and businesses.

""The Tasmanian community may be oblivious of how this could impact their cost of living pressures,""  he said.
""With all four major industrials experiencing business continuity issues, albeit due to a range of different issues, electricity pricing appears to be one source of cost pressure for all four.

""It begs the question why and what can be done, and importantly, what it could mean to Tasmanians if one of the [major industrials] closed."" Loss of industrial site 'devastating' for Tasmania
The state's shadow energy minister, Janie Finlay, said the state government's ""inaction is inexcusable"".

""They've known for years that this power contract needed to be negotiated, yet they have done nothing,""  Ms Finlay said.
She said if a deal with BBA was unable to be reached, it could be ""catastrophic"" for the state.

""If just one major industrial falls, it is the beginning of a domino effect across Tasmania,"" she said.

""That is catastrophic for the Tasmanian economy, for the energy system and for Tasmanian families and communities."" Shane Power, chair of the Bell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone, said BBA's closure would be ""devastating"".

He said the business employed over a thousand people directly and indirectly — which equated to $120 million in salaries and about $240 million in supply chain investment.

""If we don't have jobs for these people, the local economy will suffer,"" he said.

""Not just at Bell Bay and in the immediate surrounds but across northern Tasmania.

""It would be absolutely devastating to lose such a large industrial business.""
Hydro Tasmania chief executive Rachel Watson said the negotiations were commercial in confidence.

""We've worked hard to put our best possible offer forward. But we cannot offer uncommercial terms,"" Ms Watson said.

""We will continue to negotiate in good faith, working with Rio Tinto and other stakeholders in an effort to achieve a positive outcome for Tasmania.""

None,Iron ore mining shows no signs of slowing despite price drop concerns,Charlie McLean and Alistair Bates,538,98,"Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP are continuing to expand their iron ore foot print in the Pilbara, despite projections indicating long-term demand for the mineral is waning.

On Tuesday, Rio confirmed a $1.1 billion investment for mining new deposits at its West Angelas operations, extending the mine's life ""for years to come"".

In June it opened a new $2.4 billion iron ore mine near Paraburdoo, and confirmed its investment in mining another major ore deposit with Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting. A day before Rio's West Angelas announcement, WA's environmental watchdog recommended approving a major expansion to BHP's Jimblebar mine.

The investment wave comes at an uncertain time for Australia's iron ore industry, with some industry analysts suggesting the region's title as the world's biggest iron ore supplier could be under threat in the longer term.

Those predictions are being driven by a slowdown in China's building industry, and the emergence of new mines in Brazil and Africa, containing higher-grade iron ore deposits than the Pilbara.

But mining investments consultant Phillip Kirchlechner said the situation was more complicated.

""There's certainly an argument for increasing production [in the Pilbara] as well,"" he said.

""China has new pillar industries, wind turbines and electric vehicles for example.

""China wants to essentially destroy the German car industry … and so this will constitute, possibly, additional demand for steel in the future that would come out of China.""
Digging deeper
Mr Kirchlechner, who had worked for both Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group, said there was another reason the major miners were looking for new ore deposits.

After 60 years of mining, the Pilbara's highest-grade deposits are gone. ""The low-hanging fruit is already taken, so increasingly you have to mine deeper,"" Mr Kirchlechner said.

""So there is a scenario of increasing risk as well by having to process the impurities in the iron ore, which are increasing.""

Mine rehabilitation scrutiny grows
As the footprint of the Pilbara iron ore industry grows, so too does the environmental scrutiny of their operations.

The WA Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approval of the Jimblebar expansion included a comment raising concerns about mining rehabilitation.

When new mines are approved in WA, the companies must commit to returning the impacted areas into a state as close to their original condition as possible.

But the EPA report said there was ""limited evidence"" that proponents had successfully rehabilitated areas that had been subject to large-scale mining. The EPA said it would renew its focus on rehabilitation when assessing future mining proposals.

University of Western Australia senior research fellow Todd Erickson said the commentary was surprising.

The plant ecologist has helped lead multiple rehabilitation projects with both BHP and Rio Tinto, with some small-scale success.

He acknowledged the low rates of rehabilitation were ""pretty hard to swallow"".

""Any mine rehabilitation in a dry hot desert is quite complex, just because of the given environment,"" Dr Erickson said. ""If mining companies continue to use old practices, they'll most likely get less of a result back.""

In a statement, a BHP spokesperson noted the EPA's warning.

""Last financial year, our WAIO [Western Australian Iron Ore] progressive rehabilitation programme completed more than 1,000 hectares of land rehabilitation, with the majority delivered by Traditional Owner rehabilitation contractors,"" it said.

To date, 14 per cent of the 149,700 hectares of land disturbed by BHP's mining operations has been rehabilitated.

None,Robe River JV to invest $483m in West Angelas Sustaining Project,GlobalData,3434,528,"io Tinto, Mitsui and Nippon Steel have committed to investing A$733m ($482.8m) to develop the West Angelas Sustaining Project, with Rio Tinto’s contribution being A$389m.

This project is part of the Robe River joint venture (JV) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The Robe River JV is owned by Rio Tinto (53%), Mitsui Iron Ore (33%) and Nippon Steel (14%). The West Angelas Sustaining Project aims to develop new iron ore deposits and has received necessary state and federal government approvals.

The deposits will sustain the West Angelas hub’s total annual production capacity of 35 million tonnes, ensuring continued long-term mining operations.

Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Matthew Holcz said: “The West Angelas Sustaining Project is built on strong and committed partnerships, both with the joint venture members Mitsui and Nippon Steel, as well as the Yinhawangka and Ngarlawangga peoples. “The West Angelas hub has been an integral part of Rio Tinto Iron Ore since 2002. Securing these approvals ensures ongoing investment in the hub as we continue to supply high-quality, reliable iron ore to meet our global customers’ demand now and into the future.”

Rio Tinto stated that it has collaborated with the Yinhawangka and Ngarlawangga people to develop cultural heritage management plans for the West Angelas Sustaining Project, ensuring the protection and management of cultural heritage and the environment.

The project will make use of the current West Angelas processing facilities and include the development of new infrastructure precincts, along with the construction of 22km of haul roads.

The mined ore will be autonomously trucked to the West Angelas hub, with first ore expected by 2027.

Approximately 600 jobs will be created during construction and the project will sustain around 950 full-time equivalent roles once operational.

The West Angelas Sustaining Project is part of Rio Tinto’s series of replacement projects in the Pilbara region.

Furthermore, work has advanced on the pre-feasibility study for Rhodes Ridge, said to be one of the largest and highest-quality undeveloped iron ore deposits globally.

The project aims for an initial capacity of up to 40 million tonnes per annum, with plans to commence ore production by 2030.

In August, Rio Tinto announced a A$180m investment to commence the Norman Creek access project at the Amrun bauxite mine in Queensland, Australia.

The West Angelas Sustaining Project will involve mining new areas to keep production at about 35 million tons of the steelmaking ingredient each year, Rio said in a statement Tuesday. The group has received all government approvals and first production should begin in 2027.

“The West Angelas hub has been an integral part of Rio Tinto Iron Ore since 2002,” Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Officer Matthew Holcz said. “Securing these approvals ensures ongoing investment in the hub as we continue to supply high-quality, reliable iron ore to meet our global customers’ demand now and into the future.”

Rio is contending with falling ore grades and dwindling reserves across several of its current operations, driving the company to invest heavily in the region to sustain production. The company needs to build a major new mine every year for the rest of this decade to maintain output. The problem is not company-specific, with other miners in the region also battling with the problem.

In March, Rio announced it would spend $1.8 billion to expand its Brockman iron ore hub in the Pilbara region to to maintain production levels as older mines depleted. Rio’s share of the West Angelas investment will be $389 million.

None,Ideon and Rio Tinto Global Partnership Applies Next-Generation Subsurface Intelligence to Reduce Cost and Accelerate Critical Minerals Supply,Business Wire,1474,169,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Ideon Technologies, the global leader in subsurface intelligence, announced a landmark enterprise partnership with Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest and most progressive mining companies. The five-year enterprise agreement is a major commitment by Rio Tinto and Ideon to solving mining’s hardest problem – geological uncertainty (not knowing fully what lies in the Earth beneath our feet) – which makes it difficult to identify, develop, and recover critical minerals as quickly and efficiently as the world needs them. This is how long-term value will be generated in critical mineral exploration and development — scalable, intelligent, and highly integrated.

Geological uncertainty impedes growth, slows investment, drives costs, and delays time to market. The less uncertainty mining companies have in the subsurface (and ultimately in the outcome of their mine plans), the quicker they can move, the more value they can unlock with their capital, and the more they can compound value over time.  Ideon will apply its proprietary REVEAL™ subsurface intelligence platform to support Rio Tinto’s strategic efforts to unlock value across a range of different use cases and commodities (including copper and iron ore), while advancing its vision for the mine of the future. These efforts will build on current investments in Remote Operations Centres (ROCs) and automation to drive operational performance, reduce costs, and uphold the highest safety standards.

The Ideon REVEAL™ Platform combines the power of cosmic-ray muons — subatomic particles created by supernova explosions in space — with advanced geophysical sensing technologies, multi-physics data integration, and AI-powered services. It generates high-resolution, high-velocity, 3D models of the Earth’s subsurface, enabling mining companies to identify, map, characterize, monitor, and extract ore bodies faster, more efficiently, with greater confidence. This results in faster targeting, shorter development timelines, reduced operational risk, and a smaller environmental footprint.

Article content
This partnership represents the first global-scale adoption of the Ideon REVEAL™ Platform by a Tier 1 mining company. The initial phase of the global rollout spans six of Rio Tinto’s largest operations across multiple continents, addressing a range of high-value operational challenges across the entire exploration and mining value chain.

Article content
Today’s announcement builds on several years of collaboration between the two companies, including a successful deployment at Bingham Canyon — one of the world’s largest copper mines. There, Ideon muon-based imaging technology enhanced geological models, reconciled production tonnage, and provided a robust decision-making tool for operational planning. The partnership underscores the growing appetite for deep-tech solutions that unlock value across traditional industries like mining, energy, and infrastructure.

Article content
“Global demand for critical minerals is surging, driven by the need for energy resilience, rapid expansion of AI infrastructure, and geopolitical imperatives around security of supply,” said Gary Agnew, Co-Founder & CEO of Ideon Technologies. “Yet the way we map and recover these resources hasn’t fundamentally changed in decades. The $12 trillion gap in critical mineral supply cannot be closed through incremental improvement. It requires the application of breakthrough technologies, bold leadership, and disciplined execution. Rio Tinto is demonstrating all three. “Our partnership goes far beyond technology trials,” added Agnew, “it’s about unlocking the future of mining through real enterprise integration that improves productivity, reduces cost, and increases confidence. By embedding our platform directly into Rio Tinto operations, we’re helping to re-engineer workflows, enabling faster, high confidence exploration and mining decisions. This is how long-term value will be generated in critical mineral exploration and development — scalable, intelligent, and highly integrated.”

None,Fund manager's stocks fall on ASIC allegations of bogus ESG claims after it invested in BHP and Rio Tinto,Cameron England,3884,760,"Shares in fund manager Fiducian Group Ltd (ASX: FID) fell more than 3% after the corporate regulator launched a Supreme Court action alleging it engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct about its environmental, social and governance (ESG) fund.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is alleging that Fiducian Investment Management Services Limited (FIMSL) ""failed to act with care and diligence as the responsible entity of the Diversified Social Aspirations Fund"", and has launched civil penalty proceedings in the NSW Supreme Court.

ASIC said the fund was seeking to fill client needs for ""socially responsible"" or ""ethical"" investment options and was open for investments between 2015 and 2024.

Allegation fund failed to follow its own rules
ASIC is alleging that the fund manager used underlying investment funds or other managers that had their own ESG methodologies and thresholds for choosing investments; however, ASIC says these processes did not align with the approach that Fiducian had set out in its product disclosure statement (PDS).

The PDS of the Fund stated that: 'The share portfolios comprise investments in companies that aim to be positive for society and for the environment and aim to avoid investments in harmful activities'. It also specified a number of industries or activities that the Fund would avoid investing in. ASIC also alleges the PDS of the Fund contained false and misleading statements that it would monitor the portfolio exposure and investment styles of the Underlying Funds in circumstances where FIMSL did not have the requisite information to conduct that monitoring.

ASIC is also alleging that FIMSL failed to comply with its compliance plan ""when it failed to record and lodge investor complaints …  and when it failed to address investor concerns that the fund held investments contrary to the representations made in the PDS such as investments in BHP Billiton Limited, Rio Tinto Limited, Woodside Petroleum Limited, Newcrest Mining Limited and Orica Limited''.

ASIC is seeking declarations, financial penalties, and adverse publicity orders.

Fiducian Group said in a statement to the ASX that it had cooperated with ASIC's investigations to date and ""is closely reviewing the court documents and the allegations made''.

As the matter is now before the Court, FIMSL or the company won't make any other comment at this time.

Fidcuian shares were 3.3% lower at $12.73. The company in August reported revenue from ordinary activities of $89.4 million, up 10.6%, and a net profit of $15 million, up 23.5%.

It declared a final dividend of 24.7 cents per share, fully franked. The company will hold its annual general meeting on October 9.

None,The controversial GST deal with the states is under review. There are better alternatives,"Stephen Bartos, Professor of Economics, University of Canberra",2916,625,"Treasurer Jim Chalmers last week announced the Productivity Commission will review the 2018 deal that gave states a guaranteed minimum share of the goods and services tax (GST).

Within minutes, the Western Australian Treasurer Rita Saffioti responded with a promise to fight to keep WA’s “fair share” of the GST. She announced a “fairness fighter” team would be set up in the WA Treasury.

The reason WA is worried is that the 2018 deal gives it a higher share of funding than it would have received under the previous formula, which took into account states’ own capacity to raise revenue. The WA government has been raking in revenue thanks to mining royalties, which have mushroomed since the mining boom, collecting more than A$10 billion a year for the past three years.

Thanks to high iron ore and gas prices – on top of the special GST deal – WA now has a large budget surplus, when other states and territories are struggling.

A booming surplus
A budget update last week revealed WA had a higher than expected $3.7 billion surplus for 2024-25. The West Australian newspaper said “the strong result is sure to put pressure on the 2018 GST deal”.

The Commonwealth Grants Commission was established in 1933 to advise the Federal government on grants to financially weak states. Since July 2000 that has included advice on how to distribute the billions in revenue collected nationally through the GST. For much of its history it applied a principle of “horizontal fiscal equalisation”. This meant giving each state and territory roughly equal budget capacity to provide public services such as schools, hospitals and roads. It took account of disadvantages like remoteness and a host of other factors, along with states’ ability to fund services from their own revenue.

The 2018 deal flies in the face of equalisation. It gives all states in theory a guaranteed minimum share of the GST pool, regardless of their revenue. In practice, this gives WA much greater fiscal capacity because of its royalties. Without the deal, WA would receive a lower share of the GST – which, taking account of its own resources, would still put it on the same footing as other states.

Whether WA residents deserve better services because their state sits on mineral resources is a matter of opinion. Obviously WA politicians think this only fair. Other states might disagree. The problems with the 2018 deal
Most economists and commentators outside WA are critical of the 2018 deal that carved up GST revenues. Economist Saul Eslake calls it “the worst public policy decision of the 21st century thus far”. He notes the cost – over the next four years, WA will receive $26.3 billion more from the carve-up of GST revenues than it would otherwise have done.

Another economist, Robert Breunig at the Australian National University, has called for an end to the deal. He points out that WA benefited from Commonwealth grants continuously from 1933 through 1968, and from 1981 to 2000. WA never complained the system was unfair in that period – nor did other states, even though WA was benefiting.

The deal was introduced by the Morrison government for political purposes, to win WA seats in parliament. Labor supported the deal because it too wanted WA votes. It is enormously popular in WA. So a recommendation to simply abolish the deal may not gain traction; the government will not want a running battle with WA ahead of the next federal election.

A new system is needed
The Productivity Commission will therefore need to think laterally. Fortunately its terms of reference are broad enough to allow it to consider alternatives.

While simply scrapping the 2018 deal might not be feasible, moving to an altogether new system could be a way forward.

An option worth considering is to split the grants system into two parts.

One part would distribute some of the GST – say, half – on a simple per capita (per person) basis. States like New South Wales and Victoria support moving to a per capita formula because at present they get less than a per capita share. This would provide all states and territories with some budget certainty, but smaller ones, and WA, would gain less than at present. They would need a top-up.

That top-up could be delivered by a separate fund, using the remaining half of the GST revenue to provide grants to overcome state and territory disadvantages and to meet special needs. It would remain open to WA to argue, as it does now, that it needs Commonwealth grants to support infrastructure for mining.

Other states could make their own arguments for special needs.

A feature of such a system could be making such grants conditional on the state or territory using the funds to reduce their disadvantages.

One of the frustrations in the system at present is that the Northern Territory is highly subsidised by other states (that is, it receives a higher share of GST funds, meaning others get less) due to remote disadvantage and a high First Nations population. Although it receives higher funding due to these factors, it still puts most of its budget into Darwin and surrounds.

Services for remote communities and meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait island people are comparatively low priorities. A new system of more accountable funding would help to address this anomaly.

None,US judge to approve Rio Tinto’s Mongolia mine settlement,GlobalData,1117,108,"US district judge is poised to approve Rio Tinto’s $138.75m settlement related to its Oyu Tolgoi mine expansion in Mongolia.  

The lawsuit alleged that the Anglo-Australian mining company misled investors by hiding issues related to its $7bn underground expansion project, reported Reuters. 

In June, a preliminary settlement was reached with the shareholders of Montreal-based Turquoise Hill Resources, awaiting approval from US district judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan.   At a recent hearing, Liman expressed his readiness to approve the settlement but did not sign off, awaiting further details on fund distribution from shareholders’ lawyers. 

Rio Tinto has not admitted any wrongdoing in the settlement agreement.  

The lawsuit sought damages for Turquoise Hill shareholders for the period from July 2018 to July 2019, during which the company was predominantly owned by Rio Tinto.  The shareholders were guided by funds managed by Pentwater Capital Management, a firm based in Chicago. 

In a court filing on 10 September, Pentwater stated that the settlement amount accounts for 34–43% of the damages it believed could be substantiated at trial.  

It characterised the settlement as reasonable, considering the risks associated with ongoing litigation.  

Turquoise Hill, a company focused on a single asset, held a 66% ownership in the Oyu Tolgoi mine, while the Mongolian Government owned the remaining 34%. 

Pentwater has accused Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill of deceiving investors by claiming the Oyu Tolgoi mine was progressing “on plan” and “on budget,” even though there were delays of up to two-and-a-half years and cost overruns of up to $1.9bn.  

In 2019, Rio Tinto disclosed the possible cost overrun of $1.9bn, revising total capital expenditures (capex) to between $6.5bn and $7.2bn. 

In 2022, Rio Tinto acquired the remaining 49% of Turquoise Hill that it did not previously own for $3.3bn, thereby fully integrating the mine into its copper portfolio.

None,Inside the plan to rebuild Juukan Gorge rock shelter destroyed by Rio Tinto,Nicolas Perpitch,2768,438,"A full-scale replica of the Juukan Gorge cave, destroyed in 2020 by mining company Rio Tinto to an avalanche of international condemnation, will be built around the remains of the original in Western Australia's north.

Used by Indigenous people for 47,000 years, it was blasted in 2020 in a legally sanctioned move to expand one the company's Pilbara iron ore mines.

Five years on, an enormous feat of engineering and artistry is underway to build a realistic re-creation to then place on country as part of the site's rehabilitation.

While the cost and timeline for completion is unclear, Rio Tinto itself is footing the bill as part of its redress agreement with Traditional Owners. Filling the void
Puutu Kunti Kurrama Land Committee chair Burchell Hayes said the new shelter aimed to restore Indigenous Australians' sense of belonging to the area by remediating damage caused by Rio Tinto.
Mr Hayes said while it was unclear what cultural significance the replica would bring once it was complete, he knew his people did not want to be left with a permanent void on the landscape.

He said they were inspired ""to ensure that something was placed back there to resemble what our memories of the gorge and the rock shelter looked like for us"".

""It is a significant cultural feature on our country, and we want to make sure that future generations continue to be able to come out on country and see what was possible and what was achieved.""
Immersive experience
The project is in its early stages, but impressive results were already emerging.

In a studio in Perth's Osborne Park, technicians developed an immersive, virtual reality recreation of the rock shelter based off a collection of about 150 photos, and the memories of Indigenous people.

The designers will use that to construct physical pieces of the cave to eventually be transported to the Pilbara and assembled on site. Daniel Browne, the director of CDM Studios, said his team created the first digital version and took it to Traditional Owners who would say they remembered a particular feature, like a specific rock, a 'moon pool' or a hole in the roof, and that would be added in.

""Every recollection we can get will help piece this cave together,"" Mr Browne said. French inspiration
As part of the project, a delegation from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama (PKKP) and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation is in France visiting similar replicas of the famous Lascaux and Chauvet caves.

Located in south-western and south-eastern France, the caves are some of the most celebrated and visited prehistoric sites in the country.
Hundreds of animal paintings on the walls of Chauvet have been dated to 36,000 years ago, and more than 17,000 years in Lascaux.

In the case of the Chauvet replica, huge steel structures were sprayed with a layer of mortar and natural pigments to create an identical copy of the original cave.

Artists then recreated each detail of the cave surface and reproduced each animal painting in detail.
The Chauvet cave cost almost $100 million ($55m Euros) and took eight years to build.

""We want to understand what went into the design and the construction ... how they were able to use the original traditional methods of painting those stencils on the cave,"" Mr Hayes said.
The PKKP's director of land and heritage Denis Coutant said the French cave recreations were done to minimise damage by tourists and used 3D scans to exactly map out every feature.

The Juukan rock shelter replica has no such luxury, with the recreation relying largely on people's memory.
""So it does have a depth and a very sensitive meaning to it,"" Mr Coutant said.

'Tangible surface'
Adding to the challenge, traditional owners do not want steel used in the construction, because it can corrode.

Instead, Mr Browne and his team have taken ""texture stamps"" directly off Pilbara rocks, including remnants of Juukan, that will be turned into concrete moulds to make sections of the on-site replica.
""We worked out a way to clone the surface over so the geometry was much, much sharper,"" he said.

""We want that tangible, tangible surface."" The goal is for the Juukan replica to ensure such destruction does not happen again.

""It has to be a legacy that we leave to the PKKP people and to other people in the country, and potentially even in other countries,"" Mr Coutant said.

""There are First Nations everywhere in the world who have to deal with mining or large-scale projects who are suffering as well from an impact on their country, and impact on their own heritage.""",16/10/2025 8:08,Ethical Responsibility|Customer Orientation|Accountability,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Brand Perception & Reputation|Remediation & Restoration Efforts|Corporate & Historical Responsibility,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative"", ""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""positive"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""destroyed by Rio Tinto"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""destroyed by Rio Tinto"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""destroyed by Rio Tinto"", ""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""rebuild Juukan Gorge rock shelter"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""rebuild Juukan Gorge rock shelter""}",ABC News (AU)
None,"Buy, hold, sell: Baby Bunting, Rio Tinto, and SRG Global",James Mickleboro,2062,301,"The team at Morgans has been busy reviewing recent updates this week.

Three ASX shares that it has given its verdict on are listed below. Here's what the broker is saying about them:

Baby Bunting Group Ltd (ASX: BBN)
Morgans has been looking at this baby products retailer's trading update, which was in line with expectations.

As a result, it feels that its shares remain fully priced at current levels and has retained its trim rating (one notch above sell and one notch below hold) with a $2.70 price target. It explains:

BBN has provided a trading update which was broadly in line with expectations, with comp sales YTD up 2.2%. FY26 guidance was reiterated for pro forma NPAT of $17-20m. Earnings will be skewed to the 2H driven by stronger sales growth post store refurbishments and incremental margin improvement. The three newly refurbished stores continue to trade well, with an average 30% sales uplift YTD, in line with the 28% reported at the time of the FY result.

This is above the target range of 15-25%, however we still think it is early days. Whilst we acknowledge the significant leverage if the business can return to 10% EBITDA margins, we believe this relies on solid execution, and think this is reflected in current valuation. Given the share price strength, we retain our TRIM recommendation.

Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO)
This mining giant delivered a solid quarterly update this week. However, it notes that a very strong finish to the year will be needed to achieve its guidance. In light of this and its stretched valuation, the broker has downgraded Rio Tinto's shares to a trim rating with a $117.00 price target. It explains:

Operational delivery was again solid, but RIO is relying on a stellar 4Q just to achieve the low end of Pilbara shipments guidance. Copper again was the standout, driving group momentum and sentiment. Valuation starting to stretch moving beyond a positive TSR, prompting TRIM rating.

SRG Global Ltd (ASX: SRG)
Morgans is a fan of this engineering services company's acquisition of Total Ams and believes it will be significantly accretive to earnings. It also likes that it will improve diversification and provide exposure to the government's significant maritime defence spend. In response, Morgans has put an accumulate rating and $3.00 price target on its shares. It said:

The acquisition of TAMS on a cheap multiple is materially EPS accretive and is on strategy, improving diversification and increasing exposure to the government's significant maritime defence spend over the next decade. In our view, the added scale, diversity and strong forecast EPS growth over FY26 (+25%) and FY27 (+16%), should ensure the stock continues to re-rate. Moreover, the balance sheet remains conservative meaning SRG can continue to supplement organic growth with further acquisitions. Our target price rises to $3.00 from $2.10.

None,US judge set to approve Rio Tinto's $138.75 million Mongolia mine settlement,Unknow,2426,198,"NEW YORK :A U.S. judge on Wednesday said he was ready to approve Rio Tinto's agreement to pay $138.75 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the Anglo-Australian mining giant of defrauding investors by concealing problems with its $7 billion underground expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia.

Rio Tinto had reached a preliminary settlement with shareholders of the former Montreal-based Turquoise Hill Resources in June, pending approval from Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman.  

Liman at a hearing on Wednesday said he was ready to approve the settlement, but did not sign off on it yet because he was waiting for the shareholders' lawyers to inform him of what they planned to do with any funds left after initial distributions.

Rio Tinto did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. The lawsuit sought damages on behalf of Turquoise Hill shareholders between July 2018 and July 2019, when that company, then listed in Toronto, was majority-owned by Rio Tinto. 

Shareholders were led by funds advised by Chicago-based Pentwater Capital Management.

Pentwater said in a September 10 court filing that the settlement amount represented between 34 per cent and 43 per cent of the damages it believed it could prove at trial, describing it as reasonable given the risk of continued litigation.

Turquoise Hill had been a single-asset company owning 66 per cent of the Oyu Tolgoi mine, with Mongolia's government owning 34 per cent.

Pentwater accused Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill of fraudulently assuring that the Oyu Tolgoi mine was ""on plan"" and ""on budget,"" even as it was falling up to 2-1/2 years behind schedule and running as much as $1.9 billion over budget.

Rio announced the possible $1.9 billion overrun in 2019, and projected total capital expenditures of $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion.

In 2022, Rio Tinto bought the 49 per cent of Turquoise Hill it did not already own for $3.3 billion, fully integrating the mine into its copper portfolio.

None,Where does Macquarie think Rio Tinto shares are going in 2026?,James Mickleboro,466,60,"Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO) shares have been in the spotlight this week.

That's because the mining giant released its eagerly anticipated third quarter update on Tuesday.

Should you be buying its shares following this update? Let's see what analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd (ASX: MQG) are saying about the large-cap miner.

What is the broker saying?
Macquarie was pleased with Rio Tinto's operational performance during the third quarter. This was especially the case with its Pilbara iron ore operations. It said:

Pilbara iron ore (100% basis) production/ shipments of 84.1/84.3mt were both in line with VA consensus (-1%). New Pilbara blend grade resulted in a reduction in SP10 from 29% to 9%. Guidance retained (lower end of the 323-338mt). RIO require 4QCY25 at 88mt to meet guidance. Unit costs guidance US$23.0-24.50/t unchanged. Lowering Pilbara blend grade could improve unit costs.

The broker was also pleased to see that the miner delivered copper production in line with expectations for the period. It adds:

Copper in line: Mined & refined copper of 204kt (consolidated basis) came in line (-1%) with Escondida's 110.7kt beat (+6%) flat QoQ, Oyu Tolgoi's 58.9kt (RIO share) delivering a small beat (+4%) with higher U/G production offset by Kennecott's maintenance impacted miss on both mined and refined copper (-42%/-58%).

Should you invest?
Rio Tinto remains the broker's preferred large-cap mining exposure. This is due to it having stronger short-term catalysts and opportunities to improve its unit costs. It said:

We continue to prefer RIO to BHP due to stronger short-term catalysts and cost improvement opportunities. RIO's portfolio simplification, capital discipline, and ramp-ups at Simandou and OT offer tactical upside. We note first ore was loaded onto rail in October with ramp-up tracking to plan despite fatalities. We believe RIO has room to improve unit costs following past operational setbacks.

However, despite preferring Rio Tinto over BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), it doesn't necessarily mean that it thinks investors should be buying its shares.

According to the note, Macquarie has retained its neutral rating on the miner's shares with an unchanged price target of $115.00. This is lower than its current share price of $129.00 and implies potential downside of 11% over the next 12 months.

Commenting on its neutral recommendation, the broker said:

Neutral. RIO delivered a solid result with record 3Q iron ore shipments. Copper was assisted by strong grade performance from Escondida and OT ramp-up. All eyes move to the 2025 capital markets day, where we believe CEO Simon Trott will reinforce a simplified operating model and reduce costs.

None,Rio Tinto’s iron ore exports remain stable in Q3 2025,GlobalData,1138,261,"io Tinto’s iron ore exports remained stable in the third quarter (Q3) ending 30 September 2025, compared to the previous year. 

The company continues to invest in maintaining its production levels in spite of plateauing steel demand from China, reported Bloomberg. 

In Q3, the company exported 84.3 million tonnes (mt) of iron ore, a 6% increase from the previous quarter. Its full-year shipment guidance was between 323mt and 338mt. Rio Tinto reported a 9% year-on-year (YoY) increase in copper equivalent production due to robust performance across all its operations. 

The company reported progress in copper output, with total production on track to reach the upper end of its annual forecast. 

It attributed this progress to a strong ramp-up at the Oyu Tolgoi project and the Kennecott mine, which also met expectations amid major maintenance at the concentrator and smelter. Rio Tinto’s operations in the Pilbara region represented its second-highest Q3 shipments since 2019, showing a 6% rise from the previous quarter. 

The company secured government approvals for the West Angelas Sustaining Project as part of its iron ore replacement strategy. 

Rio Tinto upgraded its full-year bauxite production guidance, driven by improved operations, particularly at the Amrun site. 

The mining company stated that it has introduced a new operating model and executive team aimed at simplifying its business structure and enhancing shareholder value. 

The company has been divided into three primary divisions, namely Iron Ore, Aluminium and Lithium, and Copper. Borates, and Iron and Titanium have been placed under review. 

Rio Tinto chief executive Simon Trott said: “We continue to strengthen performance from our assets, setting back-to-back quarterly production records in our bauxite business and at Oyu Tolgoi – where the underground ramp-up remains on track to boost copper output by more than 50% this year. 

“We are focused on delivering a strong finish to the year from the Pilbara. Our growth projects are also progressing at pace – at Simandou, we started loading first ore at the mine for movement down the rail and to the port in October. 

“We are on track to meet production guidance for 2025, with an upwards revision to bauxite this quarter, and are well positioned to deliver compelling mid-term production growth.” ",14/10/2025 22:20,Execution|Performance,Production & Output Management|Investment & Portfolio Performance,"{""Production & Output Management"": ""positive"", ""Investment & Portfolio Performance"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Production & Output Management"": ""remained stable"", ""Investment & Portfolio Performance"": ""continues to invest in maintaining its production levels""}",Mining Technology
None,Rio Tinto Ramps Up Copper Output as Iron Ore Exports Steady,Bloomberg News,5070,568,"(Bloomberg) — Rio Tinto Group’s third-quarter copper output jumped 10% from the year before, as the world’s second-biggest miner seeks to keep ramping up production of the metal that’s key to the energy transition.

Article content
Output from Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine that’s in Chile, grew 9% in the three months through September, while production from its Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia soared a record 78%. That’s supporting the company’s growth agenda even as shipments of iron ore — still its main cash cow — remain steady. Mining majors are looking to boost exposure to copper amid a bullish sentiment for the metal, driven by its use in wiring for renewable energy and data centers. Rio is still seeking to expand production of iron ore, with its Simandou project in Guinea loading its first ore from the mine for transport within weeks, it said. At Oyu Tolgoi, “the underground ramp-up remains on track to boost copper output by more than 50% this year,” new Chief Executive Officer Simon Trott said in the quarterly production statement Tuesday. “Our growth projects are also progressing at pace.”

Third-quarter iron ore shipments were steady from the year before, as the major producer invests heavily to maintain output despite plateauing Chinese demand for steel.

Article content
Rio exported 84.3 million tons of the steelmaking ingredient over the three months ended September. That was 6% higher than the previous quarter. Rio maintained full-year guidance of 323 million tons to 338 million tons. Disruptions caused earlier in the year by Australia’s cyclone season will mean Rio will need to have a “big” fourth quarter to meet its production guidance, Barclays Bank Plc analysts including Amos Fletcher said in a note.

Article content
Tensions in the iron ore market have intensified amid China Mineral Resources Group Co.’s push to consolidate the country’s buying power. The state-backed agency, which now represents a large part of the steel mills, has clashed with Rio’s biggest rival BHP in recent months, culminating in a ban on purchases of US-dollar-denominated cargoes. The dispute underscores the shifting power dynamics between Chinese buyers and Australian producers, including Rio.

After taking on the role in August, Trott made his first significant move by reshaping the company’s leadership structure, removing the positions of Australia and minerals heads.

(Bloomberg) -- The US-China dispute over Beijing’s control of rare earth supplies has yet to be resolved, the head of a visiting US congressional delegation said after meeting Chinese officials, signaling a key irritant persists in bilateral relations.

Representative Adam Smith described continuing challenges on the matter in a press briefing on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, where he’s leading the?[first](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/china-hosts-us-house-group-as-tiktok-trade-talks-gain-momentum)?official visit by US House lawmakers since 2019 as relations steady before a?[potential meeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/xi-asks-trump-to-avoid-taking-restrictive-trade-measures-in-call)?between the countries’ presidents.

**“I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question,” Smith said, without specifying what the sticking points are. “I think that that still needs to be worked on.”**

China dominates the global supply and processing of the minerals, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. Beijing has used its position as a?[strategic lever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/china-deploys-rare-earths-as-weapon-in-trade-war-with-trump)?as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalated earlier this year.

The two governments reached a framework agreement in June that includes a?[Chinese commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-27/china-says-it-confirms-trade-framework-details-with-us)?to review applications for shipping rare earth magnets, although few details of the deal have been disclosed. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last week said supplies to his country had “bounced back up significantly,” although European companies have complained about?[shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-rare-earth-product-exports-hit-highest-since-at-least-2012)?that threaten to halt production.

Smith also struck a note of caution in response to a reporter’s question about whether Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. will have any role in maintaining the app’s algorithm in the US. Citing privacy and security concerns, he said the matter has “not been 100% resolved,” while adding that he wasn’t privy to the negotiations.?

The US and China are nearing an agreement to hive off the US operations of social media platform TikTok to a consortium that includes software giant Oracle Corp. Under the spin-off arrangement being discussed, TikTok will be majority-owned and controlled by Americans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Many of the finer details of the agreement have yet to be made public.

Joined by US Ambassador to China David Perdue, the delegation’s visit may build more goodwill ahead of a possible sitdown between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in South Korea.?

Such a deal, which has been years in the making, would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two nations but has been contingent on an easing in tensions.

On the security front, Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged Beijing to engage in talks over its “rapidly growing nuclear arsenal” to prevent miscalculation.?

“When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation about it to make sure that we understand each other,” Smith said. He stressed the need for better military-to-military dialogue, a message he delivered in meetings with Chinese officials including Premier Li Qiang since the delegation arrived on Sunday.?

* **Australian rare earths, graphite firms eye US expansion**
* **Large, developed customer base is key attraction**
* **Investors show interest in critical minerals projects, execs say**

MELBOURNE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Some of Australia's most advanced critical minerals producers are moving forward on plans to build processing facilities in the United States, despite Australia's strategic push to build up its own domestic industry. An Australian delegation of critical minerals companies visited Washington and New York last week to meet senior administration officials and investors. ASX-listed firms including Australian Strategic Materials?[(ASM.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ASM.AX), Ionic Rare Earths?[(IXR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IXR.AX), and International Graphite?[(IG6.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IG6.AX)?are looking to expand in the U.S., company executives told Reuters.

The scale of the U.S. customer base is a major attraction, they said, given its rapidly developing electric vehicle, defence, and advanced manufacturing industries, as well as cheap energy and the hefty subsidies it is set to deploy. ""We've identified six states as ones that we're looking at seriously,"" said Chief Legal Officer Annaliese Eames of ASM, which is seeking to expand beyond its rare earths metallization plant in Korea. Of those states, ASM, an $85 million firm, is conducting detailed due diligence, including reviewing sites, in Oklahoma and South Carolina. What drew ASM to the U.S. was more than strong federal and state support and incentives. ""It's the commitment that they're making to grow the entire ecosystem,"" she said.

Some critical minerals firms that supply to customers in defense need to locate nearby for reasons of national security and the series of complex steps in turning raw materials into magnets used in everything from wind power to missiles. That is the case for Ionic Rare Earths, which is planning to replicate the magnet recycling technology it has developed in Belfast in several U.S. states, including Tennessee, where it is in advanced discussions, Managing Director Tim Harrison said. ""There are a number of other states that can provide very low cost of power... They also have a lower labor cost base and they have both federal and state governments that are willing to deploy immense funding,"" he told [Reuters.International](http://Reuters.International) Graphite, which is building an advanced processing plant in Western Australia, is also looking at options to build in the U.S. and Europe, to be more closely aligned to the specific requirements of its customers, CEO Andrew Worland said. China's restrictions on rare earths exports?[in April](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/)?galvanized the U.S. to supercharge its rare earths industry, and higher Western world prices that have emerged are attracting investors and greasing the wheels of project finance. Even so, acess to U.S. funding is expected to be highly competitive. Australia's Lynas Rare Earths?[(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), the biggest supplier outside China, warned last month that its heavy rare-earths processing plant in Texas may not go ahead after the Trump administration provided multibillion dollar funding to its U.S. rival.

# POLICY CHALLENGES

The trend highlights critical policy challenges in Australia that are impeding the government's ambition to develop new export markets beyond its mainstay fossil fuels. That opportunity was worth A$170 billion ($112 billion) to its economy by 2040, according to a PwC report as recently as 2023.""Australia has been struggling to set up the critical minerals industry beyond primary extraction,"" PwC Australia chief economist Amy Lomas said. Australia's high power and labor costs, and a cumbersome approvals process, are dragging on growth and diminishing the country's international competitiveness, major miners regularly?[complain](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bhp-flags-organic-copper-growth-us-allure-silent-big-buyouts-2025-09-15/). Meanwhile, advanced manufacturing is still a small sector, its development clipped by the closure of Australia's car industry in the 2010s.""For an Australian company to look at building it in Australia, where do we sell our materials? Where is the metals, alloys, magnet capacity being built? It’s not being built in Australia because our cost base is too expensive and we have minimal advanced manufacturing industry,"" Ionic's Harrison said. Still, Australia passed a A$17 billion production tax credit in February that will provide a 10% offset for critical minerals processors from 2027. It is also building critical minerals partnerships with allies including Japan, India and Britain that could deepen its customer base, PwC's Lomas added. ""Then that starts to set the foundations for Australia to be able to run a lot harder typically for midstream processing, and then ideally downstream processing,"" she said.

American Rare Earths has completed test mining and primary crushing of approximately 3,080 tonnes of rare earth ore at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek deposit. The company is conducting comminution optimization tests on 13.7 tonnes of ore samples to improve rare earth magnet element recoveries and project economics. The remaining ore will be used as feedstock for a demonstration plant, which will validate processing methods and support future technical studies. These efforts are expected to enhance the company’s position in the domestic permanent magnet industry and increase stakeholder confidence.

[US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto](https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/28947/us-buys-scandium-oxide-from-rio-tinto/)

https://preview.redd.it/v2wsy6wlxvqf1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44f8a5f123757f6819aa59df812be17fbe3b19b

**The Logistics Agency of the US Ministry of Defense (DLA) plans to buy scandium oxide worth up to 40 million dollars from a branch of the mining company Rio Tinto in the next five years.** The goal is to replenish strategic stocks for military and technological needs. Scandium is one of the rare earth minerals, and its role in military devices and advanced technology is crucial. Currently, the largest producer is China, which has introduced strict export controls.

""Until recently, we sourced scandium primarily from China. In late 2024, China introduced scandium export controls that limited the supply chain and prompted us to purchase for National Defense supplies,"" according to a DLA document released last week.?

**The plan is to buy a total of 6.4 tons of scandium oxide in the next five years, which in the first year amounts to almost two tons or about five percent of last year's total global production. Last year, according to the data of the American Geological Survey, 40 tons of scandium oxide were produced, with a total capacity of 80 tons.**

**In order to encourage domestic production, the US in August granted $10 million to Elk Creek Resources, an arm of the mining company NioCorp Developments, which plans to produce scandium in Nebraska. Until then, America had to import metal from abroad, and Rio Tinto was the only seller capable of meeting the state's needs in the required quantities.**

The management of the British-Australian company refused to comment on business details, **but it was pointed out that it is ""actively working with the US government to explore opportunities and take advantage of government support for greater domestic production and stabilization of the supply chain"".** In 2020, Rio Tinto researchers developed a process to extract high-purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production.

The company in Quebec, Canada, has been producing scandium oxide for three years, and the current capacity is three tons per year. ""Rio Tinto is in a unique position and can help supply materials critical to America's future,"" management told Reuters.

# ?? DFARS, Defense Primes &amp; Scandium: Why the Timing Matters

The Reuters scoop (Sept. 22) confirms the Defense Logistics Agency just opened a $40M, 5-year scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto to shore up the National Defense Stockpile. **But even more important — it explicitly cites the $10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp) in August to accelerate domestic scandium production.**

**Here’s why it matters: under DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a stopgap, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement are slated for November.**

# CMMC Final Rule: Key Takeaways for Defense Contractors

# IMHO~The Bottom Line:

# The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) just paid a contract price of $6,250/kg!— a strong benchmark for federal price support.*

**This pricing level is especially significant for NioCorp, which received a $10 million U.S. award in August to accelerate domestic scandium production. Unlike other suppliers, NioCorp plans to vertically integrate: producing scandium oxide, refining it into metal, and alloying it into Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloys —** the form required by defense and aerospace primes under DFARS regulations.?That integrated pathway allows NioCorp to potentially capture a similar material pricing (\~$6,250/kg) but also additional alloy-level premiums moving forward.

**In short, the DLA contract sets a price floor, confirms real demand, and validates the economics behind NioCorp’s business model. With federal buyers already valuing scandium this highly and policy driving secure domestic sourcing, NioCorp’s mine-to-alloy strategy is aligned perfectly to meet DFARS-compliant defense demand!**

# The Setup Before the Strike

Tomorrow kicks off NioCorp’s biggest showcase week in years: the **RedChip investor presentation at 4:15 PM EST (Sept. 24)** followed by **Mark Smith live with Maria Bartiromo at 7:30 AM EST (Sept. 25)**. That sequence is deliberate — first, Wall Street and institutions get the technical roadmap, then the very next morning the retail base and national audience hear the story on Fox Business. It’s a one-two punch engineered to maximize visibility.

But the real kicker dropped this week: **Reuters confirmed that the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency just awarded Rio Tinto a $40M scandium oxide contract (6.4 tonnes over five years)**, paying the equivalent of **\~$6,250/kg Sc?O?** (≈$9,600/kg scandium metal-equivalent). **That sets a** ***price floor*** **for Scandium in defense supply chains —** and with NioCorp potentially funded to advance utilities and site prep, **and with Mark Smith openly teasing Scandium alloy partnerships and November announcements, the timing could not be sharper.** Elk Creek is positioned to be **the only U.S. upstream source of Scandium** at scale, meaning the DLA’s stopgap with Rio Tinto is just that — a bridge until domestic supply comes online.

Put together, the picture is clear: **Phase 1 drilling complete with assays due mid-October, Scandium alloy breakthroughs lined up for November, and a Q4 DFS that folds in all upside just as EXIM/DFC financing comes to a head.** Against a backdrop of new federal critical mineral funding and active Pentagon stockpiling, NioCorp isn’t just a niobium play anymore — it’s becoming the cornerstone of a **North American multi-metal critical minerals complex.** Translation: the table is set, the catalysts are stacked, and starting tomorrow, the ignition sequence begins.

???**Bottom line:**?**Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine.” It’s shaping into the U.S. Resource Independence Keystone — Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths all under one roof.**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2029 and beyond.

""Rio Tinto is uniquely positioned to help secure materials critical to America's future,"" the group said in an emailed reply to a Reuters' request for [comment.Rio](http://comment.Rio) Tinto's facility in Quebec, Canada produced the first batch of scandium oxide three years ago and currently has the annual production capacity of 3 metric tons.

# ?? DFARS, Defense Primes &amp; Scandium: Why the Timing Matters

The **Reuters scoop** (Sept. 22) confirms the **Defense Logistics Agency just opened a $40M, 5-year scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto** to shore up the National Defense Stockpile. But even more important — it explicitly cites the **$10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp)** in August to accelerate domestic scandium production.

Here’s why it matters: under **DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement)**, U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) *must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources* for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a **stopgap**, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. **NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap**, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement might be coming in November.

# ?Bottom line: The DLA just telegraphed demand urgency. Rio fills a short-term gap, but NioCorp is the domestic structural answer, and defense primes will need its scandium + ScAl alloys for compliance. Shorts pressing now are ignoring that this setup is policy-driven and federally backstopped.

Have not heard anything since. Would have expected maybe a generic email from HR but nothing. I was advised that it can be a slow process and not to quit my current job, which is fine.

1jov4pj,"RVSN 20-F Breakdown: Israel Railways, Rio Tinto, and What’s Coming in 2025",robrgts,83,33,"Hello everyone, i’m writing this post to help clarify some of the doubts and hopefully stir the conversation down a better path. This post will surely get a lot of hate, but i see a lot of uninformed people spreading FUD either cause they lost money or want to troll. Hopefully this helps anyone that’s serious about their investment and needs some reassurance. The main thing that’s caused some confusion is the fact that most people only read or know about the 6-K and not the 20-F. The 6-K is only a summary of the 20-F that’s published in a PR format for easier reading. Depending on the company, you can find future guidance and some of the juicier things in the 6-K, but that wasn’t the case for us.

My aim with this post is to provide information on some of the things we’ve found in the 20-F that might be unknown to some of you.?

#Israel Railways

https://preview.redd.it/ckkaybqp18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5433734f83f77b64486a1ca734513c90c0cb4d

This excerpt highlights the current stage of their deal with Israeli Railways and what we can expect to come from them in the future. A lot people assumed that they were already paid for the 10 Main Line systems from January 31st 2023, but from our understanding based on this screenshot, seems like they’re still owed the majority of this amount once they finish installing the last of the systems. We suspect it took them this long because they needed to be certified first before installing their tech on passenger units, there isn’t much information on that currently.?


https://preview.redd.it/fjbjikfh18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9d92ee654dfb023b4f432592844da0de5d980e

As you can see this one is a bit different and goes into detail of just how huge this deal could be for Rail Vision in the near future. They have a long history working together and this is Rail Vision’s turf so i wouldn’t be surprised if this is where they get their first “big” contract. Installing their tech on 300 trains and possibly doubling that to 600 units for bidirectional functionality is a massive opportunity. At this stage, their tech would be recognized as successful and profitable for the business and would also help attract further interest from outside parties.



#Rio Tinto Iron Core

https://preview.redd.it/6yffowta18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ed7b31d07138242a535c6677912b4e65a0a480

This is a big one, a lot of us rightfully assumed that Rio Tinto was dead in the water so this is new to us and very important. From what we can read here, this deal is very similar to the one from India. Rail Vision signed a supply agreement with Hitachi Rail STS to provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing. The pilot ended in August 2022 and since then we haven’t heard anything from them. The thing is that they stopped testing altogether, they haven’t done pilots with any other company since then. It seems that they’ve been reviewing the data gathered by us and they’ve been planning the next phase to possibly procure our tech. This is evident now that they’re releasing tenders in Q2 2025 and Rail Vision is participating. Nothing is publicly confirmed as of yet, but this could be an unexpected catalyst before EOY.




#Existing Pilots

https://preview.redd.it/pnygldc818se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76e1af49c244af41f9f2e0bd98859cad235cc60d

From this paragraph right here we get a bit more information on how it is that they roll out their units for pilot testing. So first it mentions how they have multiple pilots running at the same time, these are the ones from North America, Central America, India and presumably South America with Vale. Most of these pilots started around the same time in 2024 and based on current data, we can expect these to finish by mid 2025.?



#Financials - Balance Sheet and Runway

As of Dec 2024, Rail Vision had $17.5M in cash, up from $3.3M the year prior. This comes from $24.1M in gross raised through private placements, warrant exercises, and the equity line.

With operating cash burn at $9.7M for 2024, they currently have about 1.5 to 2 years of runway if spending remains the same, more if pilot contracts convert and revenue goes up. That gives them time to push pilots into rollouts without needing to dilute.




#Research and Development (RnD)

https://preview.redd.it/rfwlwmzy08se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d0bdb1e50f461ca93e9ae3f45c94af45f3c861

Rail Vision’s RnD expenses for the year 2024 were $5.28 million, down from $7.15 million in 2023. This shows a 26% decrease YoY.

From this paragraph we can see they reduced their RnD team by 12 employees and spent less on equipment and materials. This is a positive sign as they’re phasing out of the heavy RnD phase, we should expect this trend to continue for future reports.?

Additionally there are some things i found regarding what they’re currently working on when it comes to RnD. These include: Maintenance and Predictive Maintenance, Data Services and Mapping.?




#Operating Loss

https://preview.redd.it/gu1vpv4218se1.jpg?width=1256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fbdf2cc8a217656ba9bfc59702ed17435be57a

Rail Vision reported an operating loss of $9 million which is an improvement from the $11.4 million in 2023. This is a 21% reduction YoY.

The two main reasons for this reduction are the reduced expenses from RnD which are down $1.87 million and also the higher revenue generated of $1.3 million. Again, we can expect these figures to get better and better in future reports.?

They’re improving on operational efficiency and they’re proving that they know what they’re doing when it comes to the management of their finances. If the prior pilots convert to full contracts in 2025 then we can expect profitability by H2 2025.??



#Opportunity Roadmap

https://preview.redd.it/74ivfo3k28se1.jpg?width=1312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57300b1f6ccef324b2026d92aec25bbd92bd2d2f

Also wanted to share a roadmap from u/Time_Shoulder_1493, i think its a good visual to show all of the active pilots and everything else Rail Vision is working on.



#Closing Remarks

In my own personal opinion, this ER is exactly what we expected. There isn’t any surprises when it comes to their financials, they’re reducing expenses by cutting their biggest spender which is RnD and growing their revenue through multiple clients. I believe this will only get better with time as they finish the current pilots and start gaining contracts. If these contracts come to fruition then i expect profitability by H2 2025.

I know this is a very difficult time we’re going through and??the lack of transparency from management only makes it worse. I believe that the general feeling we’re all experiencing could’ve been avoided if only they communicated with us. The good thing is that they’re working, they have presence in multiple countries and there’s potential contracts in the near future. They seem optimistic about what could possibly happen this year and they’re probably getting promising feedback from their pilots. For now i’ll remain patient and look forward to H1 2025.",2025/4/2 0:06,Collaboration|Performance,Partnership & Joint Ventures|Growth & Strategic Performance,"{""Partnership & Joint Ventures"": ""positive"", ""Growth & Strategic Performance"": ""positive""}",0.8,"{""Partnership & Joint Ventures"": ""supply agreement with Hitachi Rail STS to provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing"", ""Growth & Strategic Performance"": ""provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing""}",Reddit

Eu irei me mudar daqui a umas semanas para a avenida da conduta entre fanzeres e rio tinto.

None,Rio Tinto review shows rise in rape and bullying reports,Business,77,None,"Rio Tinto has said the number of its employees who reported they have experienced actual or attempted sexual assault or rape has increased over the last two years, despite efforts to improve its workplace culture in recent years. A report on the Anglo-Australian mining company, authored by the former Australian sex discrimination commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, found “mixed results” in its efforts to implement a programme to change its culture in an effort stamp out sexual assault, bullying and racism. Broderick’s 76-page report on the company, which employs 57,000 globally, noted that a rise in bullying against women was in part “retaliation” to Rio Tinto’s efforts to “promote gender diversity and inclusion”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The report revealed that eight allegations of rape or attempted rape in the past 12 months, up from five cases in 2021. The report also found 32 employees reported experiencing pressure or requests for sex or sexual acts, down from 37 people in 2021. Overall, 39% of survey respondents had experienced bullying in the last 12 months – up from 31% in 2021. “Generally, while reports of bullying increased across all genders, the largest increase between 2021 and 2024 was against women,” the report said. “This change can be explained by a range of factors including increasing retaliation in the form of gendered bullying as a response to Rio Tinto’s efforts to promote gender diversity and inclusion.” Related: Activist opposed to Rio Tinto lithium mine receives anonymous death threats Kellie Parker, Rio Tinto’s chief executive for Australia, said: “It’s horrible that people are still experiencing this awful behaviour.” She said there had been a “significant increase” in terminations as more people reported some of these behaviours to the company. “There’s definitely a spectrum of behaviour here,” she said. “You get low-level sexism and racism and people often once they’ve … been given feedback, they absolutely change. But some of the way more serious cases that we’ve seen, it’s been terminations, and that absolutely has happened across our business.” One in two women at the company were more likely to have experienced bullying in the last 12 months compared with 36% of men, the report said. Those figures were a deterioration from 2021, where 36% of women and 29% of men said they suffered bullying. The report found some men inside the company, which operates in 35 countries, felt aggrieved by diversification programmes in the company. “From men, resistance was primarily located in the sense of being undervalued or overlooked due to the perceived stronger focus on gender balance and diversity, with some expressing their view that there was reverse discrimination and that women were being hired who were not suitably qualified,” the report said. “There was specific resistance towards programmes and strategies targeted at women and other marginalised groups, such as leadership programmes.” Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, apologised to victims and vowed to continue with Rio’s programmes. “People are still experiencing behaviours and attitudes in our company that are unacceptable and harmful. I am greatly troubled by this and sincerely apologise on behalf of our leadership team to anyone affected.” Stausholm also pointed to points of progress outlined in the review, which showed some workers were noticing an improvement in the culture: two in three employees were quite confident Rio Tinto would make a “meaningful difference” in the next two years. “The review also shows that while progress is being made, achieving the sustained change we want to see in our culture will require ongoing focus and effort. My message today is that we will stay the course,” he said. Broderick – who was appointed by Rio in 2021 to conduct an independent review into its workplace culture – “applauded” some of the company’s efforts, which included investment in security upgrades at its camps, and setting quotas for increasing female participation in its workforce. “Two years on, the progress is evident and there is an ongoing commitment to this work. I am not surprised to see some areas where results haven’t improved, this is a normal part of the cultural change process,” she said. “With sustained focus from Rio Tinto, we should expect to see the positive change spread over time.” Almost 12,000 people were interviewed for the new report, covering Rio Tinto’s operations in locations including Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and Mongolia. Bonuses at Rio Tinto, which is valued at nearly ?84bn, have in part been linked to progress made in adopting recommendations made by Broderick.",2024/11/21 0:10,Respect|Diversity|Accountability,Workplace Respect & Fairness|Gender Equality & Representation|Reporting & Reputational Risk|Leadership Accountability,"{""Workplace Respect & Fairness"": ""negative"", ""Gender Equality & Representation"": ""positive"", ""Reporting & Reputational Risk"": ""positive"", ""Leadership Accountability"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Workplace Respect & Fairness"": ""reports of bullying increased across all genders, the largest increase between 2021 and 2024 was against women"", ""Gender Equality & Representation"": ""efforts to improve its workplace culture in recent years"", ""Reporting & Reputational Risk"": ""more people reported some of these behaviours to the company"", ""Leadership Accountability"": ""Jakob Stausholm, apologised to victims and vowed to continue with Rio’s programmes""}",The Guardian
1gvll5t,Rio Tinto employees not happy about gender equality,Ice_Visor,297,177,"Can't say I blame the guys when targets inevitably lead to diversity hires and diversity hires get no respect.

I'm all for hiring more women in male dominated work places, but only if the policy is to get more women to apply thus making it far more likely a woman will be the best applicant. 

If the policy is simply hire more women then if ten people were interviewed for a job,  9 men and one woman,  you already know who's getting the job. You also know there's a good chance she wasn't the best applicant and she will be treated as a diversity hire on site. Unfortunately so will most women,  even though many will be employed because they were the best applicant.  The bulk of the men will just assume a woman is there because of her extra x chromosome and nothing more.

None,Afternoon Update: Trump picks Dr Oz to run Medicare; bullying reports increase at Rio Tinto; and the new word for cost-of-living rage,Australia news,75,None,"Good afternoon. Donald Trump’s picks for his forthcoming second administration have continued to raise eyebrows, with a fresh round of loyalists and controversial media personalities nominated for high-profile positions. Trump has nominated Mehmet Oz, best known globally as Dr Oz , to serve as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator. The failed Senate candidate and TV personality’s medical advice has proved so controversial a 2014 study declared half of it “baseless or wrong”. Linda McMahon, co-chair of Donald Trump’s transition team, has been named as the president-elect’s pick for education secretary. McMahon is a former executive of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. The McMahons were named in a lawsuit in October alleging she and other leaders of the company knew about and failed to stop the sexual abuse of young boys by a ringside announcer. An attorney for the McMahons told USA Today Sports that the allegations are “false claims” stemming from reporting that the couple deems “absurd, defamatory and utterly meritless”. Elsewhere, Trump is reportedly keeping his controversial adviser Kash Patel, who has frequently railed against the “deep state” , in the running to be the next FBI director.

1g5c5pb,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto",Rippedyanu1,74,34,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale.

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company currently has 200 million in liquid cash, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen's (NXE) Arrow deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO) or close to it, specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto which trades at a 110Billion market cap. If UUUU even becomes worth 20% of that which I think is a fair assessment given the above points (I didn't even get into vanadium mineralization) that would be \~120 a share based on the current float. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

1g5c4ap,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto ($RIO)",Rippedyanu1,120,124,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining U stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operation Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If They were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 2, 3 4+ Billion USD per year for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company current has 200 million in liquid cash right now, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States.

None,Rio Tinto to buy US lithium producer Arcadium in $6.7bn deal,Business,89,None,"Rio Tinto is to buy the US company Arcadium Lithium for $6.7bn (?5.1bn), in a huge bet on energy transition despite stalling growth in the electric car market . The deal would make the Anglo-Australian miner one of the largest producers of the battery-making metal, alongside Albemarle and SQM. Rio Tinto said it would pay $5.85 a share for Arcadium – an almost 90% premium on top of the US-based lithium miner’s closing price of $3.08 on 3 October, the day before news of a potential deal emerged. The acquisition would give Rio access to lithium mines, processing facilities and deposits in Argentina, Australia, Canada and the US that are all expected to play a key role in manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and other purposes. It will also hand the world’s second largest miner a customer base that includes the carmakers Tesla, BMW and General Motors. Rio has taken a bet on the long-term future of the lithium market even as prices for the metal have floundered because of Chinese oversupply and a slowdown in EV sales, resulting in lithium miners emerging as attractive takeover targets. Car manufacturers around the world have for months complained of stalling growth in EV demand . Japan’s Toyota said last week it would delay the start of EV production in the US until 2026, after previously suggesting it would begin at the end of 2025. Ford and Volvo are also among companies to have delayed their transition to electric. In the UK, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group, has found that registrations of new EVs grew by just 3.7% in September, compared with a year earlier, while registrations for new diesel cars increased by about 17.2%. Referring to the bid to buy Arcadium, Jakob Stausholm, the chief executive of Rio Tinto, said. “This is a countercyclical expansion aligned with our disciplined capital allocation framework, increasing our exposure to a high-growth, attractive market at the right point in the cycle.” Peter Coleman, the chair of Arcadium, said the cash offer would provide shareholders with “certainty and liquidity” and avoid the risks associated with lithium market fluctuations. Arcadium shares have fallen more than 37% since the start of the year, valuing the company at $4.56bn. Jason Beddow, the managing director of the Australian fund manager Argo Investments, which owns shares in Rio, said the deal made a lot of sense. “Yes, it’s a big premium but stocks have been sold off a lot,” he said. Beddow, who visited the companies’ Canadian operations in recent weeks, said: “They are both close together geographically, they both use Quebec hydropower. Rio has a strong chemicals business in Canada that this will slot into.” The deal, which has been unanimously approved by the companies’ boards, is expected to be completed in mid-2025.

1fjdbbq,Debata o iskopavanju Jadarita-Rio Tinto,RimputapaChimbunaba,34,46,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGOCZKA9oLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGOCZKA9oLg)

Veceras na RTS je bila korisna naucna rasprava u vezi iskopavanja litijuma, dva clana debate su za, a dva protiv rudarenja Jadarita, rekao bih da ovaj jedan (Dejan Ilic) i nije naucnik, ali vredi pogledati.

Za one koji nemaju volje i vremena za to, ukratko cu izneti bitne zakljucke.

Studije i analize koje je iznela kompanija Rio Tinto su Teorijski izvodljive. kada bi stvari gledali teoretski.

Svaki rudnik ima odrdjen uticaj na zivotnu sredinu, samo je pitanje koliko. S obzirom da je Jadar veliki Rudnik,ne kao Bor, ali odredjena kontaminacija bi sigurno postojala. Zbog toga se svi rudnici Litijuma u svetu nalaze u industrijskim zonama i u nenaseljenim mestima, kako bi sve bilo pogodno za eksploataciju.

Dubina na kojoj se nalazi ruda je na 350m do 700m ispod povrsine zemlje, sto je dobro sa ekoloskog aspekta jer se ne radi o povrsinskom kopu.

Litijum se u svetu masovno proizovdi iz minerala spodumena i taj mineral ima istu kolicinu litijuma kao jadarit, s tim sto jadarit ima i natrijum i bor i silicijum, a spodumen se sastoji od litijuma, silicijuma i aluminijuma pa kada se izdvoji Litijum ostaje alumosilikat koji nije opasan po zivotnu sredinu. Tako da bi se morao resavati i problem bora i natrijuma.

Jadarit je i otkriven tako sto se trazio bor, ali trenutno potraznja za borom i bornim jedinjenjima kao prozivodima trenutno nema komercijalnu vrednost, a to potvrdjuje i podatak da Rio Tinto u rudnicima u Kaliforniji poseduje rezerve Bora koji je ostao u otpadu.

Na sadasnjem nivou razvoja tehnologije jos nije izveden proces razdvajanja litijuma od bora bez velike kolicine bora kao otpada i to bi bio novi tehnoloski proces koja se planira u Jadru. 

Kolicina Sumporne kiseline da bi se razlozio Jadarit je 943tona dnevno, koje bi se dovozile u Jadar narednih 10000dana, koliko iznosi period eksploatacije litijuma u Jadru.

Jedne od najvecih rezervi pijacih podzemnih voda se nalaze u Macvi, na 15km od rudnika, postoje brojni rizici kontaminacije tih voda, mogucnost poplava,stvaranja pukotina u vodonepropusnim stenama usled sleganja tla. Rio Tinto je u svojoj studiji naveo da ce ceo rudnik biti podignut iznad nivoa poplavnog talasa iz 2014. godine tako sto ce podici ceo plato rudnika za 4m na POVRSINI OD 220 HEKTARA. Kako?

Odluka ce na kraju biti politicka.",2024/9/18 8:44,Accountability|Execution|Performance,Risk & Regulatory Management|Infrastructure & Maintenance|Market Performance & Competitiveness,"{""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""negative"", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""negative""}",0.7,{},Reddit

None,Activist opposed to Rio Tinto lithium mine receives anonymous death threats,Business,66,None,"When Aleksandar Matkovi? received the first message threatening his life, he thought it was a prank. The text, sent to his Telegram account just after midnight on 14 August read: “We will follow you until you disappear, scum.” Matkovi? is one of the campaigners who have been at the forefront of widespread protests against plans to develop a massive lithium mine in Serbia. He said: “At first I thought someone was joking but during the morning I got another message, saying ‘how is the struggle against Rio Tinto going?’ from another profile I didn’t know, and the app displayed the sender’s distance as just 500 [metres] away.” Matkovi? lives in Belgrade, but was in Split visiting a friend, which suggested to him that he was being followed. The reference to Rio Tinto, whose planned $2.4bn lithium mine in Serbia’s Jadar valley had sparked huge protests four days before, only heightened his sense of alarm. “When I saw the distance, I was like, ‘what the hell is going on?’ The idea that someone might be following me was creepy, so I contacted my lawyer and about an hour later I received a third message. This time it was super-serious.” The third message, written in garbled German, said: “We know about your relationship with the leaders of the revolt. We know that everything originates from you. Even if you behave notoriously and then disappear somewhere, we will follow you. We will track you and you can’t even ask the police for help because you know full well you can’t, believe me. Stay out of the public light for a while if you want to keep writing and breathing. Behave impeccably on social media. You must understand that you need to be afraid for yourself and for your little brother.” At that point Matkovi? reported the threats to the Belgrade police, who are now investigating, according to correspondence seen by the Guardian along with the menacing texts. The fast-moving issues in play are complex, and have implications stretching far beyond the Belgrade public prosecutors’ office. The campaign against lithium mines in Serbia has become a lightning rod for social grievances, mobilising tens of thousands of people for several years, including ultra-nationalists angry about economic integration with the west, environmentalists, leftists, and villagers fearful that their groundwater will be poisoned . Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vu?i?, warned last week that this opposition force was plotting a Balkan “colour revolution”. The former Yugoslav nation has vast deposits of lithium, which are critical for the batteries used to power electric vehicles. The EU this year moved to ensure that at least 10% of the critical minerals, such as lithium, it needs are extracted in Europe by 2030 . Julia Poliscanova, vehicles and supply chains director of the thinktank Transport and Environment, said lithium was essential for powering transport electrification in Europe. “However, it is important that this lithium comes from a diverse and, above all, sustainable and responsibly sourced supply chain. Serbia can be such a partner for Europe. But the current politicisation of the planned mine is unhelpful.” Last month a Serbian constitutional court overturned a previous ruling which had blocked the Jadar mining project. Within days the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited Belgrade to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Serbian government on behalf of the EU to bring the country’s critical raw materials into Europe’s supply chain. Matkovi?, a green activist who co-drafted the Jadar declaration against lithium exploitation, says such agreements will tie Serbia into a “neocolonial” relationship with Europe. A few days before the death threats he received he published an open letter in the opposition Danas newspaper arguing for alternative forms of green transport. He said: “The entire public discourse is that electric vehicles are a magic bullet which will solve climate change, but that’s not exactly true. We need more investment in public transport and infrastructure first. Then if you want to stick to electric vehicles you can use alternatives like sodium-ion batteries and hydrogen batteries.” For its part, Rio Tinto condemned any threats of violence against Matkovi?. A company statement said: “Rio Tinto strongly condemns any direct or implied threat of violence, online or elsewhere, against those participating in the debate about the Jadar project.” The statement from Rio Tinto, a British-Australian multinational, said the company “also condemns in the strongest terms the intimidation and threats that our employees and their families in Serbia have faced”. Rio Tinto employees had suffered physical threats online and when protesters picketed a community meeting, a spokesperson said. Matkovi? is taking no chances. Following a further slew of text threats that have left him unable to sleep he has taken steps to protect his security and that of his family, including, potentially, seeking protection in another European country’s embassy in Belgrade. He will also be requesting intervention from the UN special rapporteur on environmental defenders. “Since 14 August my days have been a volatile mix of routine and complete chaos,” he said. “How it can be that any of this is part and parcel of our climate change mitigation strategy? What sort of a green transition is it that we want if we have to kill people to achieve it?”",2024/8/22 16:00,Well-being|Accountability,Special Group Safety & Care|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Special Group Safety & Care"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""positive""}",0.88,"{""Special Group Safety & Care"": ""Activist opposed to Rio Tinto lithium mine receives anonymous death threats"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""A company statement said: “Rio Tinto strongly condemns any direct or implied threat of violence, online or elsewhere, against those participating in the debate about the Jadar project.”""}",The Guardian

The deposits were discovered in 2004, but weeks of mass protests forced the government to halt the project in 2022.

But the government recently made a U-turn on the issue following a court decision last month that said the order to revoke the permits awarded to Rio Tinto was “not in line with the constitution and the law”.

None,Traditional owners left to ‘pick up the pieces’ after sacred rock shelter damaged in Rio Tinto blast,Australia news,73,None,"Traditional owners say they are being left to “pick up the pieces” in Western Australia’s remote Pilbara region after mining company Rio Tinto damaged a rock shelter sacred to the Muntulgura Guruma people. Rio Tinto discovered the disturbance near its Nammuldi iron ore mine, about 60km from Tom Price last month during its cultural heritage monitoring. The company said in a statement that during the survey it identified the fall of a Pilbara scrub tree and a 1 sq metre rock from the overhang of a rock shelter in an area adjacent to the mine site. It said it halted works and alerted traditional owners to the incident. Related: New Aboriginal cultural heritage laws in WA hope to take state from ‘wild west’ to a better way “As soon as we identified this, we paused nearby blasting work, which was occurring 150 metres away, and notified the traditional owners of the land, the Muntulgura Guruma people,” the statement said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Aaron Rayner, the chief operating officer of the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC), which represents the Muntulgura Guruma people, said the full extent of the incident was not yet known and that any impact was “unwelcome”. “WGAC is aware of the reported impacts to the rock shelter site on Muntulgura Guruma country in the Hamersley Ranges,” he said. “Regrettably, it seems as though Rio’s blast management plan has failed on this occasion, leaving the Muntulgura Guruma people to pick up the pieces.” Rayner said traditional owners would work with the mining company to assess the full impact and would also be independently verifying the report in the future. “We will work with Rio Tinto to better understand what has happened and will work to independently establish the facts in the coming weeks,” he said. Rayner said he was unable to confirm if the reported impact to the rock shelter was due to blast activity or whether the company had prior approvals under any existing state legislation. Rio Tinto was widely condemned after it legally destroyed 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge under Western Australia’s half-century-old cultural heritage protection laws with ministerial consent, despite it being a recognised sacred site. The outcry triggered a federal parliamentary inquiry examining the laws protecting culturally significant sites and spurred the government to update the state’s Aboriginal cultural heritage protection laws. Despite stakeholder consultation, including with miners, farmers and pastoralists, as well as Indigenous groups, and the government initially standing by the laws, they were only in place for five weeks. The government scrapped the laws after strong criticism and is consulting with community and stakeholders to modernise the 1972 legislation. In a statement, Rio Tinto said initial drone assessments have not found structural damage to the rock shelter or impacts to any cultural materials and has apologised over the incident. “We are working closely with the Muntulgura Guruma people to better understand what has happened and will be guided by them on the appropriate next steps,” the statement said. “We deeply respect the Muntulgura Guruma people.”",2023/9/25 17:50,Accountability|Integrity|Collaboration,Transparency & Disclosure|Ethics & Compliance|Team Collaboration & Communication|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Community & Organizational Cooperation,"{""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""positive"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Community & Organizational Cooperation"": ""positive""}",1,"{""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""the full extent of the incident was not yet known"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""whether the company had prior approvals under any existing state legislation"", ""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""alerted traditional owners"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""the company had prior approvals"", ""Community & Organizational Cooperation"": ""work with the mining company to assess the full impact""}",The Guardian

None,Troy Johnston death: Indonesian man arrested after Australian Rio Tinto worker dies in Bali bar,World news,66,None,"An Indonesian man has been arrested and police say will be charged with murder after the death of an Australian man in a Bali bar. Local media reported that on Wednesday night Perth man Troy Johnston, 40, was drinking at Uncle Benz cafe in South Kuta. The Bali Sun reported the head of public relations of the Bali police, Stefanus Satakake Bayu Setianto, said that Johnston had been in an altercation with an Indonesian man. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The man, Gede Wijaya, reportedly owned the cafe where Johnston was drinking. “The perpetrator and the victim [started] drinking alcohol at 7.30pm. Shortly thereafter, the victim got drunk and hit the perpetrator,” Setianto said. “Before hitting the victim using a chair, the victim first threatened the perpetrator. “Seeing the victim lift a chair, the perpetrator reflexively lifted the chair and hit the victim’s head many times at once.” Wijaya reportedly gave a similar account of the altercation during a press conference at the South Kuta police station on Friday. Police told the press conference he would be charged with murder. Police believe the pair had met several days before the altercation and that Johnston had been staying with his wife at a villa nearby. Johnston, reportedly a father of one, worked for mining company Rio Tinto, which has confirmed his death and expressed their sympathy for his family and friends. “We are devastated by the news that one of our much loved and valued team members has tragically passed away overseas,” the company said in a statement. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Troy’s family and friends, and we are providing them all the support we can during this very difficult time. “Troy’s colleagues are deeply saddened and we are providing them access to a range of support services.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said consular assistance was being provided to the Australian’s family. ?

None,Anthony Albanese rejects reports of $450m coal price cap payout for Rio Tinto and partners,Australia news,92,None,"Anthony Albanese has rejected suggestions of a potential $450m payout to Rio Tinto and its partners for the Gladstone power plant , which could push coal price cap compensation to more than $1bn. Albanese told Channel Seven’s Sunrise the federal government expects the cost “will be nothing like the sort of figures” reported for Gladstone although Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk later appeared to confirm the figure was possible, as a maximum. Earlier in December the Albanese government legislated a temporary price cap of $12 a gigajoule for gas and $125 a tonne for coal, as part of a package including $1.5bn in electricity price relief . In order to encourage continued supply, where coal power producers have actual costs exceeding the $125 price cap – such as pre-existing supply contracts for more expensive coal – the federal and state governments agreed to provide them a rebate. Related: Rio Tinto and partners could receive as much as $450m in government compensation for coal price cap On Wednesday the Australian newspaper reported that Rio Tinto and its partners could receive up to $450m for its Gladstone plant, which has supplied the domestic grid since an explosion at the state-owned Callide power plant in May 2021 . A Queensland government source told Guardian Australia the $450m figure would be “in the ballpark”, although state generators returning in May should limit Rio’s compensation to six months. The $450m price tag prompted a backlash from the Greens, with the leader, Adam Bandt, saying “not a single dollar of public money” should go to coal and gas corporations, and from independent senator David Pocock, who said if the figure was correct, “the payment for just one generator could be worth almost a third of the total support provided to consumers.” “The briefings and information I received suggested that any compensation under this plan to bring much-needed energy price relief for households and small businesses would be minimal and confined to a small number of generators,” Pocock reportedly said. “This raises serious concerns about the total amount of compensation to be paid.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Asked about the reported payout on Thursday, Albanese said: “No, those reports are just that, they are reports. I notice there’s no government ministers quoted, there’s not even the company quoted at all.” “What we have said is that where the price of production is more than the cap, then there will be some support offered. “In Queensland’s case, which is what the report’s about, there’s only one power station, Gladstone. We expect that it will be nothing like the sort of figures that I’ve seen in the newspaper.” But Palaszczuk appeared to confirm the figure, responding “yes, we did know” compensation for Gladstone could be “up to $450m” when asked on Thursday. “All of that was worked out when we reached the agreement we reached,” she told reporters. Federal government sources said they still expect the total price of compensation to be between $500m and $1bn, figures Guardian Australia reported in mid-December based on a Treasury briefing that included estimates of $250m for New South Wales producers. The rate of compensation is being determined by a reconciliation of electricity producers’ actual costs with the $125 cap, made more difficult by the fact costs can vary with a combination of coal at a pre-contracted price or from the spot market. Related: Fossil fuel interests revealed to have sponsored more than 500 Australian community organisations Rio Tinto, the major partner in the Gladstone plant, is also the generator’s major customer. “That makes for some funny incentives when it comes to Gladstone,” the Queensland source said. Albanese said the payouts are “the subject of commercial discussions and they’ll continue”. “Where the costs of production are more than [$125], going to the power stations, then there will be some level of compensation,” he said. Albanese said he had “no idea” where the $450m compensation figure came from, suggesting his office had been asked about “a much higher figure even than that” before the report. The Grattan Institute’s energy program director, Tony Wood, said he is “generally supportive of the fact the government intervened” but observed that “when you intervene in complex markets, there will be unintended consequences”. Wood noted compensation is not being paid to coalminers or gas producers, and it would be “wrong” to criticise the package on that basis. “The government had a choice: to effectively override the [electricity supply] contracts, to force [coal plants] to … provide electricity at $125 a tonne; or they could provide compensation to the generator,” he said. “It’s not compensation to coal companies for losing windfall profits – it’s for generators locked into supply contracts.”",2022/12/29 16:38,Accountability|Respect|Execution|Performance,Policy & Government Relations|Recognition & Appreciation|Cost Management & Resource Efficiency|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators,"{""Policy & Government Relations"": ""positive"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""negative"", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""positive""}",0.83,"{""Policy & Government Relations"": ""Albanese told Channel Seven’s Sunrise the federal government expects the cost “will be nothing like the sort of figures” reported for Gladstone"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""$450m in government compensation for coal price cap"", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""total price of compensation to be between $500m and $1bn"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""prompted a backlash from the Greens, with the leader, Adam Bandt, saying “not a single dollar of public money” should go to coal and gas corporations"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""where coal power producers have actual costs exceeding the $125 price cap – such as pre-existing supply contracts for more expensive coal – the federal and state governments agreed to provide them a r""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto and partners could receive as much as $450m in government compensation for coal price cap,Australia news,75,None,"Compensation payments for the Gladstone power plant remain the sticking point in the federal government’s coal price cap compensation negotiations with Queensland. The Australian newspaper reported the owners of the central Queensland power plant, Rio Tinto and its partners, are set to receive up to $450m in compensation for the temporary price cap of $125 a tonne that was put in place to drive down power price increases. Queensland and the federal government will split the compensation costs under the agreement, which was struck at national cabinet earlier this month. Negotiations are ongoing, but a Queensland government source said $450m would be “in the ballpark”. The Gladstone plant is one of just two generators owned by the private market and its main purpose was generating power for Rio’s aluminium smelter, also located in Gladstone. The Prime Minister, Government ministers, Teal independents and the Greens are all strangely silent on this story today - despite voting for and endorsing the government’s rushed legislation less than two weeks ago. pic.twitter.com/jjHVTzaaAS — Peter Dutton (@PeterDutton_MP) December 28, 2022 An explosion at the state-owned Callide power plant in May 2021 destroyed one of its generators and damaged another, leaving a shortfall in the generation market that the Gladstone plant stepped in to help fill. It has been selling power to the domestic grid since. Rio Tinto, the major partner in the plant, is also the generator’s major customer. “That makes for some funny incentives when it comes to Gladstone,” the Queensland source said. The Greens supported the federal government’s energy bill earlier this month, but had drawn a hard line at fossil fuel companies receiving compensation. Adam Bandt said his party would oppose any future legislation which would allow that element. Related: What is the energy price relief plan and will it actually reduce power bills? “In a cost of living crisis, Labor should be helping people, not big corporations,” Bandt said. “This money could be used to stop people’s power bills rising at all, and then recouped by a windfall tax on coal and gas corporations. “Not a single dollar of public money should go to [them]. “Labor must come clean about how much public money they are giving to coal and gas corporations.” The Coalition opposed the energy bill. On Wednesday, Peter Dutton made his views known on social media. “Seriously $450m of borrowed money given to a profitable mining company. Just the latest instalment in economic idiocy from the Albanese Government,” he said. The compensation payments for Rio Tinto and its partners for the Gladstone generation are not expected to continue for the year the price cap is in place, with the damaged Callide generators forecast to return online in May 2023. The mining lobby has reacted furiously to Queensland increasing its coal royalty payments at the same time as supporting the coal price cap, with the minerals lobby threatening to run a campaign against the government’s royalty changes in the lead up to the 2024 election. The federal government is also facing industry backlash against the temporary price caps, particularly from the gas industry, which will be limited to $12 a gigajoule when selling to the domestic market. The price cap came into effect earlier this month.

None,Directors of firm responsible for clean-up at Kakadu uranium site will resign amid fight with Rio Tinto,Business,82,None,"The directors of the company that owns the Jabiluka and Ranger uranium deposits at Kakadu, Energy Resources Australia, who aren’t affiliated with majority shareholder Rio Tinto say they will resign amid a fight over whether there should be mining at the site. It came after Rio Tinto dramatically escalated its war with minority shareholders in ERA on Monday by calling on the company’s chair, Peter Mansell, to resign. Rio, which owns 86% of ERA, has pledged to rehabilitate the tapped-out Ranger open-cut mine and says it will not dig for uranium at Jabiluka as long as its traditional owners, the Mirarr people, maintain their long-held opposition to the mine. However, minority shareholders in ERA want the company to develop the Jabiluka deposit and look into re-starting a project to mine deep below the Ranger pit. Following Rio’s call, ERA said Mansell, together with independent directors Paul Dowd and Shane Charles, told Rio they intended to resign as soon as “a clear pathway to an interim funding solution for the company is arrived at”. The stoush has thrown into limbo efforts to raise up to $2.2bn needed for the remediation of Ranger – work that is already suffering from large cost blowouts and lengthy delays. It boiled over last week when a valuation report, commissioned from accounting firm Grant Thornton by non-Rio members of ERA’s board, canvassed the possibility of developing Jabiluka and said there might be some value in Ranger 3 Deeps, a deposit below Ranger that ERA has previously looked at but decided would not be economic to mine. On Monday, Rio said it had requested Mansell resign “to allow for board renewal and introduce new perspectives to address the material cost and schedule overruns on the critical Ranger rehabilitation project in Australia’s Northern Territory”. Related: Kakadu uranium site clean-up in limbo amid calls to revive mine Rio’s chief executive for Australia, Kellie Parker, said the company was committed to rehabilitating the Ranger area “in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr people”. “However, given our recent dealings with the IBC [independent board committee] and last week’s release of the Grant Thornton valuation report, we do not believe that can be achieved without renewal within ERA’s board,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We thank Peter Mansell for his contribution to ERA over many years and acknowledge his efforts to find a funding solution. “However, there remains a strong difference of opinion between Rio Tinto and the IBC on the terms of rehabilitation funding, with the IBC’s view that successful rehabilitation could underpin potential future growth opportunities, despite the Mirarr people’s long-held opposition to further uranium mining on their country.” “We look forward to working with ERA to facilitate board renewal and urgently develop a workable plan to fund the increased rehabilitation costs.” ERA said Rio was aware that Mansell, Dowd and Charles were intending to resign before publicly calling for Mansell’s head on Monday morning. The company also complained that media coverage of the stoush, including by Guardian Australia, “contains factual inaccuracies” that included implying that ERA would develop Jabiluka without the consent of the Mirrar people. One of the key minority shareholders, Richard Magides of Zentree Investments, accused Rio of “bully-like behaviour to directors and minorities”. “They call all the shots, but, it seems, if directors try to fulfil their fiduciary responsibility to ALL shareholders and not just execute Rio’s ‘suggestions’, Rio may pressurise them to leave,” Magides told Guardian Australia. Another key minority shareholder, Willy Packer of Packer & Co, said that “the independent board members of ERA, who were originally appointed by Rio Tinto, have been persecuted and oppressed by Rio to the point they all want to quit, leaving Rio employees as the only members of the ERA board”. “Rio is blaming ERA’s independent directors for the rehabilitation cost blowout even though Rio employees have run ERA’s operations for 20 years. A disingenuous claim. “Clearly the reason Rio’s senior executives are fuming is that the ERA independent directors are not toeing the line but are acting independently.” Justin O’Brien, the chief executive of the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the Mirarr, called on the Albanese government to step in urgently to “secure the integrity of Kakadu National Park”. “This public stoush over whether or not ‘magical’ uranium deposits in a World Heritage listed wetland and indigenous cultural landscape should be mined is a question of national public policy,” he said. “One thing has been made very obvious in this – company directors, speculative investors and valuers cannot and will not make balanced and sensible decisions affecting our national cultural heritage,” he said. “They will be motivated by financial return alone rather than the totality of our public interest. This is the lesson we should have learned from the Juukan Gorge inquiry.” Grant Thornton has defended its work, last week telling Guardian Australia that it had followed the law in preparing the valuation report. “The opposition of the traditional owners to the development of the Jabiluka site is extensively acknowledged and documented in the report,” a spokesperson for the firm said. “Our report does not suggest the traditional owners will change their view or would provide approval.”",2022/10/3 11:51,Integrity|Accountability,Ethics & Compliance|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Ethics & Compliance"": ""Rio is blaming ERA’s independent directors for the rehabilitation cost blowout even though Rio employees have run ERA’s operations for 20 years.

None,"Russian aluminium giant cut out of Queensland operation to abide by sanctions, Rio Tinto says",Business,79,None,"Rio Tinto says it would have breached sanctions and illegally increased the wealth of two Russian oligarchs if it had not taken the dramatic step of cutting a Russian corporate giant out of a major Queensland alumina operation. The Australian government’s sanctions against Russian billionaires Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, both allies of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, prompted a swift response from the Australian mining giant earlier this year. Both Vekselberg and Deripaska hold interests in Rusal, the Russian aluminium giant, which partnered with Rio Tinto to operate an alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland; Rio Tinto is a major employer in the region and a significant contributor to the state’s economy. Related: Australian government extends sanctions to Russian oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg Fearing the arrangement would put it in breach of the Australian sanctions, Rio Tinto froze out Rusal’s subsidiary – a British Virgin Islands-based company named Alumina and Bauxite Company (ABC) – from the Gladstone operation. The move triggered a lawsuit from Rusal’s subsidiary, which asked the federal court to restore its rights and privileges under the joint venture deal. It told the court it had “ringfenced” its operations to ensure that Deripaska and Vekselberg did not stand to benefit from ABC. It also said it told Rio Tinto that it would “not supply or sell alumina to the Russian Federation” and was “not taxable in the Russian Federation”. “In these circumstances ABC is not subject to the Personal Sanctions or the Export Sanctions,” the company said in its court filing. The deal between Rusal and Rio Tinto saw the Gladstone refinery used to process bauxite into alumina. Rusal’s subsidiary delivered about 20% of the bauxite the refinery needs to make alumina, and the Russian operation got an equal share of the alumina output in return, which it then sells. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a defence filed earlier this month, Rio Tinto alleged that, if that arrangement had continued, it would “have made the Gladstone plant directly or indirectly available for the benefit of Mr Deripaska and Mr Vekselberg”. “By the Gladstone Plant’s use, alumina would have been able to be produced and traded which would enhance the value of Mr Deripaska and Mr Vekselberg’s interests in ABC, Mr Deripaska’s blocked account … and/or Mr Vekselberg’s interest in the trust arrangement,” the company’s defence said. “If [the joint venture company] loaded shipments for ABC of alumina that had been processed at the Gladstone Plant, it would have made alumina directly or indirectly available for the benefit of Mr Deripaska and Mr Vekselberg.” Rio Tinto used a “trigger” related to sanctions, contained in its joint venture agreement with Rusal, to freeze the company out of the Gladstone refinery operation. In court documents, the Rusal subsidiary said the trigger’s use was “invalid”, because the activities of Rusal, ABC and their affiliates were not directly affected by the sanctions. The company also said it had no plan to make assets “directly or indirectly” available to Deripaska or Vekselberg. “Neither person will receive any dividend or right to a dividend from ABC in respect of ABC’s operations, and the revenue that ABC receives from supplying alumina to ABC will be received by ABC alone,” it said.

None,Rio Tinto agrees to pay additional $613m to settle dispute with Australian tax office,Australia news,81,None,"Rio Tinto has agreed to pay the Australian taxation office an additional $613m to settle disputes over its financing arrangements and marketing hubs in Singapore, as part of what the ATO claims is one of the biggest tax settlements in Australian history. The payment is on top of $378m the global mining giant had previously paid over the same dispute,bringing the total to almost $1bn in extra tax revenue. The ATO had been seeking about $1.2bn in tax and penalties. Tax arrangements for the next five years were also locked in as part of the deal. Related: Household names: 168 Australian companies have paid no tax since 2013 Rebecca Saint, an ATO deputy commissioner, said the settlement was “a very good outcome for the Australian tax system”. “This means that additional profits from the sale of Rio’s Australian-owned commodities will be taxed in Australia in the years to come,” she said. “The resolution of these matters means that ordinary Australians can have confidence that even the biggest companies are held to account to pay their tax due.” Starting in 2017, the ATO hit Rio Tinto with a series of large tax bills over its marketing hub in Singapore, which sells iron ore and aluminium on behalf of the group. The bills date back to 2010. Similar hubs are used by BHP and other miners, but their use became controversial in Australia in the mid-2010s amid a general crackdown by the ATO on multinational corporations. The ATO also pursued Rio Tinto in 2021 over money it borrowed within the group to pay a dividend to shareholders in 2015.

None,Subsidiary of Russian company sues Rio Tinto for cutting it out of Queensland alumina operation,Business,86,None,"A subsidiary of Russian aluminium giant Rusal is suing Rio Tinto for freezing it out of a Queensland alumina operation due to Australian sanctions, saying it had deliberately “ringfenced” its business to avoid any benefit from flowing to targeted oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In March, the Australian government announced it would impose sanctions on Deripaska, a Russian metals magnate, due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Deripaska holds a 25.6% stake in Rusal, which partnered with Rio Tinto to operate an alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland, through a joint venture known as Queensland Alumina Ltd. Related: Australian man killed in Ukraine while providing humanitarian aid The move left Rio Tinto scrambling to understand its legal obligations, including how it would affect its work with one of Rusal’s subsidiaries, a company based in the British Virgin Islands named the Alumina and Bauxite Company (ABC). ABC’s role in the joint venture is to deliver about 20% of the bauxite the refinery needs to make alumina. It gets an equal share of the alumina output in return, which it then sells. The joint venture company decided it would be in breach of the Australian sanctions should it continue the deal with ABC. In April, Rio Tinto announced it would take 100% responsibility for the operation and governance of the Gladstone refinery to ensure sanctions were not breached. ABC has sued Rio Tinto, asking the federal court to restore its rights and privileges under the joint venture deal, stop Rio Tinto from taking any further steps, and award it damages, interest and court costs. Court documents, first reported by the Australian Financial Review , show the Rusal subsidiary told Rio Tinto that its business was “‘ringfenced’ such that Mr Deripaska does not stand to receive any benefit from ABC’s business operations”. It also said it told Rio Tinto that it would “not supply or sell alumina to the Russian Federation” and was “not taxable in the Russian Federation”. “In these circumstances ABC is not subject to the Personal Sanctions or the Export Sanctions,” the company said in its court filing.

None,Juukan Gorge traditional owners sign agreement with Rio Tinto to co-manage WA mining land,Australia news,73,None,"The traditional owners of Juukan Gorge have signed a preliminary agreement with Rio Tinto to co-manage land that is still being mined for iron ore. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people said the mining giant broke their trust with the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site , which was blown up by Rio Tinto in May 2020 in an effort to access more high-grade iron ore at its Brockman 4 mine. The traditional owners have demanded they be given a co-management role in determining the future of mines that fall within their native title area, which covers 10,888 sq km between Onslow and Tom Price in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Related: A year on from the Juukan Gorge destruction, Aboriginal sacred sites remain unprotected The chair of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, Burchall Hayes, said the signing of a new heads of agreement this week was the first step in rebuilding that relationship. It outlines principles of co-management of Aboriginal heritage sites that fall within Rio’s mining leases on PKKP lands, including greater involvement by the PKKP on mining activities on their land and clear identification of which PKKP people speak for which area. “This agreement provides clear acknowledgment that Rio Tinto accepts that the destruction of the rock shelters should not have happened and makes clear that it is absolutely committed to listening, learning, changing and co-managing country,” Hayes said in a statement on Friday. “While the agreement is non-binding, we believe it is a clear signal of intent from Rio Tinto and one that will ultimately be tested in the co-management agreement that is reached.” Rio Tinto’s iron ore chief executive, Simon Trott, said the company “continues to reflect on the loss and hurt that we caused at Juukan Gorge which was a clear breach of our values”. “ The PKKP people have graciously shared their knowledge to help inform our approach to best practice management and protection of cultural heritage as well as how we can deliver better social and economic outcomes on the ground,” Trott said. “Our discussions on these matters continue as we work to create a shared future.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The global investor fallout from destroying the shelters led to Rio placing a moratorium on mining within 10 sq km around the site , the value of which dwarfed that of the eight tonnes of high-grade ore accessed by destroying the heritage site.

None,Rio Tinto warns Australia’s slow renewable energy rollout threatens fossil fuel phase out,Business,89,None,"Australia needs to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy, the chief executive of the country’s second-biggest mining company, Rio Tinto, has said. “We’re just not developing renewable energy fast enough,” Jakob Stausholm said, speaking after Rio’s annual shareholder meeting in Melbourne.

Related: Rio Tinto investor votes against financial statements in climate protest Stausholm said Rio had to focus on where it was getting energy from in the short term or it would be “creating problems” for itself. “We need energy,” he said. “If renewable energy goes slow, we cannot phase out fossil fuel.” Rio’s new chairperson, Dominic Barton, warned shareholders that an economic fissure between China and the west, similar to that which opened up with Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, was unlikely but would have horrendous consequences. Speaking at Rio’s annual meeting on Thursday, Barton said that the relationship with China, the company’s biggest customer and Australia’s no 1 export market for iron ore, was important. China has previously blocked Australian coal imports over the country’s support of US foreign policy. “If the world ever got to that point, if you think about the integration of the Chinese economy with the world economy, we are in a devastating situation,” he said. “The entire integration of the economies between China and the rest of the world is so deep, it is so completely different than Russia … I think it would be horrendous.” Stausholm told investors he is trying to reset the company’s culture after a disastrous two-year period that included blowing up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, stoushes with governments in Mongolia and Serbia and the exposure of a culture of racism, sexism and bullying within the global miner. The Juukan Gorge debacle cost his predecessor, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, his job and also led to the exit of much of the company’s top executive team. However, Rio Tinto remains financially strong, declaring record profits and dividends off the back of an iron price that remains extremely high. Stausholm again apologised to Rio workers who have been bullied or the victim of racism and sexism in the organisation – deep cultural failings that were laid bare in a report by the former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick , released in February. “With the executive team’s commitment, we can make a positive and lasting change and make Rio Tinto a less hierarchical, more humane place to work,” he said. The outgoing chairperson, Simon Thompson, who retired at the end of the shareholder meeting, said that climate change was “the defining issue for our age, and is at the heart of our new strategy”. He said the company had a “critical role” in the transition away from fossil fuels by supplying the copper, lithium, iron ore and aluminium needed to build renewable energy plants. “With our suppliers, I think we do have very significant influence because frankly, they want our money,” he said. “We can, for example, say to Caterpillar and Komatsu that we’re not going to buy diesel trucks beyond 2030.” Thompson said it was much harder to influence scope three emissions – those put out by Rio’s customers. Rio has released modelling on how the steel industry can decarbonise and hopes to have similar work done on the aluminium business, which is a heavy user of electricity, by the time of next year’s AGM. “The reason that we have not set quantifiable targets for scope three is because we cannot control the pace at which our customers, the steel mills, decarbonise their operations,” he said. “If we were to put targets out there, that to me would be close to lying, it would be greenwashing, because we would be setting hard quantifiable targets for something we don’t control.” “Far from rhetoric and lying we are being very transparent, very honest about what we can do and we are setting very ambitious targets.” Stausholm agreed with a questioner who said Rio should already have had in place a workplace culture where people behaved respectfully towards each other. He said Rio management had not previously fully understood what was happening in the organisation.

On Russia, Thompson said Rio would probably benefit if Rusal, its joint venture partner in a alumina refinery at Gladstone, in Queensland, was sanctioned over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rio has taken full control of the company that runs the refinery, Queensland Alumina Ltd, after Australia slapped sanctions on key Rusal shareholders Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg. “If Rusal was to be sanctioned, that would certainly cause pretty significant disruption in the market because Rusal is a very big supplier of aluminium, particularly in Europe,” he said. “I actually think the impact on Rio Tinto would probably be positive in the sense that the aluminium price would likely go up.”",2022/5/5 14:49,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""slow renewable energy rollout threatens fossil fuel phase out"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""cost his predecessor, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, his job"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""we are being very transparent, very honest about what we can do""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto investor votes against financial statements in climate protest,Business,78,None,"A Rio Tinto investor has voted against the company’s financial statements over a lack of clarity about climate change risks at the mining giant’s London annual general meeting. Ahead of the vote, investment management firm Sarasin & Partners declared its intention to vote against the company’s financial statements, against keeping accounting firm KPMG on as auditor and questioned the performance of the company’s audit committee. A note from the firm’s head of stewardship, Natasha Landell-Mills, said Rio Tinto had not disclosed key material about how it would transition to a zero carbon economy. “While Rio has increased its discussion of climate risks and made clear that its accounts are not 1.5C aligned, thereby providing welcome transparency, it does not provide disclosures on its quantitative assumptions, or visibility as to how it would be impacted if its own stated goal to be 1.5C-aligned were achieved,” Landell-Mills said. The note did not say the firm was voting against the company’s climate statement. Auditors are essential to making investment decisions and any failure to identify, discuss and disclose whether a company is able to meet its climate commitments, and the risk of stranded assets, means investors will be left on the hook. Related: WA Aboriginal site near Rio Tinto mine more than 50,000 years old, new study reveals Rio Tinto’s largest source of carbon emissions are scope 3 emissions – the emissions created by assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisations. As the smelters responsible for turning its iron ore into steel operate in China, Japan and South Korea, and are not owned by the company, the mining giant has so far resisted placing a target on scope 3 emissions. But investors have been increasingly putting pressure on the company to act. An assessment by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) of Rio Tinto’s climate statement found that despite progress elsewhere, the company was not doing enough these emissions. It also found Rio Tinto maintained memberships in industry associations that lobbied against climate action. Dan Gocher, ACCR director of climate and environment, said that as the company does not individually disclose the voting numbers from its London and Australian AGMs, it was difficult to tell the exact level of opposition. “There’s likely to have been some investor opposition to Rio Tinto’s climate report overnight primarily because Rio has not set targets for scope 3 emissions, which it has resisted for many years,” Gocher said. “It did, however, make very significant commitments at the end of 2021 to reduce its operational emissions and allocated significant capital expenditure to achieve that.” Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia, said it was “absolutely wild” that how investors voted was not publicly disclosed. “Transparency is critical,” Walker said. “There should be an open record on who votes on what at AGM and shareholder meetings so we can hold investors to account for their climate commitments.” Walker said this year would mark a test for investors and auditing firms about how genuine they are in their commitment to assessing climate risk and acting to mitigate it. Following investor discontent in the UK, he said Rio Tinto was on notice ahead of its general meeting in a month – along with the rest of corporate Australia. He said that a vote scheduled in two months by AGL seeking permission from its shareholders to split its coal assets into a separate company was a critical moment for firms that have signed up to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. “We’ve seen a lot of nice statements, but this is where the rubber hits the road,” Walker said. “It’s a real big test for these investors and their auditors over their climate commitments. “Our view is they shouldn’t let the demerger proceed because they want to keep burning coal to 2045.” Rio Tinto was contacted for comment. ?

None,"WA Aboriginal site near Rio Tinto mine more than 50,000 years old, new study reveals",Australia news,83,None,"An Aboriginal sacred place located 65 metres from a land bridge used by Rio Tinto to haul iron ore is at least 50,000 years old, with new research finding evidence of occupation during the height of the last ice age. The mining giant, which funded the latest excavation, has promised to ensure the site “is preserved for future generations”. Archaeological exploration at the site, known as Yirra by the Yinhawangka traditional owners, has yielded stone tools, charcoal and bone which show a 50,000-plus year habitation, making it one of the oldest sites yet found in Australia. Related: Gomeroi traditional owners vote against agreement with Santos for Narrabri gas project The research is the first traditional owner-led, non-mining related, heritage excavation on Yinhawangka country, and the first time Rio Tinto has participated in such exploration. The initiative is part of the company’s efforts to improve its relationships with traditional owner groups in the wake of the Juukan Gorge disaster, when the iron ore giant destroyed a 46,000 year old rock shelter against the consent of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners. A subsequent 2021 federal parliamentary inquiry heard that archaeological work was usually perfunctory, and only done as part of a mining company’s application to destroy Aboriginal heritage sites under Western Australia’s previous heritage laws. Heritage experts told the inquiry that very few sites were studied in detail before the sign-off to destroy was given. The work at Yirra marks a significant departure from that practice. Yinhawangka people told the Juukan Gorge inquiry they were concerned for the integrity of Yirra, which was recorded in the WA heritage system but was not a registered site and therefore “unprotected”. The traditional owners said Yirra was very close to a “massive” (110-metre high) land bridge that haul pack trucks used to deliver ore from the mine pit. They said large boulders had rolled onto the site and there was significant soil erosion. Rio Tinto’s cultural heritage management plan did not provide for any actions relating to Yirra at that time, they said. Now there are calls for more work of this kind to be done. “We hope that Yirra will help us tell our ancestral story to Australia and our future generations. We would still be visiting this site if it wasn’t for the mining leases,” Yinhawangka Aboriginal corporation (YAC) chair Halloway Smirke said. “All Pilbara groups should have this kind of science work done on cultural sites. “Important sites like Yirra need to be protected, especially when they turn out to be amongst the oldest known places of human habitation in Australia,” Smirke said. YAC heritage manager, archeologist and anthropologist Dr Anna Fagan said the study was globally significant. “This was the first study of its kind to be done, not for mining compliance or heritage clearance, but for Yinhawangka People and Country. The Yirra findings help overturn and reset ideas of desert presence in Australia and I’m confident in global narratives,” Dr Fagan said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for Rio Tinto said the company acknowledged the significance of Yirra “and are committed to working in partnership with the Yinhawangka people” to preserve it. “We’ve undertaken a geotechnical study to further our understanding of the surrounds of the site and implemented additional controls,” the spokesperson said, without elaborating. YAC conducted the archaeological work in collaboration with Archae-aus heritage consultants, and researchers from the University of Western Australia. Related: WA must toughen laws after revelation Rio Tinto dumped priceless Indigenous artefacts, heritage expert says Archae-aus director Fiona Hook, who excavated the site with her husband, the late Dr Bruce Veitch, and traditional owners more than 20 years ago, said the importance of the site has now been proven beyond doubt. “When the old dates were returned, I was overwhelmed by emotion. I’ve worked with three generations of Yinhawangka People at this place. It is such an immense relief that we finally got to return to the site and excavate Yirra again after 20 years of waiting,” Hook said. Rio Tinto said it plans to fund further traditional owner-led cultural research and archaeological excavations. “This is a wonderful outcome for the Yinhawangka people and we welcome this incredible discovery,” Rio’s iron ore chief executive Simon Trott said. “These findings at Yirra are a major archaeological breakthrough of international significance, expanding knowledge of Aboriginal occupation in the Pilbara,” Trott said.

None,Rio Tinto takes full control of Queensland alumina refinery after Russian oligarchs sanctioned,Australia news,66,None,"Rio Tinto has taken full control of an alumina refinery in which oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg hold stakes after the Australian government slapped sanctions on the pair and banned the export of bauxite products to Russia. The oligarchs have an interest in Queensland Alumina Limited through shareholdings in En+ Group, a London-listed resources company which owns the second-largest aluminium producer in the world, Rusal. Rusal owns 20% of QAL and Rio Tinto owns the remainder. In a statement, Rio Tinto said: “As a result of the Australian government’s sanction measures, Rio Tinto has taken on 100% of the capacity and governance of Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) until further notice.” “Our focus remains on ensuring the continued safe operation of QAL, as a significant employer and contributor to the local Gladstone and Queensland economies,” the company said.

In a statement released last month, En+ said Deripaska “cannot receive any type of financial benefit from his minority holding in En+, Rusal or any part of the group and is completely blocked from receiving dividends” as the result of a 2019 deal with US authorities under which the companies were released from sanctions and the oligarch reduced his shareholding to 45%. “According to public sources, Mr Vekselberg is indirectly a minority beneficiary,” Rusal’s spokesperson said. “He does not have any influence on Rusal’s operations.” Activists who have poured pressure on Australian companies to sever ties with Russian oligarchs after the invasion of Ukraine welcomed the move. Related: Australian government extends sanctions to Russian oligarchs Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg However, Dan Gocher, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said that “until Rio Tinto provides further details we remain concerned that Deripaska and Vekselberg may still financially benefit from Queensland Alumina”. “At Rio Tinto’s annual general meeting in London later today, the board is likely to face questioning from shareholders about its relationship with Rusal,” he said. He said Origin Energy, which is in a gas exploration joint venture in the Beetaloo basin with Falcon Oil & Gas, a company in which Vekselberg holds a stake, should follow Rio’s lead. “Origin is clearly attempting to weather the storm,” he said. “We have to ask what is the point of sanctions, if Vekselberg can still profit from any successful exploration in the Beetaloo Basin. “Origin Energy should suspend its joint venture with Falcon Oil & Gas until Viktor Vekselberg’s interest in Falcon is quarantined.” Origin has previously said it will “follow any rules dictated by the Australian government, and other governments as appropriate, with respect to sanctions”. “Origin is the majority owner and operator of the Beetaloo Joint Venture with significant operational control over any activities undertaken in the Beetaloo Basin.

None,Rio Tinto to sever ties with Russian businesses over Ukraine war,Business,88,None,"Global mining company Rio Tinto says it is severing its ties with Russia, throwing into doubt an aluminium joint venture between it and Rusal, which was founded by oligarch Oleg Deripaska. In a one-line statement, Rio Tinto said it was “in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business”. Related: Origin Energy and Rio Tinto urged to review joint ventures with Russian oligarchs Rio is reviewing its joint venture with Rusal in Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL) which runs an alumina refinery in Gladstone. Thursday’s decision creates a fuel supply problem for Rio’s Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, which relies on Russian diesel. It comes as more western businesses turn their backs on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, with Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other big brands joining the rush for the exit in the past 24 hours, amid sanctions that have laid waste to large sections of the Russian economy. QAL is 80% owned by Rio and 20% by Rusal, where Deripaska continues to hold a stake through their London-listed parent company, EN+ Group. Deripaska and EN+ were among the oligarchs and companies sanctioned in 2018 by the US government over issues including the invasion of Crimea in 2014.

None,Origin Energy and Rio Tinto urged to review joint ventures with Russian oligarchs,Australia news,68,None,"Origin Energy and Rio Tinto have been urged to review joint ventures with Vladimir Putin-linked oligarchs to ensure they are blocked from receiving any profit from Australia’s natural resources, as pressure mounts on investors to dump their stakes in Russian companies. Australian investors are being urged to follow the lead of British fossil fuel multinational BP, which has announced it will dump its US$14bn stake in Russian oil group Rosneft. Origin is in a joint venture with a company part-owned by oligarch Viktor Vekselberg , who is already under US sanctions, to explore for gas in the Beetaloo Basin – a region the Morrison government has touted as a core part of its proposal for a gas-led recovery from the Covid crisis. Vekselberg and another US-sanctioned oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, together own about three-quarters of Russian aluminium company Rusal, which in turn owns 20% of Queensland Alumina Limited, a bauxite miner and alumina producer. Related: Australia’s Future Fund to divest $200m of holdings in Russian companies Deripaska and Vekselberg are currently sanctioned by the US government over Russia’s 2014 invasion of the Crimea and the country’s continued occupation of the Ukrainian territory. Neither is currently sanctioned by Australia, which last week expanded its list of barred people and institutions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The retirement savings of ordinary Australians are also invested in Russian companies through at least five big super funds – the nation’s largest, AustralianSuper, Energy Super, West Australian government fund GESB, education and community sector fund NGS and retail worker fund Rest, according to research by investor activist group Market Forces. Dan Gocher, the director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said that as a result of the Russian invasion Australian companies, including Origin and Rio, “must immediately review their relationships with companies owned or part-owned by oligarchs aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin”. Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, and Australia’s second-biggest fund, Aware Super, have announced they will divest from Russia. The moves come as western nations ramp up sanctions on Russia that have so far slashed as much as 40% from the value of the rouble and led the country’s central bank to temporarily close the Moscow stock exchange in a bid to stave off a market collapse that analysts see as inevitable. “The world has spoken, and the strategy now is to isolate Russia completely,” Gocher said. “Origin and Rio Tinto’s ongoing cooperation with oligarch-owned companies legitimises Putin’s regime. “Furthermore, some of the profits from Australian alumina and oil and gas projects will end up in the hands of the people responsible for propping up Putin’s murderous regime.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gocher and the Australian director of transparency activist coalition Publish What You Pay, Clancy Moore, said the Morrison government should also rule out giving grants to the Origin project as part of a $50m program to kickstart exploration in the Beetaloo Basin. “Australia’s natural resource wealth should benefit our communities not line the pockets of Russian oligarchs,” Moore said. “Australian resources companies must ensure that no revenues or economic benefits flow to supporters of the Putin regime.” He said the government also needed to provide much better transparency of mining interests. “This includes a public list of who ultimately owns and benefits from mining, gas and oil projects,” he said.

None,"Bullying, sexual harassment and racism rife at Rio Tinto, workplace review finds",Business,91,None,"Bullying, sexual harassment and racism are common throughout Rio Tinto, according to a review of the global miner’s workplace culture conducted by Australia’s former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick. Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, said the findings were “deeply disturbing” and he promised the company would implement all 26 recommendations Broderick made to improve its culture. “I offer my heartfelt apology to every team member, past or present, who has suffered as a result of these behaviours,” he said on Tuesday. “This is not the kind of company we want to be.” Broderick and her team received survey responses from 10,000 of Rio’s 45,000 employees and conducted 109 “group listening sessions” around the world. There were also 85 confidential one-on-one meetings. Related: ‘Loud’ academic awarded more than ?100,000 for unfair dismissal Broderick said the majority of women who responded experienced “everyday sexism” such as being left out of meetings, not being provided with a women’s toilet or “even being asked to take notes, get coffee, or even do a colleague’s washing” while 21 women reported an actual or attempted rape or sexual assault in the past five years. “Bullying is systemic, experienced by almost half of the survey respondents,” she said in the report released by Rio on Tuesday. “Sexual harassment and everyday sexism occur at unacceptable rates. Racism is common across a number of areas.” Broderick said everyday sexism was damaging in its own right but also “creates fertile ground for more serious misconduct, such as sexual harassment and sexual assault”. Sexual harassment “was a significant organisational challenge”, she said, experienced by 43% of women working at fly-in fly-out (Fifo) and drive-in drive-out mine sites and 28% of women across the entire company. “Women at Fifo worksites spoke of eating alone in their room to avoid harassment in the dining hall and the gym; of avoiding being out after dark; of bad lighting and poor security; and of harassing and even threatening behaviour from male colleagues when they were walking to their accommodation after work,” Broderick said. “Women also spoke of the lack of consequences when they reported these incidents; and of having to carry the burden of managing the situation themselves, rather than receiving support from management or human resources.” Racism was also rife, with 39.8% of men who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experiencing it in the past five years. Only 12.4% of men who do not identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experienced racism in the past five years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than a third of both men and women working for the company in South Africa experienced racism. “As one employee commented ‘Rio is a Caucasian oriented company,’” Broderick said. The survey found that 48.4% of employees experienced bullying – 53% of women and 47% of men. “Employees described expectations that they should ‘toughen up’ for ‘life in a global miner,’” Broderick said. She said LGBTIQ+ employees also experienced “significantly elevated rates of bullying, sexual harassment and racism”. “Overall, their comments suggest that the same hyper-masculine norms and culture that can fuel everyday sexism and sexual harassment can also fuel heterosexism, making the inclusion and safety of employees who identify as LGBTIQ+ a priority in any cultural reform,” she said. She said Rio needed to adopt the same approach to psychological safety as it does towards physical safety, where the company “recognises that workplaces cannot be free from injury or critical incidents if employees do not feel confident to report unsafe practices or risks”. “The project revealed that this confidence is not common amongst Rio Tinto employees for complex and sensitive interpersonal issues such as sexual harassment, racism and bullying,” she said. “Similarly, employees participating in the listening sessions described a ‘culture of silence’ and negative impacts from reporting; of a lack of confidentiality; and of the subject of complaints being protected and even rewarded.” Related: Morrison government to take action on Jenkins inquiry into toxic culture before parliament returns One participant said they still feared the person who bullied them, even though they had left Rio. “The culture of the team was really rotten to the core while he was leader,” they said. “Once that person starts firing your colleagues for speaking out, they have a level of power over you.” Broderick commended Rio for making cultural changes over the past 12 months, but warned that the company was “only at an early stage along this path”. She said staff were confident Rio could do better. “In my interactions with the Rio Tinto leadership team, I have observed a strong desire for transformational change, as well as to make positive contributions to the societal shifts that we need to see. “There is clear recognition, however, that new approaches are needed to solve these issues.” A separate parliamentary inquiry in WA is examining sexual harassment at fly-in-fly-out mining sites. Tuesday’s report follows turmoil among the top ranks of Rio after it blew up culturally significant 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, in the Pilbara, in order to mine more iron ore. ?

None,Serbia scraps plans for Rio Tinto lithium mine after protests,World news,92,None,"The Serbian government has revoked the lithium mining licences granted to the Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto after growing opposition to the company’s plans and souring relations with Australia after the deportation of Novak Djokovic. Ana Brnabi?, the Serbian prime minister, who faces a general election in early April, said all decisions and licences regarding Rio Tinto’s plans had been annulled because of environmental concerns. The decision in effect pulls the plug on a potential $2.4bn (?1.8bn) investment by Rio Tinto in developing the country’s lithium resources, which could have made Serbia one of the world’s biggest producers of the highly sought-after metal used in the manufacturing of electric vehicles. The government U-turn comes after weeks of protests against the project in the capital, Belgrade, and swathes of smaller towns across the country over the environmental and health impact of the project. It also comes as relations between Belgrade and Canberra have soured after the high-profile deportation of Djokovic from Australia on Sunday before the Australian Open for failing to comply with Covid-19 vaccination rules. The defending Australian Open champion shared a photograph of the protests against Rio Tinto’s plans with his 10.1 million followers on Instagram, and commented that “clean air, water and food are keys to health”. In a televised address, Brnabi? said the government had “fulfilled all the demands from the environmental protests and have put an end to Rio Tinto in the Republic of Serbia”. Rio Tinto said late on Thursday that it was “extremely concerned” by the prime minister’s statement. Its share price tumbled on the Australian markets, closing 4.1% lower after its worst intra-day drop since August 2021. In London, Rio’s shares were down more than 3% on Friday morning. “Rio Tinto is reviewing the legal basis of this decision and the implications for our activities and our people in Serbia,” the company said. Earlier this week Brnabi? said the government was prepared to “fight against” any potential lawsuit from Rio Tinto linked to its cancellation of the project. Related: Rio Tinto’s past casts a shadow over Serbia’s hopes of a lithium revolution After Thursday’s announcement, activists called on opponents of the mine to increase pressure on the government until it banned future lithium and borate mining projects in the country. “Just one more step.

The hunt for lithium has set off a “white gold rush” across the globe as major corporations, including carmakers, scramble to secure sufficient supplies to meet their ambitious goals to switch to greener fuel sources and technology.

Loznica’s municipal assembly last week scrapped the land allocation for the mine .

None,"Rio Tinto should face judicial inquiry over Marandoo mine, Indigenous groups say",Business,84,None,"Traditional owners who lost hundreds of artefacts and haven’t been paid royalties under a deal brokered between the Western Australian government and Rio Tinto in the early 1990s say the mining company should face a judicial inquiry. The federal parliamentary inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters held its final public hearing on Friday. The last to give evidence, Rio Tinto’s Australian chief executive, Kellie Parker, and Indigenous general manager of operation, Brad Welsh, told the inquiry the company had undergone significant change since the inquiry began last year. Parker used the hearing to publicly apologise to the Eastern Guruma people for the destruction of hundreds of artefacts that were salvaged from Rio Tinto’s Marandoo mine in the 1990s, sent to Darwin to be studied, and ended up in a rubbish dump. Related: Rio Tinto accused of allowing irreplaceable Indigenous artefacts to be dumped in rubbish tip Consent to salvage the materials was granted by the WA government in 1992 under the Aboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation used to approve the destruction of Juukan Gorge. Management of the mine was authorised under a separate act of parliament, the Marandoo Act 1992, which meant the Eastern Guruma people were unable to mount any legal challenges and also do not receive ongoing royalties. “I acknowledge that the events of Marandoo, including the passage of the act, the disposal of salvaged materials, and the reduced access to country have all caused hurt and pain for Eastern Guruma traditional owners,” Parker told the hearing. “I reiterate our apology to the Eastern Guruma and confirm Rio Tinto is committed to working with them to support the repeal of the Marandoo Act, modernise our agreement to meet our shared expectations of partnership, and do our best to heal the wounds of the elders and the Eastern Guruma people.” Liberal senator for Western Australia Dean Smith asked why Rio should not face a judicial inquiry for its actions, comparing it to the decision to call a judicial inquiry into Crown casino in Perth after it had lost its social licence to operate. Parker said the company had “transparently” provided information to the parliamentary committee, and was “changing our business, not only in the way that we do business but the work that we do with traditional owners and how we protect cultural heritage”. Tony Bevan, a director of Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation, which represents the Eastern Guruma people in the Marandoo agreement, said Rio had also lost its social licence and should face a judicial inquiry. Related: Rio Tinto’s alleged underpayment of traditional owners of WA mine area sparks calls for widespread review “They should face a judicial inquiry just so they can be compelled to answer the questions, because there’s quite a few questions today that they did not answer,” Bevan told Guardian Australia. The Marandoo artefacts were sent to the Northern Territory University, now Charles Darwin, and disposed of in 1995 and 1997. The committee heard the university had not responded to an invitation to give evidence. “It appears from our records that we at Rio Tinto have become aware of the disposal after the fact, and on becoming aware of the disposal Rio Tinto should have communicated this directly to the traditional owners,” Parker said. “We don’t have any records to show if this was communicated to traditional owners or not. If we didn’t communicate this to them at the time, we absolutely regret that. But we also haven’t identified any evidence that there was a deliberate decision to withhold such information from Eastern Guruma people.” Welsh said artefacts salvaged were reviewed by archeologists from Northern Territory University prior to being destroyed, and that the material destroyed appears to have been determined to be “non-artifactual”. He added that Rio still holds 500 sample bags full of artefacts belonging to Eastern Gurruma people. “The large number of types of materials that have been retained, and the subsequent research on these, suggest to us that significant efforts were made to salvage items of cultural value,” Welsh said. The Labor senator for Western Australia Patrick Dodson asked Parker if Rio agreed that the principle of free, prior and informed consent, which is a core principle of the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, should be included in Australian laws governing the protection of cultural heritage. He also asked if Rio believed native title holders should have an exclusive right to determine whether their sacred site can be destroyed or not. Parker said Rio “continues to strive to achieve free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous communities and we’ve learned a lot since Juukan” She also said the company “recognises that traditional owners are the only people who can determine cultural significance”. Dodson said neither response really answered the question. Parker also said Rio Tinto had begun talking to Reconciliation Australia, which severed its relationship with the mining company after it destroyed Juukan Gorge against the wishes of the traditional owners at the start of reconciliation week last year , to see how they might repair the relationship. “We recognise that not only did we break trust with Reconciliation Australia, we very much damaged their program that has been going for 20 years through our actions and particularly the timing of our actions,” Parker said. The committee is due to file its final report by 18 October. Guardian Australia understands the WA government is aiming to have its updated Aboriginal heritage laws through parliament by then, with the drafting process pushed along by the premier’s office. Related: ‘Favouring industry’: protesters demand stronger Aboriginal heritage bill to protect sacred WA sites The laws have been met by extensive protest from traditional owner groups in WA , who say there has been a lack of consultation and the new laws will be unworkable and not offer any further protection. The draft legislation was unanimously rejected at the Yule River meeting, an on-country gathering of traditional owners in the Pilbara, on Thursday. The Aboriginal affairs minister, Stephen Dawson, declined to attend. “It should be consulted with Aboriginal people, but the government wrote it without us. We want to write it with them,” said Doris Eaton, a Njamal and Pitjakarli elder and co-chair of the Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation. “Ask us, not tell us, what we want.

None,"After 32 years, Rio Tinto to fund study of environmental damage caused by Panguna mine",World news,64,None,"Thirty-two years since it fled Bougainville island, Rio Tinto has promised to fund an independent assessment of the ongoing environmental damage caused by its Panguna mine, a move landowners have welcomed as “a start” towards repairing decades of contamination. The mining giant has committed to a multi-million dollar “environmental and human rights impact assessment” of its former copper and gold mine in Panguna, which was the flashpoint for Bougainville’s decade-long civil war. The commitment has come in response to a formal complaint filed last September by 156 residents of local communities downstream of the mine, who allege that more than one billion tonnes of mine waste dumped into the Kawerong-Jaba river delta continues to wreak catastrophic environmental damage and is putting their lives and livelihoods at risk . Related: Rio Tinto accused of violating human rights in Bougainville for not cleaning up Panguna mine The communities, represented by the Melbourne-based Human Rights Law Centre, have been in discussions with Rio Tinto since December, in negotiations facilitated by the Australian government. The assessment of Panguna will be conducted by an independent third party and will identify environmental and human rights impacts and risks posed by the mine and develop recommendations for remediation. Rio Tinto has not yet committed to funding the mine clean-up; this will be the subject of further discussions after the assessment is completed. Panguna was once one of the world’s largest and most profitable copper and gold mines, at one point accounting for 45% of all of PNG’s exports. But less than 1% of profits from the mine went to Bougainville and landowners say the mine left them with political division, violence, and environmental degradation. In 1989, amid rising community anger at the environmental damage and the inequitable division of the mine’s profits, customary landowners forced the mine closed, blowing up Panguna’s power lines and sabotaging operations. The PNG government sent in troops against its own citizens to restart the foreign-owned mine, sparking a decade-long civil war that led to the deaths of as many as 20,000 people. A peace settlement was brokered in 2001. In 2019, the province voted overwhelming - 98% in favour - for independence. Rio Tinto has never returned to Panguna, claiming it is unsafe for its staff, and divested from the mine in 2016. Bougainville MP Theonila Matbob , whose constituency includes Panguna and whose father was killed in Bougainville’s civil war, said the environmental problems caused by the mine needed urgent investigation so “clean-up can begin”. “This is a start … this is an important day for communities on Bougainville. Our people have been living with the disastrous impacts of Panguna for many years and the situation is getting worse. The mine continues to poison our rivers with copper. “Our kids get sick from the pollution and communities downstream are now being flooded with mine waste. Some people have to walk two hours a day just to get clean drinking water. In other areas, communities’ sacred sites are being flooded and destroyed.” Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm said the assessment commitment was “ an important first step ” to dealing with the legacy of the Panguna mine. “Operations at Panguna ceased in 1989 and we’ve not had access to the mine since that time. Stakeholders have raised concerns about impacts to water, land and health and this process will provide all parties with a clearer understanding of these important matters, so that together we can consider the right way forward. “We take this seriously and are committed to identifying and assessing any involvement we may have had in adverse impacts in line with our external human rights and environmental commitments and internal policies and standards.” Keren Adams, legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the assessment will need to be followed up by comprehensive remediation work. “Communities urgently need access to clean water for drinking and bathing. They need solutions to stop the vast mounds of tailings waste eroding into the rivers and flooding their villages, farms and fishing areas. They need their children to be able to walk to school without having to wade through treacherous areas of quicksand created by the mine waste. This is what remediation means in real terms for the people living with these impacts.”",2021/7/21 13:49,Ethical Responsibility|Well-being|Accountability|Execution,Remediation & Restoration Efforts|Community & Public Well-being|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Infrastructure & Maintenance|Corporate & Historical Responsibility,"{""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""positive"", ""Community & Public Well-being"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""Rio Tinto to fund study of environmental damage"", ""Community & Public Well-being"": ""Our kids get sick from the pollution"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""has never returned to Panguna, claiming it is unsafe for its staff"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""the mine left them with political division, violence, and environmental degradation"", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""communities’ sacred sites are being flooded and destroyed"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""the assessment will need to be followed up by comprehensive remediation work""}",The Guardian
None,"No more welcome to country for Rio Tinto, Indigenous owners say ",Business,68,None,"Aboriginal traditional owners have told mining giant Rio Tinto they will no longer do “welcome to country” for Rio related events, and are refusing to meet with the company until it demonstrates it is “serious” about modernising its agreements with them. The Eastern Guruma people have canned any meetings with Rio Tinto for at least three months, after discovering priceless cultural materials salvaged from their sacred sites were thrown in a rubbish dump in the 1990s, and that Rio did not tell them of the mistake. Related: Rio Tinto accused of allowing irreplaceable Indigenous artefacts to be dumped in rubbish tip The Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal corporation (WGAC), which represents the traditional owners, has told Rio Tinto that elders will not do a welcome to country for any Rio events, or any events that Rio sponsors in the region, in protest. A welcome to country is an important mark of respect, where traditional owners or custodians give their blessing to events held on their lands. “A welcome to country is obviously important in terms of showing proper respect and educating people about whose country it is,” WGAC’s chief operating officer, Tony Bevan, said. “From an Indigenous perspective it is important, but sometimes I think large companies tend to commoditise it, and they put great value on it as a PR exercise. “They say ‘we’re doing a wonderful job’ or ‘aren’t we a wonderful company that we’ve got this welcome to country’. So one of the things about withholding the welcome to country was to not allow that recognition to Rio. “We’re just not pretending that it’s at all OK and that they’re welcome to country,” Bevan said. Forty per cent of Rio’s Pilbara mine holdings are on Eastern Guruma traditional lands. Rio has promised major changes to its procedures following the destruction of 46,000 year old caves in Juukan Gorge in May last year. They will put an end to so-called “gag clauses” which prevented traditional owners from speaking publicly about heritage destruction. Rio said it is also developing detailed heritage management protocols to enhance cultural protection. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have committed to all traditional owners on whose land we operate in the Pilbara that we will modernise our agreements with them,” a Rio Tinto spokesperson said. “This includes changing the way we work together, putting in place measures to ensure greater awareness, respect and preservation of cultural heritage and improving the economic and social outcomes that come from mining. “Our leadership team are … committed to meeting with the WGAC again when they are ready.,” the spokesperson said. “This will take time, consistent effort and open dialogue to rebuild trust and reset our relationship for the future.” Bevan said the discovery that materials had been disposed of in the 1990s has hurt traditional owners deeply. “I observe that pain at every board meeting, in terms of the pain they feel about the destruction of country and particularly the cumulative impact. It’s real and it’s lived and it’s significant.” WGAC’s board is calling for an independent “umpire” to monitor agreement making with mining companies in the wake of the Juukan Gorge disaster. “There needs to be some oversight that ensures it is a fair, appropriate, reasonable agreement that meets today’s standards, because of the power imbalance and because these one-sided agreements will continue unless there is some oversight,” Bevan said.",2021/7/6 3:30,Respect|Accountability|Ethical Responsibility,Cultural & Language Respect|Transparency & Disclosure|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Cultural & Language Respect"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Cultural & Language Respect"": ""No more welcome to country for Rio Tinto, Indigenous owners say  Aboriginal traditional owners have told mining giant Rio Tinto they will no longer do “welcome to country” for Rio related events, and "", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""discovering priceless cultural materials salvaged from their sacred sites were thrown in a rubbish dump in the 1990s, and that Rio did not tell them of the mistake."", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""WGAC’s board is calling for an independent “umpire” to monitor agreement making with mining companies in the wake of the Juukan Gorge disaster."", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""the destruction of 46,000 year old caves in Juukan Gorge in May last year."", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""From an Indigenous perspective it is important, but sometimes I think large companies tend to commoditise it, and they put great value on it as a PR exercise.""}",The Guardian
None,"WA must toughen laws after revelation Rio Tinto dumped priceless Indigenous artefacts, heritage expert says",Australia news,87,None,"One of Western Australia’s leading heritage experts says the government must toughen up its heritage laws in the wake of allegations that mining giant Rio Tinto allowed the dumping of priceless Aboriginal cultural materials and did not inform the traditional owners for 25 years. Peter Veth, a senior archaeologist and heritage commentator who was involved in surveying of the artefacts, said new laws must ensure such a “traumatic” mistake cannot happen again. “The state has to show leadership. It’s a really tough portfolio. It’s big money. And if they can’t get the compliance right in an area worth tens of billions of dollars – and of the Pilbara, which is one of the great heritage estates in the world – then we’re not a modern state. We’re locked in the 50s,” said Veth, a professor at the University of Western Australia. Related: Rio Tinto accused of allowing irreplaceable Indigenous artefacts to be dumped in rubbish tip Rio Tinto has been accused of allowing hundreds of irreplaceable Aboriginal cultural artefacts salvaged from its Marandoo iron ore mine in the Pilbara to be thrown away at a rubbish dump in the 1990s, and failing to disclose the disposal to Aboriginal traditional owners. Eastern Guruma elders say they learned of the dumping after uncovering documents which show Rio Tinto and the WA government knew artefacts salvaged from their important and sacred sites in the 1990s had been thrown away, but failed to tell them. The Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal corporation (WGAC), representing the Eastern Guruma traditional owners, made the claims in a powerful submission to the federal parliamentary inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge. In 1992, Rio Tinto – through its subsidiary Hamersley Iron – sought approval for a large-scale iron ore mine at Marandoo, in the eastern part of traditional Eastern Guruma country within Karijini national park. Concerned that a large number of heritage sites would be destroyed, traditional owners organised a survey, in which bones, rock art, scarred trees, stone quarries and places of “outstanding cultural significance” were identified over a six-day visit in January 1992. Veth was part of that survey team. He recalls a senior colleague “begging” Hamersley’s representatives not to go ahead with the mine until a more thorough investigation of the sites had been done. “She was crying. She actually sat there and she finally burst into tears – a senior heritage person – saying ‘please, why can’t we just do [our] work, why can’t there be a higher level of observation of the heritage?’ “It required a different scale of excavation, of collection, of recording, and that wasn’t allowed to happen in a normal process … because the state and Hamersley basically took a very aggressive line,” Veth said. Rio Tinto outsourced the 1992 salvage work to a private engineering company, which shipped the bulk of the material to the Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University). In documents seen by Guardian Australia, materials salvaged from an 18,000-year-old rock shelter were accidentally “taken to the tip” by the university in a “devastating accident” in 1995. A large number of the remaining materials were then disposed of, with Rio’s approval, two years later. But salvage work was done at only 28 of an estimated 300 sites in the path of the Marandoo mine. According to WGAC, materials from 20 of those 28 sites are now gone. “For some of the sites, what was taken to the tip was the only remaining material left after the site’s destruction. There are no reports, data, photographs or documents of any kind that relate to this part of the salvage program,” WGAC’s submission says. The WA government granted consent for the mine on 2 February 1992 under the Aboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation which allowed Rio to blow up Juukan Gorge in May 2020, and which is now under review. But on 5 February 1992, it passed a separate law, the Marandoo Act, which gave Rio additional security for the mine and effectively prevented any legal challenges from Aboriginal people. Rio Tinto CEO Simon Trott said the company supports repealing the act and has been engaging with traditional owners and the WA government on “this important issue”. Trott reiterated Rio’s apology to the Eastern Guruma people. “We are not proud of many parts of our history at Marandoo and we reiterate our apology to the Traditional Owners of the land, the Eastern Guruma People, for our past actions. We know we have a lot of work ahead to right some of these historical wrongs. “Our leadership team are engaging regularly on this important work and are committed to meeting with the WGAC again when they are ready,” Trott said. A Rio Tinto spokesperson said materials remaining from the 1992 salvage works are in a safe-keeping place at its Brockman 2 and Dampier operations. Veth said the WA government must oversee how this work is contracted in future. “We believe that standards and accreditation [are] imperative for consultants, we’ve said this for 30 years,” Veth said. “Secondly, you want to have decent upfront time to assess the values. It’s a basic thing: where are the sites? What are the values? How can they be mitigated, managed? Why don’t we have proper interpretation and holding centres and keeping places on country? Why doesn’t the state invest in it?” Related: Pat Dodson attacks ex-WA Aboriginal affairs minister for joining Rio Tinto board Veth said while these questions are unanswered in the law, the risk remains that priceless material could be mined and thrown away. “There are protections that allow a ministerial intervention, that allow an area to be made a protected area, that allow fines to be imposed for deliberate and wanton destruction of sites, but the missing component of actually evaluating values and knowing what you’re dealing with … is not there. “There’s absolutely no trigger here to fund or support or, in a timely fashion, to have the values documented and discoverable, so we can manage them ... and that’s why there’s major opposition [to the current heritage bill].” The WA government said it has been in discussion with Rio Tinto and traditional owners about this matter, but had no prior knowledge of the allegations made by the WGAC on Friday. “The McGowan government continues to make improvements to the draft Aboriginal cultural heritage bill based on feedback from stakeholders, as we work towards the historic reform of Western Australia’s outdated Aboriginal cultural heritage system,” a spokesperson said.",2021/6/28 3:30,Ethical Responsibility|Integrity|Accountability|Collaboration,Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Legal & Regulatory Integrity|Transparency & Disclosure|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Data & Structural Integrity,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Data & Structural Integrity"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""allowed the dumping of priceless Aboriginal cultural materials and did not inform the traditional owners for 25 years"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""the government must toughen up its heritage laws"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""failing to disclose the disposal to Aboriginal traditional owners"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""did not inform the traditional owners for 25 years"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""allowed the dumping of priceless Aboriginal cultural materials"", ""Data & Structural Integrity"": ""There are no reports, data, photographs or documents of any kind that relate to this part of the salvage program""}",The Guardian

None,Rio Tinto accused of allowing irreplaceable Indigenous artefacts to be dumped in rubbish tip,Australia news,78,None,"Mining giant Rio Tinto has been accused of allowing hundreds of irreplaceable Indigenous cultural artefacts from the iron ore rich Pilbara region to be thrown away at a rubbish dump in Darwin, and failed to disclose the disposal to Aboriginal traditional owners for decades. Eastern Guruma traditional owners of Rio Tinto’s multi-billion dollar Marandoo mine, say they are “left with nothing” after finding out the company approved the destruction of artefacts salvaged from their important and sacred sites in the 1990s. Related: A year on from the Juukan Gorge destruction, Aboriginal sacred sites remain unprotected The Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal corporation says Eastern Guruma elders discovered their artefacts had “ended up in the bin” after obtaining documents which describe their “accidental, and then deliberate discarding and destruction”, which they say has never been disclosed to them by Rio Tinto. Based on their discovery, the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation – representing the Eastern Guruma traditional owners – has made a powerful new submission to the federal parliamentary inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge, accusing Rio Tinto and the Western Australia government of keeping the matter “a secret” ever since. In the documents, seen by Guardian Australia, materials salvaged from an 18,000-year-old rock shelter used by the Eastern Guruma were accidentally taken to the tip in Darwin in 1995. A large number of materials were disposed of, with Rio’s approval, two years later. A report to Rio Tinto in 1997 said the materials were stored in 66 large bags, most of which were “open”, in a shipping container that had “rusted out, and holes in the roof had let water onto and into some of the bags. Bags were labelled, however this did not always correspond with their contents.” The WGAC submission says: “So little was the respect for either the state’s conditions, or for the cultural heritage that was destroyed on a massive scale, hundreds of Eastern Guruma cultural artefacts ended up in the bin. It is WGAC’s view that the accidental, and then deliberate, discarding and destruction of Eastern Guruma cultural material was never disclosed to the Eastern Guruma people. “It is a secret that has been kept by Hamersley Iron [Rio Tinto’s wholly owned subsidiary] and the government for some 25 years.” Rio Tinto’s CEO, Simon Trott, said the company was “not proud of its history” at Marandoo and was engaging with traditional owners to right “historical wrongs”. “We’re not proud of many parts of our history at Marandoo and we reiterate our apology to the Traditional Owners of the land, the Eastern Guruma People, for our past actions,” Trott said. “We know we have a lot of work ahead to right some of these historical wrongs which fell well short of the standards we expect today. This will take time, consistent effort and open dialogue with the WGAC to rebuild trust and reset our relationship for the future. “Our leadership team are engaging regularly on this important work and are committed to meeting with the WGAC again when they are ready.” In 1992 Rio Tinto sought approval for a large scale iron ore mine at Marandoo, in the eastern part of traditional Eastern Guruma country within Karijini national park. The Eastern Guruma were concerned that a large number of heritage sites identified in a 1975 survey of the region, including ancestral burial sites, would be destroyed. They organised another survey, in which bones, rock art, scarred trees, stone quarries and places of “outstanding cultural significance” were identified over a six day visit in January 1992. Their report identified a further 105 heritage sites, and estimated another 300 sites of significance were in the path of the proposed mine, none of which had been adequately surveyed. The WA government approved Rio Tinto’s application in February 1992, on condition that it would avoid a significant rock art complex 30km to the west, protect the Thoongari burial sites, and salvage important materials, which would be sent interstate for collection and “safekeeping”. Related: Juukan Gorge traditional owners demand a say on Rio Tinto iron ore mine Rio Tinto outsourced the 1992 salvage work to a private engineering company, which sent material from a small number of rock shelters to the University of Western Australia, while the bulk of it was shipped to the Northern Territory University, or NTU (now Charles Darwin University). But in a 1995 letter, seen by Guardian Australia, the NTU told the engineering company that cultural material excavated from one site, an 18,000-year-old rock shelter that at the time was among the first evidence that Aboriginal people had lived in the Hamersley Range through the last ice age, “had accidentally been taken to the Darwin tip and discarded”. In March 1996 the engineering company told the WA government the cultural materials had been accidentally destroyed in a “devastating accident”. In 1997, it wrote to Hamersley Iron, Rio Tinto’s subsidiary operating the Marandoo mine, to propose an end to the project, which would involve the disposal of a large number of the items left at the university. The rest would be returned to Hamersley’s headquarters in Western Australia. Hamersley approved this proposal in January 1997. Remaining material was taken to the tip in Darwin and thrown away, along with notes, papers and records relating to all that had been salvaged. “The dumping of cultural material at the Darwin tip appears to have affected at least 20 of the 28 sites that were salvaged,” the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal corporation said. “For some of the sites, what was taken to the tip was the only remaining material left after the site’s destruction. There are no reports, data, photographs or documents of any kind that relate to this part of the salvage programme,” it said. WGAC also holds concerns for ancestral burial sites in a place called Manganese Gorge, which were supposed to be protected from the mine operations. “Elders today are deeply concerned that ancestral remains were within some of the dozens, if not hundreds, of unrecorded and poorly recorded rock shelters that were destroyed by the mining at Marandoo,” it said. “Again, WGAC has been unable to find any reports that can clarify which sites contained ancestral remains, and which sites currently contain ancestral remains.” Related: Explosives company will let workers refuse to blast if they fear damaging Indigenous heritage Traditional owners who are members of WGAC board have expressed their hurt and disbelief in the new parliamentary submission. “Only now we find out what really happened, that no one cared for our artefacts, our Old People’s things. It hurts us that our heritage was thrown in the bin,” the WGAC submission quotes one board member as saying. The WA government granted consent for the mine on 2 February 1992 under the Aboriginal Heritage Act – the same legislation which allowed Rio to blow up Juukan Gorge in May last year. But on 5 February 1992, the WA Labor government under Carmen Lawrence passed a separate law, the Marandoo Act, which gave Rio additional security for the mine and effectively prevented any legal challenges from Aboriginal people. WGAC say it is the only time that all protections for Aboriginal heritage have been removed within an area of land in Western Australia. Rio continues to operate under the Marandoo Act 1992, which is still in place nearly 30 years later. But now, in light of revelations about the disposal of their artefacts, the traditional owners say they want that legislation re-examined. “We felt it was a kick in the guts, that Rio took an approach that was so heavy handed, and so controlling. It is unbelievable that this act is still place today. Why? Why does Rio still have to hide behind the Marandoo Act? “We are releasing this story because we never want to see this happen again.” Rio Tinto’s CEO Simon Trott said Rio supports repealing the Marandoo Act 1992 and has been engaging with traditional owners and the WA government on this “important issue”. “We have committed to all Traditional Owners on whose land we operate in the Pilbara that we will modernise our agreements with them. This includes changing the way we work together, putting in place measures to ensure greater awareness, respect and preservation of cultural heritage and improving the economic and social outcomes that come from mining,” he said.",2021/6/25 13:09,Ethical Responsibility,Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""Rio Tinto expected to destroy 124 more Aboriginal sites""}",The Guardian

None,Pat Dodson attacks ex-WA Aboriginal affairs minister for joining Rio Tinto board,Australia news,90,None,"The Labor senator Pat Dodson has launched a scathing attack on the former Western Australian Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt for joining the board of the mining giant Rio Tinto, saying it showed “poor judgment” and would “do nothing” to restore Rio’s reputation after the Juukan Gorge disaster. Wyatt, a Yamatji man, was the Aboriginal affairs minister and treasurer in WA from 2017 to March this year when he retired from parliament. The state Labor minister was responsible for approving applications to destroy Aboriginal heritage – the same mechanism under which Rio received approval from a previous minister to destroy Juukan Gorge. Rio blasted the 46,000-year-old heritage site in May 2020, resulting in the departure of its chief executive, two senior executives and two board members, including the chairman. Related: Western Australia gas project ‘would create more emissions than Adani and damage Indigenous rock art’ Wyatt will take up the non-executive director position vacated by Michael L’Estrange, who wrote the company’s internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster in a process the academic Marcia Langton called “inadequate” and lacking transparency. The former state minister was also responsible for drafting WA’s new Aboriginal heritage laws, which are due to be introduced to parliament this year. The laws remove the contentious section 18 under which Juukan Gorge was destroyed but still allow the minister final say. Related: A year on from the Juukan Gorge destruction, Aboriginal sacred sites remain unprotected “Having left high office in the WA Labor government, Mr Ben Wyatt is entitled to pursue new career pathways,” Dodson said on Friday. “But his decision to join the board of Rio Tinto shows poor judgment and makes a mockery of the WA government’s ministerial code of conduct, which says ministers should exercise care in taking up employment immediately after leaving government.” Rio Tinto said Wyatt would join the board as a non-executive director in September. The announcement comes less than three months after Wyatt left politics and days after he announced he would join the board of Woodside Petroleum. “Mr Wyatt’s appointment will bring no credit to Rio Tinto and will do nothing to restore its reputation after the Juukan Gorge disaster,” Dodson said. “The company inherits the legacy of Mr Wyatt’s ministerial role in having approved harm to sacred sites under section 18 of the existing Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act. Rio Tinto may think it’s bought respectability by appointing Mr Wyatt, but Aboriginal people – especially those whose sacred sites are endangered by mining – will rightly be sceptical.” Wyatt declined to respond directly to Dodson’s criticism. But he told the ABC his appointment was a “win” which would increase pressure on other corporations to appoint Aboriginal people to their boards. “Me going on a board, whether it’s now or 12 months from now, I suspect I would have copped the same critique,” he said. “But I often put this to those critiquing: if I had gone on the board of an organisation that puts photovoltaic cells on roofs I suspect I wouldn’t have got a similar critique, I suspect that there’s bias against some of the mining companies.” Wyatt said it was “in the interests of every Australian” for Rio to get back to a position of leadership in the industry and reconnect with the Pilbara. “One of the biggest employers of Aboriginal people in the Pilbara is Rio Tinto, so I want it to be successful. It is not going anywhere but we need to recalibrate its relationships back with those key relationships.” Friday’s news comes after the two major explosives companies operating in WA, Dyno Nobel and Orica, granted their employees the right to refuse to undertake works they believed would pose an “unacceptable risk” to Indigenous cultural heritage. Wyatt had campaigned to reform the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act while in office but approved applications for mining companies to destroy heritage as recently as February. He released draft heritage laws for comment last year but did not support a moratorium on approving any applications to destroy or damage heritage until the new laws are passed. At the time, Wyatt argued that a moratorium was “not a practical solution in light of their use across a vast array of different projects most of which are uncontentious”. He has also written publicly opposing the introduction of a veto power , which was recommended by a federal parliamentary inquiry, saying that would undermine the ability of traditional owners and mining companies to negotiate. Dodson, a member of the inquiry committee, said Wyatt had supervised the drafting of heritage protection laws “which, although they are yet to be enacted, have been criticised as too weak – in particular because they don’t give traditional owners a right to veto destruction of their sacred sites”. Related: Juukan Gorge traditional owners demand a say on Rio Tinto iron ore mine But the chairman of the inquiry, the Queensland Liberal National MP Warren Entsch, said Wyatt had a chance to guide Rio Tinto towards “positive change”. “He certainly has had criticism that he deserves, but at the end of the day, I think he will very much learn from what happened there,” Entsch said. “He is in an excellent position, from his political contacts, and working with Rio, to make sure he can be the one spearheading the changes that are necessary to avoid it happening again.” Rio’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said he was delighted by the appointment. Related: Explosives company will let workers refuse to blast if they fear damaging Indigenous heritage “With family links to the Pilbara and an impressive track record in public life, Ben’s knowledge of public policy, finance, international trade and Indigenous affairs will significantly add to the depth of knowledge on the board at a time when we are seeking to strengthen relationships with key stakeholders in Australia and around the world.” Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said Wyatt’s experience made him an “attractive candidate” but would raise questions about political influence. “Given Woodside and Rio Tinto face enormous challenges in bringing their Western Australian operations into line with community expectations and ESG standards, it is fair to be concerned about their political influence,” she said. “From that perspective, the appointment of a very recently retired WA government minister who had responsibility for key portfolios should raise eyebrows about the revolving door between government and industry.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people who are the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge.",2021/6/4 17:23,Integrity|Customer Orientation|Ethical Responsibility,Anti-Corruption & Misconduct Allegations|Brand Perception & Reputation|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights,"{""Anti-Corruption & Misconduct Allegations"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""positive""}",0.7,"{""Anti-Corruption & Misconduct Allegations"": ""his decision to join the board of Rio Tinto shows poor judgment and makes a mockery of the WA government’s ministerial code of conduct"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""do nothing to restore its reputation after the Juukan Gorge disaster"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""I often put this to those critiquing: if I had gone on the board of an organisation that puts photovoltaic cells on roofs I suspect I wouldn’t have got a similar critique, I suspect that there’s bias ""}",The Guardian

None,Juukan Gorge traditional owners demand a say on Rio Tinto iron ore mine,Australia news,84,None,"The traditional owners of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters have demanded they be given a seat at the table in future planning of Rio Tinto’s $1.5bn iron ore mine in an effort to prevent the further destruction of cultural heritage. The 46,000-year-old heritage-listed rock shelter was blown up by Rio Tinto one year ago against the stated wishes of the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. “We want to ensure that we’re around the table when it comes to making decisions about impact on our country,” PKKP Aboriginal Corporation spokesman Burchell Hayes said. “We’re not going to let this happen again.” Rio Tinto destroyed two rock shelters, dubbed Juukan 1 and Juukan 2, on 24 May last year. Juukan 2 was dated at 46,000 years old and described, in an archaeological report commissioned and paid for by Rio Tinto, but which its senior executives had not read, as one of the most significant archaeological sites in Australia. Related: Juukan Gorge traditional owners say they are reluctant to continue dealing with Rio Tinto The company’s former chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques told a public inquiry last August that the sites had been destroyed to access an additional $135m worth of high-grade iron ore. Instead it resulted in an international backlash against the company, a moratorium on any mining activity at the site, the resignation of three senior executives including the CEO, the departure of two board members including the chairman, and a Senate inquiry with plans to overhaul cultural heritage management laws Australia-wide. In a video interview released ahead of the anniversary of the blast, Hayes said the loss of the rock shelters was made more devastating by the knowledge that it could have been prevented. He said it was impossible to compensate for the loss. “No amount of money will ever replace it,” he said. “Nothing. I’d rather have the rock shelter back than you write me a cheque. That’s how I feel about it.” The PKKP Aboriginal corporation chairman, John Ashburton, said Juukan Gorge was more than a rock shelter. “To us it is not rocks and carvings, to us this is precious,” he said. “It means something to us for many years ago, our ancestors looked after this. It was very important to them and now it’s passed on to us and that’s why it’s very important for us to look after this. “It’s not just any caves, it’s not just any rocks, it’s very important to us PKKP people.” Since the blast Rio has appointed a new chief executive for Australia, Kellie Parker, as well as a new global CEO, Jakob Stausholm. Stausholm said the company knows Juukan Gorge was “irreplaceable” and that the company had work to do “beyond the remediation of the site”. He committed to work “in partnership with traditional owners and Indigenous communities wherever we operate to secure a shared future”. “We understand that this will take time and we know we will be judged by our actions,” he said. “We must do better, and we will. That is our commitment.” The PKKP learned of the planned blast on 14 May 2020, one day after the company began setting explosives above the rockshelters. Rio Tinto continued setting explosives throughout the week, despite the PKKP’s objections. Three days before the blast, the company hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the PKKP to stop them from speaking out . It has since committed to removing the gag clauses from its agreements with traditional owners. A Senate inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge heard that senior Rio Tinto executives had not read detailed reports into the significance of the site. In an interim report released in December, the Senate inquiry described Rio’s actions as “inexcusable” and called for a moratorium on approvals to destroy heritage under Western Australia’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws. Hayes said leadership from Rio Tinto had been “non-existent” in the past and the company still had a lot of work to do to restore its relationship with the PKKP. “We’ve had to reset the relationship,” he said. “I’ve always said that we’re committed to building that relationship. We’re not opposed to mining. However, we want to ensure that we’re around the table when it comes to making decisions about impact on our country.” Hayes said the PKKP were demanding the right to co-manage their land with the mining company, to better protect cultural heritage. Related: Juukan Gorge inquiry: Rio Tinto's decision to blow up Indigenous rock shelters 'inexcusable' “That seat at the table for us ensures that we’ve got a voice and we’re heard,” he said. “That co-management [model] is to ensure that those voices that are normally silent when it comes to these kind of conversations and discussions and mine development, mine planning, that there is a voice there, a traditional owner voice,” he said. “To make sure that they’re hearing us and we work together to get an outcome where we are able to still protect and preserve our cultural landscape and the mining companies are able to continue doing their work.” He said Rio acted without the informed consent of the PKKP in destroying the sites, and that without informed consent “that relationship just doesn’t work”. “We want to do business with the mining proponent but we want to do it on our terms,” he said. In a statement, Rio’s Parker said she had made a commitment to Rio’s Indigenous employees “to do everything possible to make Rio Tinto a place where they can be proud to work again”. Parker said Rio was working to repair its relationship with the PKKP and was “discussing agreements” with traditional owner groups to “remove outdated and unreasonable clauses” and increase “engagement regarding our plans for mining”.

None,Rio Tinto shareholders rebel against ex-chief executive’s ?7.2m bonus,Business,92,None,"Rio Tinto’s shareholders have rebelled against the board’s decision to pay its outgoing chief executive his biggest ever pay packet despite overseeing the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia . Shareholders voted 61% against the miner’s remuneration policy, which handed a ?7.2m pay packet to the disgraced former chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques for last year, a 20% rise on his total pay the year before, despite the Juukan Gorge scandal. Jacques agreed to step down from the mining company “by mutual agreement” with Rio Tinto’s board last year after the miner blew up ancient rock shelters, which were highly significant to the area’s traditional owners, Indigenous Australians, so that it could mine better quality iron ore. The disgraced mining boss, who left the company on 1 January, was stripped of bonuses worth a total of ?2.7m following the disaster but will still take home the biggest pay packet for his time as chief executive. He was also handed an extra ?519,000 for his remaining five months of unworked notice period this year, and ?215,000 for his unused leave. At the same time, the ousted senior executives Simone Niven, the head of corporate relations, and Chris Salisbury, the head of iron ore, who also stepped down in the wake of the scandal, were given “termination benefits” worth $1m (?719,000) and $1.3m respectively. The vote was the most significant shareholder pay revolt in the UK this year but it is a non-binding advisory vote, meaning there will be no change to the windfall sums handed to the Rio Tinto senior executives. Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, who won’t be seeking re-election next year, said: “I absolutely understand the sense of outrage that people feel at the remuneration settlements that have been made for the departing executives.” Thompson told investors at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Perth on Thursday that he was “ultimately accountable” for the Juukan Gorge disaster and would use his remaining time with the company to “ensure that the destruction of a site of such exceptional cultural significance never happens again at a Rio Tinto operation”. In a statement, Rio Tinto’s board, which has struggled to smooth its relations with investors in the year since the disaster, acknowledged that its executive pay was “sensitive and contentious” in the wake of the tragic events at Juukan Gorge. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The head of Rio Tinto’s remuneration committee, Sam Laidlaw, who is the former boss of British Gas parent company Centrica , said the “loss of cultural heritage was tragic, and many have understandably sought to allocate appropriate accountability and responsibility”. He said the board understood the sensitivity and deeply regretted the destruction of the rock shelters and the “slow and initially insufficiently sensitive response”, but had concluded that it was not in a position to legally terminate the three executives and force the forfeit of their outstanding remuneration. Lee Wild, from Interactive Investor, an online investment firm, said the rebellion against Rio’s boardroom pay policy was “a real eye-opener”. The company said a recent survey of its clients found that typically just over six in 10 rarely vote at shareholder meetings. “Such a significant display of disapproval is evidence that shareholders can make themselves heard and shock companies into action. There is little doubt that Rio now understands the full strength of feeling against the behaviour of its executives and, in this case, an excessive and insensitive pay policy,” he said. Rio Tinto said the remuneration committee “will take time to reflect further on the feedback already received and on any new input obtained from this subsequent engagement, in particular as it considers the implementation of the new remuneration policy”.",2021/5/6 22:43,Respect|Ethical Responsibility|Accountability,Recognition & Appreciation|Environmental Governance & Accountability|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""positive"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""Rio Tinto’s shareholders have rebelled against the board’s decision to pay its outgoing chief executive his biggest ever pay packet despite overseeing the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old roc"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""blew up ancient rock shelters, which were highly significant to the area’s traditional owners, Indigenous Australians"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""The vote was the most significant shareholder pay revolt in the UK this year but it is a non-binding advisory vote, meaning there will be no change to the windfall sums handed to the Rio Tinto senior "", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, who won’t be seeking re-election next year, said: “I absolutely understand the sense of outrage that people feel at the remuneration settlements that have been ma""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto defends not stripping bonuses from executives who left amid Juukan Gorge outcry,Business,81,None,"Rio Tinto has defended its decision not to strip long-term bonuses from three executives, including the chief executive, who left the company following a community and shareholder backlash after the miner blew up 46,00-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. In a bid to stem shareholder anger, executives at the company will now earn part of their pay based on the company’s compliance with environmental, social and governance issues. The then chief executive, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, iron ore head, Chris Salisbury, and corporate affairs boss, Simone Niven, left the company in September . Related: Rio Tinto pledges to protect cultural heritage after Juukan Gorge disaster On Thursday, Rio senior independent director Sam Laidlaw told a meeting of shareholders it was clear many stakeholders felt the financial penalties imposed on the three “were insufficient and that to rebuild relationships with traditional owners and other stakeholders, changes of leadership were required to move the company forward”. He said the board had to balance a number of factors including that there “was no deliberate act or omission to act by the three executives” or “fraud, malfeasance or cover-up” against “a critical risk assessment failure going back many years” that could “be partially attributed to the three executives, who failed to recognise and remediate systemic weaknesses in the heritage risk management process” and “failed to apologise unconditionally, and respond with sufficient empathy towards the [traditional owners] PKKP and to recognise the gravity of what had happened within the wider societal context”. The three executives forfeited their short-term bonuses – worth more than ?1.7m in Jacques’s case – and an additional ?1m was stripped from Jacques’s long-term bonus, Laidlaw said. “Some have suggested that the failure of the three executives to respond appropriately should have resulted in the forfeiture of all outstanding remuneration,” he said. “The board understands this sensitivity and deeply regrets the destruction of the rock shelters and the slow and initially insufficiently sensitive response of the company. “Given these considerations, as well as various market precedents, the board concluded that it was not in a position to legally terminate the three executives for cause and forfeit all outstanding remuneration. Related: Rio Tinto chairman to stand down amid Juukan Gorge outcry “Instead, it was more appropriate that the three executives’ employment be terminated by mutual agreement (acknowledging the potential adverse effect that this may have on their longer-term careers).” Laidlaw said under Rio’s new pay arrangements, compliance with policy, environmental, social and governance measures would make up 15% of short-term bonuses. This will be achieved by reducing the proportion of bonuses linked to individual performance from 30% to 15%. “We have also importantly introduced a specific ability to apply malus and clawback if in the future there is a material impact on our social licence to operate,” Laidlaw said. Rio’s chairman, Simon Thompson, who did not stand for re-election at the meeting due to the Juukan Gorge scandal, and the new chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, again apologised for the decision to blow up one of Australia’s most significant archeological sites. “The work we have to do at Juukan Gorge is beyond the remediation of the site,” Thompson said.

Transfer of the land to the joint venture has been paused by the Biden administration . At the meeting, Rio also endorsed resolutions on climate put forward by two activist shareholder groups, Market Forces and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, calling for it to set emissions targets consistent with the Paris agreement and for it to suspend membership of industry organisations that don’t have global heating policies consistent with Rio’s. Asked if the endorsement of Market Forces’ resolution meant that the company recognised its current approach was not adequate, Thompson said: “Do we need to be more ambitious? I think the whole world needs to be more ambitious in tackling climate change.”",2021/5/6 20:07,Accountability|Respect|Ethical Responsibility,Corporate Governance & Oversight|Leadership Accountability|Recognition & Appreciation|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Ethical Compliance & Internal Control,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Leadership Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""negative""}",0.84,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""board had to balance a number of factors including that there “was no deliberate act or omission to act by the three executives” or “fraud, malfeasance or cover-up” against “a critical risk assessment"", ""Leadership Accountability"": ""the board concluded that it was not in a position to legally terminate the three executives for cause and forfeit all outstanding remuneration."", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""the three executives’ employment be terminated by mutual agreement (acknowledging the potential adverse effect that this may have on their longer-term careers).”"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""to rebuild relationships with traditional owners and other stakeholders, changes of leadership were required"", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""failed to recognise and remediate systemic weaknesses in the heritage risk management process”""}",The Guardian

None,Grovelling apologies fail to get Rio Tinto out of a hole,Business,84,None,"As acts of corporate vandalism go, Rio Tinto’s obliteration of a sacred site in Western Australia is right up there. The expansion of an iron ore mine knowingly destroyed a cave containing 46,000 years of human history . It had yielded a 4,000-year-old hair plait that showed a direct genetic link with living descendants. The scandal has already cost Rio Tinto a chief executive , Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and other bosses, but the backlash from the destruction of the Juukan Gorge is still reverberating, as the remaining executives at the FTSE 100 miner will find at its annual meeting on Friday. Shareholders appear to be rallying to give Rio Tinto another bloody nose. Hefty executive payoffs are particularly in the spotlight. Glass Lewis, Institutional Shareholder Services and Pirc have all advised their big investor clients to vote down Rio Tinto’s remuneration reports because of the payouts awarded to Jacques. ISS said Rio Tinto should use its power to claw back more of Jacques’s bonuses. He still held on to shares worth ?27m, ISS said, despite having had ?2.7m taken away last summer. Rio Tinto has spent the last few months doing its best impression of a grovelling corporate apology in an effort to convince angry investors that the company does in fact care about traditional owners of the Australian lands it wants to mine. Last week it held “cultural heritage” seminars and belatedly appointed an indigenous advisory group. The annual meeting could yield more changes. Revolts over pay are not a new phenomenon (even if fitful hopes that “ shareholder springs ” will result in meaningful executive pay cuts have so far proved false), but a newer trend will also be evident on Friday: increased pressure for climate action. Investors are likely to back a shareholder resolution calling for emissions-cuts targets as well as an advisory resolution that says the company should suspend membership of lobby groups whose policies contradict the Paris climate goals. Rio’s under-pressure board has given the climate resolutions its backing – although it has said it will not set gold-standard science-based targets. Experts are generally sceptical of corporate promises to cut carbon emissions if they are not science-based. The latest resolutions may not be the most onerous for the company, but they will give it fewer hiding places in future as pressure for actual emissions cuts ramps up. Polling by Interactive Investor, an online platform, last week showed that 70% of 1,000 retail investors surveyed said they would back a greater emphasis on climate concerns. Those measures would include adding climate metrics to bonus calculations, as well as targets on “cultural heritage management”. An identical proportion of the surveyed investors said that they believed company chairs and chief executives should be held to account on environmental, social and governance issues, Interactive Investor said. Retail investors may rarely tip the scales in company votes, given the size of big institutional shareholdings, but the scale of unease shows that executives cannot just tuck away environmental or social concerns in bland sustainability reports buried on their websites. Rio Tinto’s replacement chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, struck a philosophical tone last week on the Juukan Gorge debacle, commenting on the temporary nature of human existence. But there are signs that tougher scrutiny of environmental or social debacles might be here to stay.",2021/4/4 9:05,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Respect|Collaboration|Customer Orientation,Ethical Investment & Responsible Business|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Recognition & Appreciation|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action|Investor & Shareholder Communication,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""negative"", ""Investor & Shareholder Communication"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""Grovelling apologies fail to get Rio Tinto out of a hole As acts of corporate vandalism go, Rio Tinto’s obliteration of a sacred site in Western Australia is right up there.

None,Rio Tinto pledges to protect cultural heritage after Juukan Gorge disaster,Business,73,None,"Rio Tinto chief executive Jakob Stausholm has pledged to make protecting cultural heritage an issue which is “felt in the hearts and minds” of his employees in an effort to avoid another Juukan Gorge-style disaster. The mining company on Tuesday announced it would publicly report to investors on its progress on improving cultural heritage systems and renewing trust with traditional owners, as it attempts to rebuild its shattered social capital. It will also publicly report on its progress in implementing the recommendations from a parliamentary review into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old rock shelter at Juukan Gorge , and recommendations from its own internal review. Stausholm said the new executive team “feel very accountable” for ensuring an event like the destruction of Juukan Gorge never happens again. The incident led to the resignation of the three senior executives , including the former CEO, and prompted the chairman to step down . Related: 'Rio is still on notice': native title groups say mining company's reshuffle is mainly PR But Stausholm said achieving that goal required changes in the company which went “way beyond procedural”. “It’s has to be felt in the hearts and the minds, the same way as we have built safety culture over decades,” he said in an investor briefing on Tuesday morning. “The one big thing is to make sure that we consistently get this as a value.” Despite the negative publicity and heads rolling in senior management, the company reported a 20% rise in profits in 2020 and a record shareholder dividend of $9bn. Investors have welcomed the commitment to greater transparency, which was brokered in negotiations with stakeholders including the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), AustralianSuper, and HESTA. HESTA CEO Debby Blakey said investors put forward “very clear requests” around disclosure and governance arrangements and said it was “pleasing that we’ve had constructive discussions with Rio Tinto that can support progress towards managing this clear financial risk for investors”. “The steps the company has agreed to will support broader improvements in practices, disclosure and oversight urgently needed across the mining sector,” she said. “Rio is at the start of a very long process of rebuilding trust. It will require long-term commitment to deep-seated cultural change and strong frameworks and processes in place to support genuine, open and ongoing partnership with Indigenous communities, no matter who is in management or board roles.” ACSI CEO Louise Davidson said it was “positive” to see Rio Tinto commit to work more closely with traditional owners. “Investors will continue to engage with Rio Tinto, and other companies with cultural heritage exposures, to understand how they are managing these risks and measuring against commitments,” Davidson said. Rio committed to establishing an Indigenous advisory group, which will work with managers and may report to board level; modernising its approach to negotiating agreements with traditionally owners to remove confidentiality clauses; and spending $50m on attracting and retaining Indigenous people to work within the business. The company’s chief adviser of Indigenous affairs, Brad Welsh, said the number of Indigenous leaders in the organisation had doubled last year, though only from seven to 15. Rio also committed to measuring and reporting on social impact metrics, and to disclosing and explaining to traditional owners the likely heritage impact of projects, “as part of earning back trust” . Megan Clark, a non-executive director and chair of Rio’s sustainability committee, said changes to cultural management practices to make it an iterative process would “fundamentally change the way we do mining”. Clark said 1,000 cultural heritage sites in the Pilbara had been reviewed in the past 10 months, with a number of sites reclassified from being cleared for mining to protected. She said relationships between traditional owners and Rio managers and executives needed to develop beyond a business relationship into friendships, “where the communication channels are just open, and those relationships are deep and trusting so that something like this could never happen again”. “The one thing that still sticks in my mind as I look at what happened [at Juukan Gorge] and why it happened was: where was a quick phone call, where were all of those linkages that could have stopped it at any time?” she said. “And it’s a question that still sits there … those relationships with the traditional owners, they are as important as relationships with the prime minister of the countries in which we operate or the president in those countries. And I ask myself the question do we invest the same time in those relationships?” The National Native Title Council chief executive, Jamie Lowe, said investing in those relationships with traditional owners – “I don’t think friendships is the right word” – was essential to rebuilding trust. Related: 'Every day it's happening': Juukan Gorge inquiry told Aboriginal heritage is commonly destroyed “You can have an advisory body that may sit at a high level but the relationships with the traditional owners are vital because that’s literally where the work happens,” he said. “And you have seen from the Juukan Gorge inquiry that those relationships either weren’t there or weren’t respected. “So they will be talking some flash language and having deadly plans about what it will look like, but what it will look like will depend on the personnel. The personnel that you have is crucial, that’s how you build the relationships.” Lowe said the Indigenous advisory group would only be effective if it was given the necessary power and responsibilities. “If it’s just a peripheral body that meets four times a year, it’s not going to cut it,” he said.",2021/3/23 18:02,Ethical Responsibility|Agility|Accountability|Respect,Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Strategic Adaptation & Flexibility|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Trust & Relationship Building,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""positive"", ""Strategic Adaptation & Flexibility"": ""positive"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""positive"", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""positive""}",0.95,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""Rio committed to establishing an Indigenous advisory group, which will work with managers and may report to board level"", ""Strategic Adaptation & Flexibility"": ""Stausholm said the new executive team “feel very accountable” for ensuring an event like the destruction of Juukan Gorge never happens again."", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""The incident led to the resignation of the three senior executives , including the former CEO, and prompted the chairman to step down ."", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""Rio is at the start of a very long process of rebuilding trust.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto backs activist resolution to set emissions targets consistent with Paris agreement,Business,82,None,"The board of Rio Tinto has backed a shareholders push that would require the company to set emissions targets consistent with the Paris agreement and suspend membership of industry associations that lobby against action on the climate crisis. In a statement to the ASX on Friday afternoon, the mining company recommended shareholders endorse two resolutions brought by activist groups, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) and Market Forces, ahead of Rio’s annual general meeting in May. “For the first time, the board of an Australian company has supported a shareholder resolution, Rio Tinto should be commended for this,” Dan Gocher, the director of climate and environment at the ACCR, said. “The board of Rio Tinto, already under significant pressure from shareholders, has finally acknowledged that its funding of Australia’s climate stalemate goes against its own long-term interests.” Related: Rio Tinto chairman to stand down amid Juukan Gorge outcry In an addendum to its notice of its 2021 AGM, the company said it was recommending shareholders vote in favour because its current approaches were already “substantially consistent” with both of the proposed resolutions. The ACCR’s resolution calls on Rio Tinto to strengthen its annual review process examining industry and lobby groups of which it is a member, such as the Minerals Council of Australia, the Queensland Resources Council and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia. The resolution proposes the company suspend its membership if the association’s record of advocacy and lobbying is found, on balance, to be inconsistent with the Paris agreement. Gocher said Rio Tinto’s most recent review, published last month, failed to identify any misalignment within its Australian industry associations, despite an advertising campaign run by the Queensland Resources Council during last year’s state election and the council’s support for the Morrison government’s so-called gas-fired recovery. “Yet Rio Tinto has steadfastly refused to comment on this advocacy, or attempted to rein it in,” he said. Rio Tinto said on Friday it would consider suspending its membership if it identified significant inconsistencies but remained of the view that “securing advocacy aligned with the Paris agreement is best pursued from a position of influence from within such associations”. “In weighing up the relative merit of continued membership, the board will exercise a balanced judgement of what is in the best interests of the company and will consider suspension of membership as a measure of last resort,” the statement said. The resolution moved by Market Forces asks Rio Tinto to disclose its short, medium and long-term targets for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, its performance against those targets, and for those targets to be independently verified as consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. Scope 1 emissions are the direct emissions from a company’s operations, while Scope 2 emissions are the indirect emissions from the energy used by the company. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, said the board’s recommendation was an “important recognition from Rio Tinto that its climate ambition has been inadequate so far”. Rio Tinto said its 2020 annual report set out its Scope 1 and 2 targets and its performance against them was “independently assured”. It said the company described how these targets aligned with the Paris agreement in its climate change report . “Rio Tinto will continue to disclose these targets and its independently assured performance against them in its annual reports in the decade ahead,” the company said. Market Forces, in its supporting statement to its shareholder resolution, said targets announced by Rio Tinto in February last year to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline fell well short of what could be considered consistent with the Paris agreement. Vincent said that assessing the company’s performance against those targets was not sufficient if they were not also being independently audited for consistency with the Paris agreement. “The material supporting our resolution makes clear that Rio Tinto’s current targets fall well short of what’s required to be in line with the Paris agreement,” Vincent said. “It’s a really odd contradiction – Rio Tinto is claiming to be Paris aligned while endorsing a resolution that establishes how it isn’t.” Vincent said the bigger task would be to address Scope 3 emissions and the organisation intended to lodge a shareholder resolution on Scope 3 emissions ahead of Rio Tinto’s 2022 AGM. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain, such as from the processing and use of products a company sells and the transportation of those products, both domestically and overseas. “The main game on climate is Rio Tinto’s Scope 3 emissions, which are 94% of the company’s total carbon footprint, and equivalent in size to Australia’s total emissions,” Vincent said. “Rio Tinto’s next climate risk report needs to clarify its risk appetite to this massively carbon liability, and tell shareholders how much it is prepared to be exposed to Scope 3 emissions in future.”",2021/3/19 18:46,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Agility,Ethical Investment & Responsible Business|Transparency & Disclosure|Environmental Governance & Accountability|Strategic Defense & Resilience,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""positive"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""positive"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""positive"", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""positive""}",0.9,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""suspend membership of industry associations that lobby against action on the climate crisis"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""disclose its short, medium and long-term targets for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""independently verified as consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement"", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""its current approaches were already “substantially consistent” with both of the proposed resolutions""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto chairman to stand down amid Juukan Gorge outcry,Business,77,None,"Rio Tinto’s chairman will stand down amid an outcry over the miner’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred indigenous site in Western Australia. Simon Thompson will leave Rio Tinto within the next year after accepting he was “ultimately accountable” for the company’s decision to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Rio Tinto blew up the rock shelters, which were highly significant to the area’s Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, to help it access better-quality iron ore deposits. The decision led to an outcry from Indigenous Australian groups and investors, and a cull of senior executives at the Anglo-Australian company. The chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the head of corporate relations Simone Niven, and the iron ore boss Chris Salisbury resigned in September last year. Jacques was paid ?7.2m for last year, a 20% rise , despite overseeing the disaster. Niven and Salisbury were given “termination benefits” worth US$1m and $1.3m respectively. Separately, the non-executive director Michael L’Estrange will retire after this year’s shareholder meeting. Rio Tinto said he needed to reduce his workload after “significant surgery”. L’Estrange wrote an internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster, which was later criticised by the Australian senator Pat Dodson as an “unsatisfactory piece of work” that was “full of mea culpas and corporate lingo”. Last week, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) called on investors to “hold Thompson and other board members accountable” and insist on “necessary, constructive change to the company’s board composition”. James Fitzgerald, a strategy leader at ACCR, said on Tuesday there would be “no realistic prospect of Rio Tinto rebuilding relationships, trust and reputation while those responsible for the degradation of its culture and social performance remain on the board.” He added: “The departure of Rio Tinto’s chair, Simon Thompson, and director Michael L’Estrange suggests that the company understands this.” The National Native Title Council also welcomed Thompson’s resignation but said that if Rio Tinto was serious about cultural change then it would replace at least one of the outgoing executives or directors with at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person. “They are in desperate need of First Nations voices in there and First Nations leadership,” said the council’s chief executive, Jamie Lowe. “And whether that be from an executive perspective or board level or other, that needs to happen … Because Rio Tinto is not going anywhere, they are a multinational company, they have got large footprints in Australia, so it’s critical we get those First Nations voices in there to make sure they are doing the right thing.” Lowe said that while the turnover in senior leadership was significant, he would wait to see if the company’s actions changed. “It’s no mean feat to get rid of your CEO, your chairman, other executives, other board members, all in the space of a six-month period,” he said. “They are signalling the right intent but the proof will be in the pudding, in the action that they deliver.”",2021/3/4 0:01,Accountability|Ethical Responsibility,Leadership Accountability|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Leadership Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.86,"{""Leadership Accountability"": ""Simon Thompson will leave Rio Tinto within the next year after accepting he was “ultimately accountable” for the company’s decision to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""replace at least one of the outgoing executives or directors with at least one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto investors welcome chair's decision to step down after Juukan Gorge scandal,Business,76,None,"Investors and First Nations groups have welcomed the Rio Tinto chair Simon Thompson’s decision to leave the company after accepting he was “ultimately accountable” for the mining company’s decision to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Thompson will not stand for re-election to the board next year in a decision that follows the resignations in September of the chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the head of corporate relations Simone Niven and the iron ore boss Chris Salisbury. Separately, the non-executive director Michael L’Estrange will retire after this year’s shareholder meeting. Rio Tinto said he needed to reduce his workload after “significant surgery”. Related: Former Rio Tinto CEO handed 20% pay rise despite caves scandal L’Estrange wrote the internal review of the Juukan Gorge disaster, which was later criticised by Senator Pat Dodson as an “unsatisfactory piece of work” that was “full of mea culpas and corporate lingo”.

He said it was “appropriate and timely” for Thompson to assist with the transition from Jaques to Jakob Stausholm, who was appointed CEO in December. “However, as Mr Thompson has said, he is ‘ultimately accountable’ for the failings that led to the Juukan Gorge incident, and as a result his resignation is an appropriate acknowledgement of that governance failure,” Silk said. Super fund Hesta, which campaigned heavily for change at Rio after Juukan Gorge, also welcomed the departures. “Investors need confidence Rio, throughout the organisation, will act in good faith with all stakeholders,” chief executive Debby Blakey said. “The decision today allows for a fresh perspective and a renewed board focus on repairing and building stronger links with Indigenous communities in the countries in which Rio operates. “Rigorous board oversight and governance will be crucial to achieving future progress in this regard.” The activist shareholder group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility welcomed Thompson and L’Estrange’s departures but said other directors including Sam Laidlaw should also consider their positions. Laidlaw, who chairs a remuneration committee that approved payouts for the departing executives, and another senior independent director, Simon McKeon, will lead Rio Tinto’s search for a permanent replacement for Thompson. “I am proud of Rio Tinto’s achievements in 2020, including our outstanding response to the Covid-19 pandemic, a second successive fatality-free year, significant progress with our climate change strategy, and strong shareholder returns,” Thompson said. “However, these successes were overshadowed by the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters at the Brockman 4 operations in Australia and, as Chairman, I am ultimately accountable for the failings that led to this tragic event.” ACCR’s legal counsel, James Fitzgerald, said that there was “no realistic prospect of Rio Tinto rebuilding its relationships and its reputation while those responsible for the degradation of its culture remained on its board”. “The departure of Thompson and L’Estrange suggests that Rio Tinto is also well aware of this. “News of their departure is welcome but other directors like Sam Laidlaw need to reflect on whether their continuing as directors is the interests of the company and its shareholders.” Labor’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Linda Burney, said Thompson’s acknowledgement that the destruction of Juukan Gorge was “a source of personal sadness and deep regret” was “important”. “I sincerely hope this acknowledgement is a further step towards substantive cultural change – not only within Rio Tinto, but the mining sector as a whole – which sees companies work more closely and constructively with Traditional Owners to ensure incidents like this never happen again.” L’Estrange’s review found Rio received four separate reports detailing the significance of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) in the years between receiving government approval to destroy the site in 2013 and detonating the blast last May. They included: a 2013 ethnographic survey stating the site was “of high significance to Puutu Kunti Kurrama, in the old days and still today”; a 2014 draft report of an archeological survey, paid for by Rio, which detailed signs of continuous occupation over 46,000 years including a 4,000 year-old hair belt which DNA testing revealed showed a direct genetic link to PKKP living today; the 2018 final report of that archeological survey which said the site has “the amazing potential to radically change our understanding of the earliest human behaviour in Australia”; and an ethnographic survey in 2020 further outlining the significance of the site to the PKKP. At a Senate inquiry last year, Rio Tinto’s vice-president of corporate relations in Australia, Brad Haynes, said no one in the senior executive team had read any of those reports before May 2020 “because we were always operating on the basis that there was consent”. At the same hearing, Jacques said Rio had not told the PKKP that it had considered, and dismissed, options for expanding the mine that would have left the sacred sites intact. Related: Rio Tinto boss admits destroying Juukan rock shelters 'was a dark day' and announces US$9.77bn profit The destruction of the site was outlined in a lengthy and complicated partnership agreement in 2011. Once permission to destroy the site was granted under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, it was removed as an obstacle from Rio’s operational maps. Evidence presented to the Senate inquiry showed the PKKP repeatedly voiced their concerns directly to the company. The partnership agreement contained non-disparagement clauses that prevented the PKKP from publicly expressing their concerns about the site. Minutes from meetings held by Rio in the days before the site was destroyed show that the company hired lawyers for a potential injunction against the PKKP in the event the gag clause was breached .

None,Former Rio Tinto CEO handed 20% pay rise despite caves scandal,Business,79,None,"The disgraced former chief executive of Rio Tinto was handed ?7.2m for last year, a pay rise of 20%, despite overseeing the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia. Jean-Sébastien Jacques agreed to step down from the mining company “by mutual agreement” with Rio Tinto’s board after the Juukan Gorge scandal last year, but the ousted mining boss will still take home his biggest ever pay packet for his time as chief executive. On top of the ?7.2m pay for last year, Jacques, who stepped down on 1 January, will take home ?519,000 for his remaining five months of unworked notice period this year, and ?215,000 for his unused leave. Other senior executives who stepped down in the wake of the Juukan scandal have also received financial benefits. Simone Niven, the head of corporate relations, and Chris Salisbury, the head of iron ore, were given “termination benefits” worth $1m and $1.3m respectively. Related: Rio Tinto to pay out record $9bn in dividends for 2020 The decision to blow up the rock shelters in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which were highly significant to the area’s Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people , was taken to help the Anglo-Australian miner access better-quality iron ore deposits. It led to an outcry from Indigenous Australian groups and investors, who denounced the board’s decision to dock Jacques’ pay by ?1m as inadequate, and to calls for Jacques to be removed as chief executive. Jacques was replaced at the start of the year by Rio Tinto’s former chief financial officer, Jakob Stausholm. Stausholm said the company has been “working to restore trust with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people”. “We are also developing additional measures to strengthen our partnerships with traditional owners in Australia, including a commitment to modernise and improve agreements in the Pilbara, home to our iron ore business,” he said. Related: 'Every day it's happening': Juukan Gorge inquiry told Aboriginal heritage is commonly destroyed In Rio Tinto’s annual report, the board said Jacques’ windfall was in large part due to the significant increase in the company’s share price after he became chief executive of the miner in 2016. The company’s market value has more than tripled in the last five years, to more than ?78.4bn, and for 2020 it handed shareholders a record payout of ?9bn, the highest in the company’s 148-year history . The company’s fortunes have improved in line with the rising price of iron ore, which is used to make steel, and copper for use in electricity infrastructure. The strong global demand for the metals has driven copper and iron ore prices to nine-year highs in recent weeks. Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said that allowing the destruction of the Juukan Gorge was “a breach of both our values and the trust placed in us” by the “traditional owners of the land on which we operate”. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk “In the months and years to come, we are determined to learn the lessons from Juukan Gorge, to rebuild the trust that has been lost, and to re-establish our leadership in environmental and social performance,” he said. “Today, shareholders are increasingly focused not only on the financial return that they can earn on their investment, but also on how that return is made. In order to build and maintain trust in Rio Tinto, we must seek to achieve environmental and social goals alongside generating profit for our shareholders.” The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility? (ACCR) said Rio Tinto’s handling of the disaster raises more questions about the fitness of its current board. The group has called on investors to “hold Thompson and other board members accountable” and insist on “necessary, constructive change to the company’s board composition so that the task of rebuilding community trustcan begin in earnest”.",2021/2/23 0:12,Respect|Integrity|Accountability|Ethical Responsibility,Recognition & Appreciation|Ethics & Compliance|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Organizational Trust & Inclusion,"{""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Organizational Trust & Inclusion"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""handed ?7.2m for last year, a pay rise of 20%"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""the board’s decision to dock Jacques’ pay by ?1m as inadequate"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""the destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge"", ""Organizational Trust & Inclusion"": ""a breach of both our values and the trust placed in us""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto boss admits destroying Juukan rock shelters 'was a dark day' and announces US$9.77bn profit,Australia news,87,None,"Rio Tinto needs to repair its standing in the community after its decision to blow up 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara so that it could mine more iron ore, the new chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, says. Stausholm on Wednesday night also committed BHP to reduce its scope 3 carbon emissions, which come from its customers, as part of a previously announced “ambition” to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The chief executive was delivering the company’s full-year profit result after last month replacing Jean-Sébastien Jacques who was among the executives to leave the company following the Juukan Gorge scandal. Related: Rio Tinto to pay out record $9bn in dividends for 2020 Rio’s profit soared 22% for 2020, to US$9.77bn (A$12.61bn), driven upwards by soaring iron ore prices despite increased costs due to the covid-19 pandemic and the rising Australian dollar. Stausholm said that earlier this week he visited Juukan Gorge to meet with traditional owners from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples and “personally expressed my deep regret for the damage we caused”. His visit came after a dispute between the PKKP and Rio over who at the company would handle repairing the damaged relationship between the two sides. The PKKP said they were reluctant to continue working with Rio, accusing the company of breaching an undertaking that iron ore boss Ivan Vella would handle the process. Earlier this month, Rio and the PKKP agreed to continue working together after the mining company admitted it had bungled the process. “For Rio, not only did we have to learn to live with the global pandemic, but the events at Juukan Gorge were a terrible chapter in Rio Tinto’s history,” Stausholm said. “Today let me reiterate, the rock shelters at Juukan should never have been touched. We should have dealt with the situation better. It was a dark day for Rio Tinto, for all our employees, and for me personally. It rightly caused considerable damage to many of our relationships, but in particular, with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, for whom it was a devastating breach of trust.” Stausholm said he and the Rio board were “very committed” to dealing with climate change. The company is following the lead set by key competitor Rio by committing to reducing scope 3 emissions – something Rio has in the past said is largely up to its customers. Stausholm said Rio would link emissions reductions to executive pay packets, and deliver a climate change report that will be put to a non-binding vote at its annual shareholder meeting next year. “Today we set out our first scope 3 goals, and a commitment to working with our customers – and their customers – to reduce emissions and decarbonise the production of certain metals,” he said. Related: Rio Tinto accepts it bungled communication with Juukan Gorge traditional owners The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents large pension funds, welcomed the move. “Climate change risks are deeply embedded across our economy and a significant challenge for Australian companies and investors,” CEO Louise Davidson said. “Investors need access to reliable and sufficiently granular information to understand companies’ exposure to physical and transitional risks. “Given the heightened exposure of the Australian economy to climate risk, there is increasing momentum from investors for a ‘say on climate’ and increased transparency around how companies are managing climate risk.”",2021/2/18 3:30,Accountability|Ethical Responsibility|Respect,Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Trust & Relationship Building,"{""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""a dark day for Rio Tinto"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""the damage we caused"", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""breach of trust""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto to pay out record $9bn in dividends for 2020,Business,76,None,"Mining company shareholders have hit paydirt this year after Rio Tinto became the latest miner to reveal an investor windfall of $6.5bn (?4.7bn) following a boom in commodity prices and soaring company share prices. Rio Tinto, the world’s second largest mining company, reported a 20% rise in underlying profit to $12.4bn after demand for iron ore climbed as China’s economy bounced back from the coronavirus lockdown last year. Rio Tinto’s better-than-expected profits followed a sharp increase in global commodity prices like iron ore and copper following interruptions to global supplies that were partly caused by the pandemic. The miner will pay out a final dividend of $5bn and a special dividend of $1.5bn, bringing its total 2020 payout to $9bn, the biggest in the company’s 148-year history. The investor windfall follows a record dividend payout from BHP , the world’s biggest mining company, which will hand investors $5.1bn shortly after becoming the most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange. Mining rival Glencore reinstated its dividend – after scrapping payouts last August – at $1.6bn. Mining company shareholders are in line for the record dividends after many stock market-listed companies in the sector doubled their market valuations in the last year following the steep increase in commodity market prices. The price of iron ore, which is the most important commodity for Rio Tinto, rose last year to its highest levels since 2011 as China’s economy recovered faster than expected. That recovery led to greater demand for steel at a time when production of iron ore was disrupted in Brazil. Commodity prices are also being driven up by hopes that governments around the world will invest in building projects to help restart economies after the pandemic. BHP’s market value has more than doubled from lows in March last year to almost ?124bn, beating Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever to the top of the FTSE 100. Glencore’s market capitalisation has climbed from ?112.50 a share last March to highs of ?289.85 this year. Rio Tinto’s share price has climbed from ?29.68 a share to ?62.68 a share over the same period. Rio Tinto’s investor payout was bigger than expected as the group dealt with the fallout from the destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Australia’s Pilbara region last year. The anger following the destruction of the sacred site at Juukan Gorge led to Jean-Sébastien Jacques being replaced by Jakob Stausholm as chief executive. Unveiling his first set of full-year results, Stausholm said: “It has been an extraordinary year – our successful response to the Covid-19 pandemic and strong safety performance were overshadowed by the tragic events at the Juukan Gorge, which should never have happened. “My new executive team and wider leadership of the company are all committed to unleashing Rio Tinto’s full potential. We will increase our focus on operational excellence and project development and strengthen our [environmental and social] credentials. “We must earn the right to become a trusted partner for traditional owners, host communities, governments and other stakeholders, but we all recognise that this will require sustained and consistent effort.”",2021/2/17 20:42,Performance|Agility|Execution|Collaboration,Shareholder & Investor Returns|Financial Performance & Profitability|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators|Market Valuation & Economic Outlook|Leadership & Change Transition|Operational Efficiency & Performance|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment,"{""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""positive"", ""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""positive"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""positive"", ""Market Valuation & Economic Outlook"": ""positive"", ""Leadership & Change Transition"": ""negative"", ""Operational Efficiency & Performance"": ""positive"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""positive""}",1,"{""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""Rio Tinto to pay out record $9bn in dividends for 2020"", ""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""reported a 20% rise in underlying profit to $12.4bn"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""following a boom in commodity prices and soaring company share prices"", ""Market Valuation & Economic Outlook"": ""BHP’s market value has more than doubled from lows in March last year to almost ?124bn"", ""Leadership & Change Transition"": ""The anger following the destruction of the sacred site at Juukan Gorge led to Jean-Sébastien Jacques being replaced by Jakob Stausholm as chief executive"", ""Operational Efficiency & Performance"": ""increase our focus on operational excellence and project development"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""become a trusted partner for traditional owners, host communities, governments and other stakeholders""}",The Guardian
lkngg9,"Former PLTR Engineer DD Part #2: Usability, Deployabilty, Scalability, &amp; Submersibility + My Lockup Plan",Ada_Diamonds,6502,997,"Honestly, this DD requires a lot of critical thinking. If that’s not your jam, please enjoy this cartoon of Alex Karp crushing the competition, then scroll down to the bottom of the DD where you’ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis, a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis.

[ \(photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex-Palantir designer u\/gottacroe and my wife u\/LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein\)](https://preview.redd.it/alrclog6jph61.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccc3ebfc134179b868459db097dd9d1e51534c1)

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser S?ze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

&gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

&gt;*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&amp;#x200B;

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

None,Juukan Gorge traditional owners say they are reluctant to continue dealing with Rio Tinto,Business,87,None,"The traditional Aboriginal owners of Juukan Gorge, which mining giant Rio Tinto knowingly destroyed in order to access higher-grade iron ore, say they are reluctant to continue dealing with the company, accusing it of reneging on a key promise it made to rebuild their shattered relationship. In a letter to the company seen by Guardian Australia, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) say they learned of an executive reshuffle only through media reports and accused Rio Tinto of breaking a promise that iron ore boss Ivan Vella would be personally responsible for repairing trust. The PKKP say that for “consistency and balance” they had specifically asked for Vella to work with them, and at a meeting in November this was given “unequivocal” support by the chairman of the Rio Tinto board, Simon Thompson. Related: Rio Tinto waives $300,000 electricity bill to Arnhem Land school after error made public “We were thus shocked and surprised to hear via the media on Thursday morning that Mr Vella is being transferred to Montreal and Mr [Simon] Trott will fill the position of CEO Iron Ore, as two of a number of senior management changes,” PKKP Aboriginal corporation’s acting executive, Grant Wilson, wrote in the 2 February letter. Wilson said that after the meeting, many within the PKKP “retained deep-seated skepticism” about whether Rio Tinto was genuine in its desire to restore trust. However, “others in the group who staked much of their own personal credibility on making a case for reconciliation and trust” prevailed, he said. “Through Ivan Vella and team, PKKP believed commitments to progress were beginning, but now PKKP is left to consider how it will respond to this latest in many disappointments, and whether trust in Rio Tinto can ever be realised. “PKKP is reluctant to participate in a relationship of this nature any longer, and I hope you understand that other stakeholders may take a similar approach.” Rio Tinto’s destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia in May 2020 caused international furore, prompted a federal parliamentary inquiry and saw the removal of three top executives, including the global boss, Jean Sebastien-Jaques. Last week Rio Tinto’s board announced a new executive structure – which Aboriginal native title groups described as “PR spin” they were not confident would lead to “meaningful change”. When contacted by Guardian Australia, the PKKP Aboriginal corporation said it had been in contact with Rio Tinto recently but “would not comment on the specific nature of any correspondence or discussions”. Rio Tinto says rebuilding the relationship with the PKKP remains a priority. A company spokesperson said: “We value an honest and open dialogue with the PKKP as this is critical to all enduring relationships. Rightly, the relationship with all traditional owners in the Pilbara, including the PKKP, is led by the chief executive of the iron ore business. We are confident that ongoing engagement with the PKKP will help maintain the momentum built over recent months.” Related: Rio Tinto addresses ‘hurt and devastation’ of Juukan Gorge blast as remedial works begin But the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility accused Rio Tinto of making an “elementary and entirely avoidable blunder”, which the PKKP could reasonably see as evidence that “the company still views its relationship with traditional owners as an afterthought”. “Thompson has just personally made the task of restoring trust and good relations with the PKKP much harder for responsible Rio Tinto staff,” the centre’s general counsel, James Fitzgerald, said. “Sadly, it now appears to fall on the PKKP themselves to deliver a masterclass in respect and good community relations practice to the company’s top leadership. Meanwhile, Indigenous groups around the world watch on with interest.” The $52bn superannuation fund Hesta, which has been a leading critic of the company among institutional investors, said last week that the reshuffle could help the company change its governance and culture. “Companies that fail to negotiate fairly and in good faith with Indigenous communities represent a clear systemic risk to investors,” Hesta’s chief executive, Debby Blakey, said. Rio’s progress on improving its governance and culture would “inform our share voting at Rio’s AGM in May”, Blakey said.",2021/2/4 16:30,Respect|Collaboration|Accountability,Trust & Relationship Building|Team Collaboration & Communication|Governance in Practice & Apology|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""negative"", ""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""negative"", ""Governance in Practice & Apology"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""reluctant to continue dealing with Rio Tinto"", ""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""learned of an executive reshuffle only through media reports"", ""Governance in Practice & Apology"": ""accusing it of reneging on a key promise"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""learned of an executive reshuffle only through media reports""}",The Guardian
None,"Rio Tinto waives $300,000 electricity bill to Arnhem Land school after error made public",Business,77,None,"Rio Tinto has waived a miscalculated $300,000 electricity bill to a primary school in Arnhem land, one day after the bill was made public. The ABC reported on Sunday that Nhulunbuy primary school, about 650km east of Darwin, owed the mining giant $300,000 in underpaid electricity bills. A spokeswoman from the NT Department of Education said the underpayment was detected by Rio Tinto and it notified the school in mid-2020. The accidental debt was accrued in just over two years, with the bill miscalculated between December 2016 and April 2019, the department said. The story prompted a wave of criticism of Rio Tinto on social media. It comes just days after the company announced a reshuffle intended to “focus on rebuilding trust and strengthening external relationships across Australia” after the destruction of the ancient Juukan Gorge rock shelters in Western Australia. Related: 'Rio is still on notice': native title groups say mining company's reshuffle is mainly PR The reshuffle was announced by the new global CEO, Jakob Stausholm, whose predecessor, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, resigned over the Juukan Gorge incident . A spokesman for Rio Tinto told Guardian Australia on Monday that the company had decided to waive the miscalculated electricity costs. “Upon review and consideration with the Northern Territory Department of Education, Rio Tinto will waive past power costs that were inaccurately billed to the Nhulunbuy primary school,” he said. “We understand how important accurate information on costs are to local partners and will work hard to prevent any such billing errors in the future.” The education department said the school had previously negotiated a payment plan with Rio Tinto, which the company agreed to, but was contacted by Rio to say the bill would be waived. “The department is appreciative of the goodwill extended by Rio Tinto and thank them for waiving the bill,” a spokeswoman said. Rio Tinto had been providing electricity to the school for 48 years. Brynn O’Brien, from the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said it was “difficult to understand” why Rio Tinto had not waived the bill immediately, “given the pressure they are under to improve their relationships with communities”. “This is not going to do their reputation any favours as they seek to move on from the Jacques era,” O’Brien said. The National Native Title Council has previously said that Rio Tinto was “still on notice” with regard to its treatment of First Nations people and heritage , and described the reshuffle announcement – which did not make reference to the company’s management of Indigenous heritage – as “a bit of PR spin”.

None,"Rio Tinto did not notify pastoral leaseholder of plans to destroy nearby Juukan Gorge, inquiry hears",Business,69,None,"The owner of a pastoral lease near Juukan Gorge had to fight for several years to find out anything about Rio Tinto’s plans for a mining expansion in the area, a federal inquiry into the miner’s destruction of the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal sacred site has heard. The owner of the Cheela Plains pastoral lease, which covers half a million hectares of land bordering Rio Tinto’s Brockman 4 mine, said he was surprised the site was destroyed because it had been known since 2014 it was significant. “Dealings with Rio Tinto since the 1970s have been very poor,” Evan Pensini told the inquiry at public hearings in Karratha on Monday. Related: Rio Tinto vows to stop blocking traditional owners in Pilbara from speaking out against heritage destruction “In 2006 [when the mine expansion was granted Western Australian government approval] at no point were we notified. Between 2008 and 2010, we tried to find out what Rio Tinto’s intentions were for the mine and pastoral lease.” In 2011, Pensini said his lawyer had to use freedom of information legislation to access documents about the mine, “because Rio Tinto would not come forward”. “Prior to us really taking a tough stance in 2011, Rio Tinto didn’t want to tell us anything about the mine,” he said. Since 2017, Pensini said the relationship had improved with middle management at Rio Tinto, but the right balance is yet to be struck between resource extraction and the natural landscape. “The area in question around the mine is a part of the country that has been special to me since I was young,” Pensini said. “We have our goals as pastoralists to look after the land, to pass it on to future generations in better shape than we found it. That has been our goal since the 1970s, so our bond and respect for the land is great. “What we’ve seen … is the mineral resources are the target and the natural aspect of the land is something that’s forgotten,” he said. “Our preservation of the pastoral lease is under threat.” Pensini said he had known about the significance of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge since heritage surveys – paid for by Rio Tinto – were done in 2014. He said he assumed that Rio Tinto knew as well. “They just gave us a footprint map that said where [the pit] was going to be. I knew the shelters were in the vicinity, I just presumed there was no way they’d mine over the top of them,” he said. Inquiry chairman Warren Enstch asked: “So you’d really have to be from another planet not to know there was something there?” “Correct,” Pensini said. He said the Cheela Plains pastoral lease is “literally covered in exploration leases, mining leases or special purpose leases, from small prospectors to large mining companies, so we will get notification of prospecting, surveys, drilling, whatever sent through the mail, then are given a time period to object or ask for more info”. “We physically cannot stop anything unless it is destroying part of our infrastructure. Apart from that we don’t have any control.” Robe River Kuruma Aboriginal Corporation CEO Sarah Slattery told the inquiry that they spend the majority of their time and resources dealing with dozens of mining company requests at once in an unequal relationship and under existing heritage legislation, “we can never say no”. “I would say we don’t make much money at all out of mining,” Slattery said, adding that it was a misconception that Aboriginal people have grown “rich” from royalties. The cumulative impact of mining is hard to manage, she said. “Not only Rio, we have everybody else out on country,” Slattery said. “And we are worried about what will be left for our children and grandchildren; there will be nothing left for them.” Earlier in the day, the committee spoke in private with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners of Juukan Gorge for several hours, before holding public meetings in the afternoon.

None,"Rio Tinto still has 1,780 approvals to destroy Aboriginal sacred sites, Juukan Gorge inquiry told",Australia news,65,None,"The mining giant Rio Tinto still holds 1,780 approvals to destroy Aboriginal sacred sites in the Pilbara, senior executives have told a parliamentary inquiry into the company’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred site at Juukan Gorge in May. The 1,780 approvals remain valid while Western Australia’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws are being reviewed, which means the company can legally destroy the sites. But the executives said every one of them was being reviewed for their “potential impact”, in partnership with the traditional owners. Rio’s global chief, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, its iron ore boss, Chris Salisbury, and its corporate affairs boss, Simone Niven, gave evidence to the Australian inquiry for a second time on Friday under very different circumstances from their first appearance in August. All three are stepping down over the company’s handling of the destruction of a 46,000-year-old rock shelter at Juukan Gorge, deemed to be of the highest archaeological significance in Australia – an example of industry conduct the WA Labor senator Pat Dodson labelled “incremental genocide”. Jacques said none of them had been aware of the site’s “extreme archaeological and cultural significance” until after it was destroyed, although “they should have been”. But he said others in the company had known since 2005. In tense and awkward exchanges with MPs, Jacques, Salisbury and Niven took responsibility for “missed opportunities” and “poor decisions” over several years that led to the destruction of the caves. “The explosion should not have occurred,” Salisbury said. “[The caves] should not have been included in the mine plans. There was no intent of deception, but clearly mistakes have been made. “We have no precise clarity about who made that decision [to include the caves in the the mine plan]. It was a poor decision and it was wrong.” Related: Rio Tinto vows to stop blocking traditional owners in Pilbara from speaking out against heritage destruction Salisbury said Rio hadn’t told the Puutu Kunti Kuurama and Pinikura peoples about its blast plans because “we believed we had consent”. After the PKKP pleaded at the 11th hour to stop the blast, Salisbury said it had been his decision to go ahead because removing the charges would have been too dangerous for employees on site, and “the safety of my employees is always my highest priority”. The WA Greens senator Rachel Siewert said she found it “mind-boggling” that the company could “just write off 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage like that, just write it off. Just unbelievable.” Rio’s general manager, Brad Welsh, said there was a moratorium on a 57sq km area around the Brockman 4 mine site, which would be an area of “perpetual protection”. Niven, responsible for Indigenous community relations since 2017, admitted that she had never once visited the site and had visited “maybe three or four” of Rio’s other Pilbara sites. She also revealed that the only meeting she had sought or held with the PKKP was after they had made a submission to the inquiry in late September. The explosion was a source of “great regret”, Niven said, about which “we did drop the ball”. The WA Liberal senator Dean Smith interrupted: “I think that understates the significance of what happened. “Do you take full responsibility or part responsibility for what happened?” he asked. Niven replied: “As I said, I’m stepping down. I take responsibility for the part I played, senator.” This week the PKKP spoke about how the blast had left them “devastated” . “Myself, my family, our elders and our ancestors are in mourning at the desecration of our sacred site,” said a traditional owner, Burchell Hayes. “The disaster has now left a gaping hole in our ability to pass on our heritage to our children and grandchildren. “When I heard, I was driving to Port Hedland with two of my grandsons. It felt terrible as a grandfather that I was not able to preserve the heritage that was on loan to me.” Related: 'Devastated' Indigenous owners say Rio Tinto misled them ahead of Juukan Gorge blast In August Rio Tinto told the inquiry it had considered three options for the mine that would have avoided damage to the rock shelters but had chosen a fourth to pursue an additional $134m in high-grade iron ore. On Friday Salisbury called that decision “a mistake”. The company confirmed it was working with the PKKP to set up a keeping place for artefacts and objects salvaged from the site, including a 4,000-year-old belt of plaited human hair that shows a direct genetic link to modern-day PKKP people. They are now being housed in a non-air conditioned shipping container on site. At the end of Friday’s session, Dodson was scathing in his assessment. “Anyone that’s been listening to this inquiry clearly gets the impression that the industry – and you’ve typified it to some degree – the lack of free prior and informed consent, the forcing of people into contracting out their rights, the management of culture that ties traditional owners and takes advantage of weak laws, would have to draw the conclusion that this is a form of incremental genocide, and the destruction of sites which is the evidentiary base of the oldest living culture in this country,” he said. “As an international company do you have any recollection that this is what you are currently, and have been, participating in?” After a pause, Jacques replied: “Senator, I can only restate how sorry we are. It should have never happened.”",2020/10/16 18:03,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Integrity|Learning|Collaboration,Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Environmental Governance & Accountability|Transparency & Disclosure|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Ethics & Compliance|Learning & Development|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Learning & Development"": ""positive"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.66,"{""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""Rio Tinto still has 1,780 approvals to destroy Aboriginal sacred sites"", ""Environmental Governance & Accountability"": ""destruction of a 46,000-year-old rock shelter at Juukan Gorge"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""Rio hadn’t told the Puutu Kunti Kuurama and Pinikura peoples about its blast plans"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""Jacques said none of them had been aware of the site’s “extreme archaeological and cultural significance”"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""the company can legally destroy the sites"", ""Learning & Development"": ""every one of them was being reviewed for their “potential impact”"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""Niven, responsible for Indigenous community relations since 2017, admitted that she had never once visited the site"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""the destruction of the caves. “The explosion should not have occurred,”""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto vows to stop blocking traditional owners in Pilbara from speaking out against heritage destruction,Business,91,None,"Rio Tinto has written to Aboriginal traditional owners in the Pilbara promising to work with them “based on respect, transparency and mutual benefit” ahead of its second appearance at a federal parliamentary inquiry into the company’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred site at Juukan Gorge in May. The letter, sent to several traditional owner groups including the Puutu Kunti Kuurama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP), whose sacred site Rio Tinto obliterated, said the company knew it had “much work to do to rebuild the trust of the traditional owners on whose land we operate”. Related: 'Devastated' Indigenous owners say Rio Tinto misled them ahead of Juukan Gorge blast Rio Tinto promised to “modernise” their agreements by “not enforcing” so-called gag clauses, which have prevented Aboriginal people from speaking publicly about the destruction of their heritage. It also pledged not to enforce clauses that would stop traditional owners applying for statutory protection of any cultural heritage sites. PKKP Aboriginal Corporation told the parliamentary inquiry on Monday that in the nine days of “absolute hell” leading up to its destruction of Juukan Gorge, Rio Tinto warned them they were bound by such a clause and could not apply for a federal emergency halt to works without first asking Rio Tinto ’ s permission and giving 30 days’ notice. “What we were reminded of by Rio’s lawyers was that we were not able to engage seeking out an emergency declaration that perhaps would have stopped proceedings, because of our claim-wide participation agreement,” the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation chief executive, Carol Meredith, told the inquiry. The letter also commits the company to reassessing activities that have the potential to impact cultural heritage sites, and more regular consultation – especially when new information about the importance of a site is found. Rio Tinto says it is considering the potential public release of its deals with traditional owners in the interests of greater transparency. The content of the agreements Aboriginal people have signed with Rio and other mining companies has been under scrutiny at the inquiry. Legal experts expressed concerns that traditional owners may have contracted away existing rights under the law. Related: Rio Tinto kept loading explosives at Juukan Gorge after promising to stop, traditional owners say Greg McIntyre SC, an executive member of the Law Council and a leading native title barrister, told the inquiry there was “no real justification” for legacy agreements between mining companies and traditional owners to remain confidential. Because the parties were not operating on a level playing field, the agreements should be revisited, he said, particularly where they may contain clauses that impinge on, or remove, other legal rights traditional owners might have. “There should be statutory provision which prevents the contracting out of rights,” said McIntyre, who led Eddie Mabo’s legal team in the Mabo case from 1982-1992. He agreed that native title bodies were under-resourced. “Some [prescribed body corporates] can barely afford a phone,” he said. Rio Tinto will appear before the inquiry on Friday for the second time – the first since its three senior executives stepped down over the company’s handling of the Juukan Gorge disaster. BHP, meanwhile, has avoided a shareholder vote calling on the company to immediately stop mining that could “disturb, destroy or desecrate” Aboriginal cultural heritage sites, after it struck a deal with the First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance to commit to improved practices. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which proposed the resolution, said the agreement was struck at the 11th hour, after the BHP chairman, Ken MacKenzie, became involved in negotiations with Aboriginal leadership. “Our relationships with traditional owners are among the most important that BHP has,” MacKenzie said at the annual general meeting. “I look forward to our continuing partnership to deliver the commitments we have made together, and our shared objectives.” Related: Fortescue urged to front MPs after two days of 'damning' evidence to Juukan Gorge inquiry The First Nations Heritage Protection Alliance confirmed the deal but said BHP “has a very long way to go in meeting best-practice standards in cultural heritage protection”. The National Native Title Council, a member of the alliance, said BHP had committed to strengthen free, prior and informed consent in agreement-making and support federal and state cultural-heritage law reform. The council’s chief executive, Jamie Lowe, said that was the first step for BHP on a very long journey towards best practice. “Frankly, these commitments, though strongly welcomed, represent the very minimum expectations that should have been common practice in Australia decades ago,” Lowe said. “Mining companies and Australian governments have got a long way to go.”",2020/10/15 14:52,Ethical Responsibility|Integrity,Ethical Investment & Responsible Business|Legal & Regulatory Integrity,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""negative"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""Rio Tinto has written to Aboriginal traditional owners in the Pilbara promising to work with them “based on respect, transparency and mutual benefit” ahead of its second appearance at a federal parlia"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""Legal experts expressed concerns that traditional owners may have contracted away existing rights under the law.""}",The Guardian

The PKKP have released a video about the site, which includes footage of the extent of the devastation, filmed in September. Traditional owners are visibly distressed as they stand at the site where the two Juukan caves have been reduced to rubble. “Myself, my family, our elders and our ancestors are in mourning at the desecration of our sacred site,” PKKP traditional owner Burchell Hayes told a federal parliamentary inquiry into the incident. “The disaster has now left a gaping hole in our ability to pass on our heritage to our children and grandchildren. “When I heard, I was driving to Port Hedland with two of my grandsons.

Related: Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge rock shelters 'to access higher volumes of high-grade ore' “The whole time we were under the impression they were trying to undertake mitigating actions to save the shelter or lessen the blast,” the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation’s (PKKPAC) chief executive, Carol Meredith, said. But 40% of the blast holes drilled around the gorge, including those closest to the rock shelters, were loaded with explosives after Rio had agreed to delay blasting on 15 May. The PKKP hired lawyers ready to lodge an injunction or an emergency appeal under federal heritage legislation, but they abandoned the plan after Rio Tinto told them the explosives could not be removed safely and had to be detonated. Hearing that news was “the nail in the coffin”, Meredith said. “The elders realised there was going to be a blast. And then we prepared for the grieving.” The company did remove some of the explosives from blast holes – at three sites it did not have legal permission to destroy – raising questions about whether Juukan Gorge could have been saved. “Rio said it wasn’t safe to remove the ones behind the rock shelters, but they determined it was safe to remove the ones adjacent to those three additional sites,” Rick Davis, a legal adviser to the PKKP, said. Rio Tinto told the inquiry in August it considered three options for the mine that would have avoided damage to the rock shelters, but chose a fourth to pursue an additional $134m in high-grade iron ore. Its CEO and two other executives have since resigned over the incident. But the PKKP said Rio Tinto only ever presented them with one option – to explode the site. “Rio certainly did not advise there were four options. That was only discovered when we heard it at this inquiry,” Meredith said. “So there has been some shock at hearing that. There was only one option presented to the group, and that included blasting Juukan Gorge.” The PKKP representatives also said Rio Tinto had known since at least 2013 that the caves were “of the highest significance”. Heritage manager Heather Builth said Rio Tinto’s section 18 application – where resource companies are given legal permission by the WA government to destroy Aboriginal sites – had been “a farce” that omitted crucial information the company already knew about the significance of the site. Builth also has concerns about the safety of the highly significant cultural materials salvaged from the caves, including a 4,000-year-old belt of plaited human hair that shows a direct genetic link to modern-day PKKP people. “The objects are being held in a sea container that goes from 7C to 60C on a daily basis. We are really worried about their condition,” Builth said. “We don’t have access [to them] because all of these items are stored on Rio Tinto property.” While Rio Tinto has released a new access protocol in the last week, Builth said, the traditional owners haven’t been allowed onsite since 2014. Related: Rio Tinto blasts 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand iron ore mine “We will recover what we can from the rubble of Juukan Gorge,” Burchell Hayes said. “We will do what we can to keep that anchor to our ancestors and as reminder of how fragile heritage is, at the hands of those who do not care about it as we do.” It is the first time the PKKP have spoken publicly. Because of a “gag clause” in their agreement with Rio Tinto, they had to seek permission from the company to speak to the inquiry without repercussion. “[The agreement] may have been the gold standard when it was signed but its flaws are very apparent. It wasn’t an equal partnership then and it isn’t now,” Meredith said. “We are very much feeling that we are up against a huge machine,” she said. She said the PKKP are seeking to change this “David and Goliath situation”. “We are acutely aware we may have been contracted out of our statutory rights to freedom of speech.” LNP senator Warren Entsch, the inquiry chair, replied: “They had you well and truly stitched up.” Entsch said the inquiry still intends to travel to the Pilbara in November to sit down with elders and view the site firsthand. They have been prevented from visiting by WA’s strict Covid-19 border closures. Entsch said he has written to the WA premier, Mark McGowan, three times seeking permission to travel.

None,Letter reveals Rio Tinto urged transfer of powers to WA ahead of environment law review,Environment,48,None,"Rio Tinto wrote to the Morrison government last year urging it to act quickly to transfer environmental approval powers to the Western Australia government, before a major review of national environment laws was complete. The move came 10 months before the Coalition announced it planned to change the laws to set up “one-stop shops” at state level for environmental approvals, starting with Western Australia. The legislation was introduced in August when the review of the laws, by former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel, was still under way. Rio urged the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, to consider a bilateral approval agreement between the two governments “as a matter of priority”, according to a letter obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. The mining giant also had meetings with government officials on at least four occasions dating back to August 2019 at which reform of Australia’s environmental laws was discussed. Related: Rio Tinto kept loading explosives at Juukan Gorge after promising to stop, traditional owners say The letter was written by Rio’s then-iron ore chief, Chris Salisbury, one of the executives who stepped down after the company blew up a 46,000-year-old Indigenous heritage site in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. The letter refers to iron ore operations in that same region. In the 21 November 2019 letter, Salisbury said “duplicative” state and federal processes were causing delays and increased costs for the resources sector. He welcomed a speech by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a day before, signalling the government’s desire to further streamline environmental approvals. “For the reasons set out below, I would respectfully ask that the commonwealth consider as a matter of priority an approval bilateral agreement between the commonwealth and Western Australian governments,” Salisbury wrote. The letter goes on: “We do not consider the review of the EPBC Act needs to occur before such an agreement is entered into.” Salisbury wrote that although the statutory review was under way, national laws already provided a mechanism for the transfer of approval powers to states. He told Ley that WA’s environmental processes were “robust” and a deal between the federal and state governments would save costs and time for industry “without compromising environmental regulation”. Salisbury told Ley he had recently written to and met with the WA premier, Mark McGowan, about the same issue. Answers given to a Senate committee show federal environment officials had four meetings with Rio Tinto – on 27 August and 11 December 2019 and 6 March and 3 April 2020 – at which a bilateral approval agreement or reform of Australia’s environment laws were discussed. In July this year, on the day of the release of the interim report from the EPBC Act review, Ley announced the government would put a streamlining bill to parliament. But officials were instructed to begin drafting the bill 11 days before the review’s chair , Graeme Samuel, delivered his report. Rio Tinto’s iron ore projects were on a list of major projects the government announced in June would be “fast-tracked” and WA was the first state to signal it would pursue a bilateral approval agreement. Both governments said formal negotiations began in August. An environment department spokesman said the minister was not present at meetings its officials had with Rio Tinto and the company’s representations “did not play a role” in the bill before the parliament. Asked if the minister had further meetings with the company, a spokesman for Ley said: “The minister routinely meets with a broad range of stakeholders.” He added that the bill “reflects the interim findings of the Samuel review”. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company would not comment about meetings it had with government and declined to respond to a series of questions. He pointed Guardian Australia to the company’s April 2020 submission to the EPBC Act review and an October 2019 submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry which showed the company’s publicly-stated support for bilateral approval agreements. But Tim Beshara, the federal policy director of the Wilderness Society, said the company was “forum-shopping” for sign-off for its mines with the “lowest possible protections in place and before any independent review might suggest the protections are increased”. “When Rio Tinto is the one who gets to set the bar for what is acceptable damage to Australia’s natural and cultural heritage, we all lose,” he said. “It’s unconscionable that the Australian government, before, during and after the demolition of Juukan Gorge could be actively facilitating Rio Tinto’s future work program to go ahead with even lower standards than they are required to meet today.” Samuel’s interim report found Australia’s environment is in unsustainable decline and governments have failed to protect the country’s unique wildlife and habitats. His final report is due at the end of October. Conservationists have warned that the reforms the government is proposing would weaken already unsatisfactory protections.

None,"Rio Tinto kept loading explosives at Juukan Gorge after promising to stop, traditional owners say",Australia news,96,None,"The traditional owners of Juukan Gorge say Rio Tinto provided them with incomplete information, publicly misrepresented the level of consultation, incorrectly described the significance of Aboriginal heritage sites to government authorities, and continued to load explosives above the 46,000-year-old heritage site after promising to delay the blast. In a coldly furious submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation said the Puutu Kunti Kurrama Pinikura people were “experiencing great spiritual, emotional and physical pain” at the loss of the sites, which were destroyed in a mining blast by Rio Tinto on 24 May. “We are extremely angry that, over an extended period, Rio Tinto did not act on our input nor the input of specialist archaeologists and anthropologists relating to the cultural importance of the Juukan Gorge rockshelters,” the submission said. “We are also angry that, once we raised the alarm bells in the months and weeks leading up to the disaster, Rio Tinto ignored our requests and concerns. Related: Rio Tinto expected to destroy 124 more Aboriginal sites, inquiry told “In the days before the disaster, Rio Tinto kept loading charges around Juukan 1 and Juukan 2 and then only took steps to avoid blast damage to sites over which they did not have legal authority to destroy. “The Juukan Gorge disaster tells us that Rio Tinto’s operational mindset has been driven by compliance to minimum standards of the law and maximisation of profit. PKKP believes that this is reflective of the industry as a whole.” Rio Tinto has repeatedly said it could not remove the explosives from the site because the safety risk and environmental risk was too great . But the PKKP said they had since learned that 156 blast holes – 40% of the 382 drilled around the gorge, including those closest to the rockshelters – were not loaded with explosives until after the PKKP had requested, and Rio had agreed, that blasting be delayed on 15 May. The PKKP said it had hired lawyers with the view to lodge an injunction or an emergency appeal under federal heritage legislation, but decided not to go ahead because Rio said that delaying the blast could cause a safety risk. They learned after the caves had been destroyed that Rio Tinto had only attempted to remove explosives near sites that it did not have legal permission to destroy, and had not sought advice on the feasibility of removing explosives to protect the rockshelters. Richard Bradshaw, the lawyer for the PKKP, contacted the office of the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, on 20 May, and was told by a senior adviser, Jarrod Lomas, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act was the responsibility of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Bradshaw then called Ley’s office and flagged a possible emergency declaration under that act. He was told someone would call him back. No one did. He called Ley’s office again that afternoon, and was again told someone would call him. The next day, Bradshaw received an email from the commercial law firm Ashurst, which had been engaged by Rio Tinto to fend off a potential injunction , reminding the PKKP that under their agreement with the company they could not speak publicly, and could trigger the forfeiture of payments. A ‘grossly unequal’ negotiation Rio Tinto received permission from the WA government in 2013 to destroy the two rockshelters, which are on the western edge of its Brockman 4 iron ore mine. They sit in Juukan Gorge, named for a Puutu Kunti Kurraman who was also known as Tommy Ashburton. Juukan married Topsy Williams, a Pinikura woman. The gorge is on the western edge of the Hamersley Range in the Pilbara, 60km north-west of Mt Tom Price and about 300km inland of Karratha. It is 400 metres long and 70 metres wide, a tributary of the Purlykuti Creek, and part of a cultural landscape connected to a men’s ceremonial business. Under the PKKP’s initial agreement with Rio Tinto it waived the right to raise objections to an application to destroy heritage, or to raise concerns in the media. It said those agreements were the product of a “grossly unequal negotiating position” between the parties, in which the PKKP were advised not to request the protection of Juukan Gorge because it sat on an iron ore body. Rio said it would not pay the PKKP royalties because the mining lease was granted in 1964 – long before the native title claim was submitted in 2001. It then agreed that royalties would be paid for new mines including Brockman 4. The company revealed to the Senate inquiry last month that it was considering three options for the mine that would have avoided damage to the rockshelters, but chose a fourth to pursue an additional $134m in high-grade iron ore. Its CEO and two other executives have since resigned over the incident. Included in the announcement about the resignations was the claim that the board had “engaged extensively with … Traditional Owners”. The PKKP said the board has made no contact with them to date. The rockshelters, dubbed Juukan 1 and Juukan 2, were surveyed by an archaeologist paid for by Rio Tinto in 2014 and found to be of high archaeological significance. The most archaeologically significant site, which showed continual occupation through the last ice age and contained a 4,000-year-old hair belt that was a DNA match to PKKP living today, “has been completely destroyed by the blast”. Related: Rio Tinto: why the sacking of three executives isn't enough for mining investors The PKKP say they “totally reject” suggestions that they had, at any point, given free, prior and informed consent for the area to be destroyed. They also reject the premise of Rio’s mea culpa, which is that if the full significance of the sites had been known at the right levels of the company it would not have destroyed them. “It is convenient to assert that the Juukan disaster was a consequence of ‘missed opportunities’, but to do so ignores the facts,” the PKKP said. “The ‘material new information’ received by Rio Tinto after making the decision to extend the mine-plan was information which confirmed what Rio Tinto already knew. At the time Rio Tinto made the decision to extend the mine plan, Rio Tinto was aware that the Juukan 1 and Juukan 2 were sites of high significance, and it made its decision on the basis that its profit was of greater importance.” The archaeological and ethnographic surveys outlining the significance of the sites, dating back to 2003, were commissioned by Rio Tinto. The PKKP said the damage and hurt done to them by the destruction of the site was “incalculable.” “Within the PKKP family is an old lady,” the submission said. “She is in her late 90s and quite frail. She is the last remaining daughter of Juukan, and she named the gorge and the rock shelters on behalf of her father, who is a very respected ancestor of many. No one has told her that the rock shelters and Gorge have been lost as they all fear it will result in her passing. Everyone hopes she will never find out. “PKKP are in shock. The PKKP people feel betrayed. Nothing could prepare them for this.” The inquiry is due to hand down its final report on 9 December.",2020/9/25 19:51,Integrity|Accountability|Ethical Responsibility|Collaboration,Corporate Conduct & Professionalism|Transparency & Disclosure|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Legal & Regulatory Integrity,"{""Corporate Conduct & Professionalism"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""positive"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative""}",0.77,"{""Corporate Conduct & Professionalism"": ""Rio Tinto kept loading explosives at Juukan Gorge after promising to stop"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""provided them with incomplete information, publicly misrepresented the level of consultation"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""destroyed in a mining blast by Rio Tinto on 24 May"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""Rio Tinto ignored our requests and concerns"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""Rio Tinto had only attempted to remove explosives near sites that it did not have legal permission to destroy, and had not sought advice on the feasibility of removing explosives to protect the rocksh"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""Rio Tinto did not act on our input nor the input of specialist archaeologists and anthropologists""}",The Guardian

None,"Rio Tinto expected to destroy 124 more Aboriginal sites, inquiry told",Australia news,85,None,"An inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge has heard that Rio Tinto is expected to destroy another 124 Aboriginal heritage sites at a new iron ore development less than 100km away from the exploded rock shelters. Questions have also been raised over whether the approval granted by the WA government to destroy the 46,000-year-old sites in Juukan Gorge was valid. Related: More than 100 Aboriginal sacred sites – some dating before the ice age – could be destroyed by mining companies Rio Tinto destroyed the two ancient rock shelters on 24 May, on the basis of ministerial consent granted by the then WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Peter Collier, in 2013. The then premier, Colin Barnett, has recently called for a royal commission. Robin Chapple, a WA Greens MP, told the inquiry that Collier gave consent under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 on the basis of a recommendation from a meeting of the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee on 18 December 2013. That meeting ran for 50 minutes and considered 124 Aboriginal heritage sites, including the rock shelters known as Juukan 1 and 2. It was presided over by the chair of the committee, one committee member, and three ex-officio members. “There is a high likelihood that that recommendation to the minister was invalid,” Chapple told the joint standing committee on Northern Australia in a telephone hearing on Monday. “And the reason for that is the act specifies that only two members of that committee can be ex-officio when it comes to a quorum of five.” That means the state could be liable for a compensation claim from the traditional owners of Juukan Gorge, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people, Chapple said. The legislation states that the committee’s quorum should “not be less than five persons of whom two shall be ex-officio members.” A spokeswoman for the WA government said that “while not stipulated in the act, this is taken to mean a minimum of two ex-officio members”. The PKKP are already in confidential talks with Rio Tinto about compensation and guaranteeing further heritage protection. The area around Juukan Gorge, which the company decided not to avoid in order to access an additional $135m in high grade iron ore at its Brockman 4 mine , is now subject to a moratorium. South of the PKKP county, the Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation (YAC) is attempting to prevent the destruction of 124 Aboriginal heritage sites that are in the path of Rio Tinto’s Western Range deposit. Rio Tinto has already received section 18 approval to destroy 26 of those 124 sites, which YAC has no right to oppose. There are 327 heritage sites in that area alone. Rio announced in February that it discovered 200 million tones of iron ore at the site, which it is developing in a joint venture with China’s Baowu Group. Related: Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto hired lawyers for potential injunction against blasting of Aboriginal site Dr Anna Fagan, an archaeologist with YAC, told the inquiry that some sites in the Western Range could be as old as Yirra, a significant rock shelter on Yinhawangka country that is estimated to be at least 27,000 years old . She said the full age and significance of both Yirra and the Western Range sites would not be known without further archaeological work, which YAC does not have the resources to fund on its own. Mining companies only fund extensive archaeological surveys if it’s a salvage mission prior to the site being destroyed, as they did at Juukan Gorge. “We rely on Rio’s goodwill,” YAC chief executive Grant Bussell told the inquiry. “For example, for Yirra they have offered us some funding to continue with that. And I certainly believe that because of your inquiry and the failures that happened in PKKP country, they are more sensitive now and a little more careful around the protection of sites.” Bussell said he had heard “positive sounding statements out of Rio” but the company had yet to tell YAC they would review all active section 18 approvals over YAC land, and whether they would renegotiate cultural heritage agreements. BHP, Rio Tinto’s biggest competitor, has agreed to both. It is working to differentiate itself from Rio Tinto , which prior to the destruction of Juukan Gorge was considered the leading practitioner in protecting Indigenous heritage in Australia. Rio Tinto’s global chief executive, the Perth-based chief executive of its iron ore division and another executive resigned over the incident , which Chapple said was “what’s known in the Pilbara as a cluster, and I’ll let you finish the rest of the word”. In a statement provided after the hearing, Rio Tinto said it was currently undertaking a feasibility study on the proposed Western Range development, which included consultation with YAC. A Rio spokesperson said the company had taken steps to protect more than 250 of the 370 sites identified in the project footprint. They said the company was “committed to a process of modernising” its participation agreement with YAC, “including in relation to consent, to ensure the Yinhawangka People can raise concerns or objections relating to the impacts of our operations on their country”. “As part of the ongoing study work at Western Range, the remaining sites continue to be reviewed and assessed, with further section 16 excavations to be conducted with the Yinhawangka People, together with ethnographic consultations to build further understanding of the cultural significance and values placed on these sites by the Yinhawangka People,” the spokesperson said. “Consultation with the traditional owners will be integral to each stage of work.” Related: Rio Tinto CEO and senior executives resign from company after Juukan Gorge debacle Cedric Davies, a geologist who has worked with both native title groups and mining companies in the Pilbara, including Rio Tinto, said he “wasn’t shocked that Rio had obtained a section 18 consent; that kind of thing happens all the time. But I was shocked at the scale of the site that had been destroyed and I was shocked that it was Rio Tinto … they had so long been considered to be industry leaders and I couldn’t fathom what they were thinking”. “The events at Juukan exposed Rio behaving like the East India Company mark 2,” Davies said. “Ruthless asset stripping and shipping the profits overseas.” He said mining companies received privileged treatment in Western Australia, down to the speed with which they can expect a response from government departments, and that makes everything much harder for Indigenous groups. “If I ask for a map, if it’s for a mining company I usually get a map back within one or two days, with an apology if it’s later than that,” he said. “If I’m acting on behalf of an Indigenous group, it’s usually after follow-up emails weeks later.” Bussell said the new draft Aboriginal heritage legislation will not correct that imbalance. “I don’t see a single thing that would stop Juukan from happening again,” he said. “This is Western Australia. The mining industry is powerful. It’s a very good force for the country and for WA but when you bring it up against Aboriginal people and this remarkable heritage we have … you guys know as well as I know who is going to come out on top.” He said the minister should not have discretionary power to grant approval to destroy a heritage site unless it has gone through an independent review process through a body like the state administrative tribunal. Woodside operates gas plants on the Burrup peninsula among the world heritage nominated Murujuga Aboriginal cultural landscape, one of the oldest and most extensive areas of rock art in the world. It said it had not disturbed any heritage sites since 2007, and that rights of traditional owners to appeal the destruction of heritage should be “time bound and expedient” “But if more information comes into the table [after approval to destroy a site has been granted] we must deal with it, our policy requires it,” said Daniel Kalms, Woodside’s senior vice-president of corporate and legal.",2020/9/21 16:25,Accountability,Leadership Accountability,"{""Leadership Accountability"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Leadership Accountability"": ""Rio Tinto CEO quits after cave furore""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto: why the sacking of three executives isn't enough for mining investors,Business,85,None,"Rio Tinto has sacked three senior executives, including the global CEO, as penance for destroying a 46,000-year-old archaeological and sacred site in Western Australia’s Pilbara, but shareholder and Indigenous groups insist the move must signal the start of a major overhaul of the way all mining companies operate in the region. One of Australia’s biggest superannuation funds says the departure of CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques, head of iron ore Chris Salisbury, and corporate affairs chief Simone Niven won’t be enough to restore investor confidence. Hesta, which manages $52bn on behalf of more than 870,000 Australians, wants an independent review of all current agreements between the company and traditional owners, and says it is talking to major global investors to join them in lobbying the Rio Tinto board. Related: Rio Tinto CEO and senior executives resign from company after Juukan Gorge debacle “The nature of these agreements and how they are negotiated represents a systemic risk for investors that will not be mitigated by executive changes,” CEO Debby Blakey said. “The board has yet to adequately demonstrate to investors that they have appropriate governance and oversight arrangements in place to manage this risk.” Hesta’s concerns flow from revelations that many of the agreements between traditional owners and mining companies contain “gag clauses” preventing them from voicing concerns about heritage destruction. The agreements used by the three major mining companies – Rio Tinto, BHP and Fortescue Metals Group – are largely the same. Additionally, the WA Aboriginal heritage act does not give traditional owners the right to veto or even object to the destruction of their important sites. Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $175bn AustralianSuper, also sees the executive departures as merely a starting point. “Rio can now work with traditional owners to guarantee that its processes are appropriate for the protection of culturally important sites and that it has the right internal accountabilities,” chief executive Ian Silk said. “We will continue to take an active interest in how these changes are implemented.” One of Rio’s biggest global investors, Aberdeen Standard International, said the company needed to work on rebuilding trust with its stakeholders. “Our expectation is that oversight and accountability for cultural heritage management is elevated to the highest levels within Rio Tinto,” Aberdeen’s Camille Simeon said. “We expect a level of transparency that will afford investors the confidence that cultural heritage is being managed appropriately so that stakeholders can be confident that similar oversights do not recur.” The University of Melbourne academic, Prof Marcia Langton, who has advised several companies on Indigenous engagement , says transparency is essential. “We need to see those agreements. We need to make sure that there’s been no unconscionable conduct,” she said. “It is very much a part of the complex of problems that led to the destruction of the caves that the agreements are completely confidential and also include gag clauses. In no way can this be called a satisfactory partnership or legal arrangement.” Langton said Rio must now build a workforce with greater local knowledge, better able to engage with traditional owners to “establish the kinds of cultural heritage protection mechanisms that were recommended to them”. “We need to see them commit to employing experts in their company, not spin doctors and external relations people,” she said. Langton told ABC TV on Friday: “We’re [not] going to be satisfied with three scalps. How about the main problem? How about their utter incompetence in dealing with our cultural heritage?” ‘We will not allow this devastation to happen again’ After becoming CEO in 2016, Jacques cut the size of Rio’s Melbourne office, which is the company’s headquarters in Australia. He bought a house in Sydney. Rio itself was increasingly run from its global headquarters in London – a move some market observers say left executives increasingly out of touch with what was happening on the ground in the Pilbara, the source of the rich iron ore that drives the company’s profits. The company recognised its loss of engagement with Australia on Friday. At the same time as announcing the executive exits, it gave one of its non-executive directors special responsibility for oversight of its affairs in the country. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people are the native title holders for Juukan Gorge, where the ancient rock shelters were destroyed in May. They met with Jacques this week and are negotiating a permanent moratorium around mining at the site – and say they’ll continue to push for sector-wide changes. “We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again,” the PKKP Aboriginal council said. The WA treasurer and Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, also said Rio had lost connection with the Pilbara, where it generates 75% of its revenue. “That left them exposed when this crisis occurred. This isn’t a positive thing for Western Australia. I’m keen now for the board and the company to move on, learn the lessons that it needs to learn and become again the leader in those partnerships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people,” he said. But Wyatt won’t halt current mining company applications to destroy heritage under the WA act saying a moratorium was “a clumsy approach”. “A more sophisticated approach is one that we have been adopting, and that is requiring genuine engagement between the proponents,” Wyatt said. “The loss of those executives I suspect was inevitable. When the shareholders get involved, you often get a reaction from the board. But I suspect those shareholders haven’t finished in respect of what they want to see from the board. So there may be more changes.” The National Native Title Council said changes must be industry-wide. Related: Rio Tinto chair may want to rethink position over heritage site destruction | Nils Pratley “If this is the behaviour of a company thought to have sector-leading standards, what is the risk another Juukan Gorge-type incident will happen again, without sector-wide reforms? Traditional owners are not anti-economic development. They just want to be able to protect their most significant cultural heritage sites,” council CEO Jamie Lowe said. Rio culture ‘significant factor’ in sites’ destruction The political fallout is ongoing. The parliamentary inquiry set up to investigate the debacle welcomed news of Friday’s resignations. “The evidence received by the committee has made clear that the internal culture at Rio Tinto was a significant factor in the destruction of these sites,” inquiry chair, Queensland LNP MP Warren Entsch, said. “New leadership, new structures and new operating principles within the company are essential to preventing such catastrophes in the future.” Entsch said he hoped other mining companies would make similar commitments. Earlier this week, the parliamentary inquiry said Rio had misled its members. “It is hard to argue that we have not been misled by Rio Tinto’s evidence to the inquiry when you look at what was said together with the documents the company has provided on notice,” Entsch told Guardian Australia. “It is a profound statement to say that senior executives did not know when the company has been aware since the early 00s of the significance of the caves.” Entsch said Rio’s appearance before the inquiry raised more questions than it answered. A subsequent release of hundreds of pages of documents in response to the inquiry’s questions revealed that Rio’s senior management hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the destruction of ancient rock shelters in Juukan Gorge, three days before they were destroyed. This contradicted Jacques’ earlier public statements that senior executives did not know just how important Juukan Gorge was until after it was destroyed. Rio Tinto has been contacted for comment regarding Entsch’s allegations. Western Australian Greens senator Rachel Siewert said Rio’s decision should also put pressure on the federal and state governments to strengthen heritage protection laws. WA has released new draft laws which carry a $10m fine for unauthorised damage to a site , but rely on the same agreement-making processes already used by mining company’s negotiating with native title holders. They are supported by the mining industry. Changes to the Environmental Protection, Biodiversity and Conservation (EPBC) Act will allow state governments to make the decision for nationally-listed cultural heritage places such as the Fitzroy River. Investors want more than ‘business as usual’ “Mining companies are on notice they do not have the social license to destroy First Nations peoples’ heritage and culture,” Siewert said. That warning was echoed this week by ratings agency S&P which said investors would be looking for more than just technical compliance with the law.

Mining companies are taking notice. On Thursday, BHP announced it was setting up a heritage advisory council with Banjima native title holders to inform the design of its $4.5bn South Flank iron ore mining operation. Guardian Australia revealed in June that the Western Australian government had granted BHP permission to destroy 40 Aboriginal heritage sites belonging to the Banjima people, in order to progress its South Flank development. A further 46 sites identified as sacred by the Banjima did not meet the threshold for the WA Aboriginal cultural materials committee to register them as a site, meaning they could be destroyed or damaged without permission. Shareholders are also seeking accountability from Fortescue. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) wants FMG to halt mining activities that would disturb, destroy or desecrate cultural heritage sites until relevant laws are strengthened. “In engagement with us, FMG has been clear that it is happy for business to continue as usual. Shareholders, in the wake of Juukan Gorge, know that business as usual is absolutely unacceptable,” said the ACCR’s Brynn O’Brien. “FMG has a dubious history of engagement with Pilbara native title holders, specifically the Yindjibarndi people. Comments as recently as last year, coming from the chairman saying ‘That is not a community I’m going to empower with tens of millions of your cash’, demonstrate the company and board have a long way to go in understanding and valuing the intricacies of cultural heritage and the agency of traditional owners.” It’s like blowing up the tomb of the unknown soldier and forgetting about the occupant Prof Glynn Cochrane The ACCR has also sought similar assurances from BHP. Mining companies usually advise a vote against such shareholder resolutions, but BHP has left the door open to supporting it. For its part, FMG said it does not have heritage “gag order” clauses in its agreements with traditional owners and does not support a moratorium on mining activity. “The moratorium, proposed by people unfamiliar with the West Australian mining industry, is not supported by Fortescue as it would disempower local Aboriginal people in the Pilbara and limit the positive contribution the mining industry is making to the state and national economies, at a time when it is needed most,” the chief executive, Elizabeth Gaines, said. As the dust settles on Friday’s announcement, questions remain about the safety of 7,000 artefacts salvaged from the Juukan Gorge site. Rio admitted that a huge number are still sitting in a non-airconditioned shipping container on a mining site in the Pilbara. A latex peel taken from the wall of the oldest rock shelter has been on display in the Brockman 4 administration building since 2014. Related: Rio Tinto condemned by shareholders for seeking legal advice before blowing up Juukan Gorge Anthropologist Prof Glynn Cochrane, who spent 20 years implementing Rio Tinto’s social performance program, said: “It’s like blowing up the tomb of the unknown soldier and forgetting about the occupant.” “The traditional owners can access their material at any time by request,” the company said. “The reason that a request must be made is because the facility is located on an active mine site. We can repatriate anything and everything salvaged from PKKP country at any time should a request be made by the PKKP.” Langton said the PKKP and other traditional owners in the Pilbara must be given the power to decide how they want their cultural materials stored and reparations should also be made in the form they demand. “It’s very important that the most significant material taken from the destroyed sites is always available to the traditional owners, in a centre that’s dedicated to them,” Langton said. “But it is such a tragedy that we have to talk about the situation in these terms. What we need to do is stop the destruction of sites.”",2020/9/12 6:00,Ethical Responsibility,Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto CEO and senior executives resign from company after Juukan Gorge debacle,Business,89,None,"The Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and two other senior executives are leaving the global miner after its board bowed to intense investor pressure for strong action over its decision to blow up 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Rio Tinto said Jacques was leaving “by mutual agreement” with the board. The iron ore head, Chris Salisbury, and the corporate affairs boss, Simone Niven, will also depart, the company said on Friday morning. The move came after a week in which investors queued up to denounce as inadequate the board’s previous decision to cut the executives’ short-term bonuses in response to the scandal and the head of an Australian parliamentary committee looking into the affair raised concerns that the company had given the inquiry misleading evidence. Related: Hesta super says 'change in ranks' at Rio Tinto won't be enough as Juukan Gorge fallout continues Despite leaving the company all three would continue to be entitled to long-term bonuses, Rio Tinto said. The company blew up the rock shelters, which were highly significant to the area’s Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, in May, so that it could mine better quality iron ore, despite knowing for years of their importance. In response to an outcry from Indigenous groups and investors, Rio Tinto’s board conducted a review of the decision, which led to the reduction in bonuses. “While there is general recognition of the transparency of the board review and support for the changes recommended, significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified,” the company said. Investors have welcomed the decision. Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said he was “satisfied that appropriate responsibility has now been taken by executives at Rio Tinto”. “Rio can now work with traditional owners to guarantee that its processes are appropriate for the protection of culturally important sites and that it has the right internal accountabilities,” he said. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility welcomed an end to the “malaise of Rio Tinto’s board and senior management”, James Fitzgerald said. “Shareholder democracy and investor action is alive and well in Australia.” The National Native Title Council welcomed Rio’s actions but said the company must make “structural change” to make sure a disaster like Juukan didn’t happen again. “There is more work to be done,” said the NNTC’s chief executive, Jamie Lowe. “The law needs to be strengthened. We can’t rely on the goodwill of mining companies, we need the law strengthened. We can’t rely on their word that things will get better.” The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which advises 38 large super funds on governance issues, welcomed the departures but said the process had been “drawn out”. “Rio Tinto now has the opportunity to address the necessary remediation, cultural heritage and risk processes with fresh eyes,” said ACSI’s chief executive, Louise Davidson. “Rio Tinto must prioritise working with traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people to rebuild their relationship. It is critical that this is not delayed.” In a move that recognised that the board has lacked engagement with Australian issues, the company will also promote from non-executive director to senior independent director the executive responsible for oversight of its Australian-listed arm, Rio Tinto Limited. Sam Laidlaw will continue as senior independent director responsible for the British half of the group, Rio Tinto plc. Related: More than 100 Aboriginal sacred sites – some dating before the ice age – could be destroyed by mining companies Davidson said ACSI was pleased to see Rio Tinto’s board recognise it needed to be more connected to Australia. “This work will be ongoing and must be a feature of future appointments to the board. “We will also be looking closely at the separation arrangements, with the expectation that any exit won’t provide a windfall for executives on their departure.” Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, said: “What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation. “We are also determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. “We have listened to our stakeholders’ concerns that a lack of individual accountability undermines the group’s ability to rebuild that trust and to move forward to implement the changes identified in the board review.” Jacques will remain in his role until a successor is found or 31 March next year, whichever is earlier. Salisbury and Niven stepped down from their positions on Friday and will leave the company on 31 December. ?

None,Friday briefing: Rio Tinto CEO quits after cave furore,World news,80,None,"Top story: Jean-Sébastien Jacques to leave ‘by mutual agreement’ Hello, Warren Murray with news picked for you by these very hands (sanitised of course). The Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and two other senior executives have resigned after intense investor pressure over the mining company having blown up 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia . The Church of England’s pension board, which manages more than ?2.8bn ($AU5bn) in retirement savings, was among groups that poured pressure on the board of Rio Tinto to take action against its chief executive over the debacle. The Anglo-Australian mining company said Jacques was leaving “by mutual agreement” with the board, while its iron ore head, Chris Salisbury, and corporate affairs boss, Simone Niven, would also depart. Rio Tinto blew up the rock shelters , which were extremely significant to the area’s traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, in May so that it could mine more iron ore and despite knowing for years of their importance. * * * Sacoolas drove on wrong side – Lawyers for Anne Sacoolas have said the American “instinctively” drove on the “wrong side of the road for 20 seconds” before the fatal crash in which Harry Dunn was killed. The 43-year-old has issued a public statement saying she flagged down help, called for police and stayed to help at the scene. The motorcyclist was killed in the crash last year outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire where Sacoolas’s husband worked for US intelligence. US authorities asserted Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity and, according to her lawyers, “[the US embassy] informed the Foreign Office of this decision and instructed Anne to return home”. Dunn’s parents said they noted the statement but “once again they invite her to do the right thing and return to the UK to answer to the charges laid against her”. Dunn’s family have filed a US lawsuit against Sacoolas. * * * Row rages over internal markets – A rift has emerged between the government’s top legal advisers over the legislation to override the EU withdrawal agreement. Their advice, seen by the Guardian, appears to show that Richard Keen, the advocate general for Scotland, advised ministers would be breaching the ministerial code if they defied international law. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, and solicitor general, Michael Ellis, disagreed, though the letter states that all three agreed the internal market bill would amount to a “clear breach” of the withdrawal agreement and international law . Brexit talks appear to be on the point of collapse after Britain flatly rejected an EU ultimatum to back down within three weeks or face sanctions . The committee stage of the bill is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday after the second reading on Monday. It may face a battle in the Lords where senior Tories have been vocal in their dissent . * * * Plight of Moria refugees – Plumes of smoke rise above the ashes and twisted metal – all that remains of Europe’s largest refugee camp, Moria on Lesbos, which was home to thousands of children and their families before devastating fires this week . Across the island the fire has caused anger, indignation and despair, and divided the community on what should come next. Some local people express solidarity with the refugees but many hope that the camp will not be rebuilt. The mayor of Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, Stratis Kytelis, is among those opposing a new camp and told local media that he will not accept any reopening of Moria. Refugees at the smaller Kara Tepe camp nearby have been sharing food and offering consolation but for now the thousands who fled Moria have nowhere to go. * * * Anger behind the mask – Lockdown rules and mask-wearing are causing deeper social fractures than Brexit, a poll of 10,000 people has found. The masked (58%) have severely negative attitudes towards the non-masked , and the majority (68%) of people who obey lockdown rules feeling strongly negative views towards those who break them. Significant minorities of people who stick to rules say they “hate” or “resent” people who do not, says the Demos thinktank. Hotels and restaurants have been hit by a wave of cancellations as new coronavirus restrictions throw Christmas celebrations into doubt . The festive season is when many retailers bank the lion’s share of their annual profits, while socialising in the run-up to Christmas and new year brings Britain’s pubs, restaurants and hotels up to 40% of their annual profits. Head to our global coronavirus live blog for further developments. * * * US reels amid wildfires – More than 500,000 people in Oregon, amounting to more than 10% of the population, have been forced to evacuate as unprecedented wildfires rage across the state. Overnight the president, Donald Trump, made an emergency declaration approving federal assistance. Wildfires in the American west have killed at least 15 people and levelled entire neighbourhoods. In Oregon fire conditions not seen in three decades have fuelled huge blazes that have killed at least three people and destroyed at least five towns. In Washington state a one-year-old boy died after his family was apparently overrun by flames trying to flee a wildfire; while in northern California’s Butte county at least 10 people have died and 16 are missing. * * * A woman at top of Wall St – Citigroup has appointed the Scottish-American banker Jane Fraser as its next chief executive , the first time a big Wall Street bank will be led by a woman. Fraser, who has worked there for 16 years, will take over from Michael Corbat in February. Fraser was born in Scotland and studied economics at Cambridge and Harvard before working at Goldman Sachs in London followed by other roles across the world. Citigroup is one of the world’s biggest banks, with assets worth more than $2.2tn (?1.7tn) on its balance sheet at the end of June.

None,Rio Tinto chair may want to rethink position over heritage site destruction,Business,65,None,"Here’s a rule of thumb for boards in a crisis: if your company’s reputation is still being shredded three weeks after you tried to put a lid on events, you probably got your response wrong. Rio Tinto’s board did. Having confessed in an internal report that “systemic failures” lay behind the blowing up of two 46,000-year-old Indigenous Australians rock shelters in western Australia in May, the non-executive chairman, Simon Thompson, proceeded to argue that nobody at the mining group should have to resign. Instead, three executives deemed to carry “partial responsibility” for the appalling error suffered a trim in their pay pockets. A collective ?4m penalty was, presumably, intended to wow the outside world, but the numbers were never likely to have that effect. Jean-Sébastien Jacques, the chief executive, was docked ?2.7m in bonuses, a tolerable inconvenience when you’ve been paid ?17m in the past four years. In any case, rather than bonus deductions, many Australians wanted to see proper accountability. Jacques admitted he hadn’t read the report that warned of the shelters’ significance until it was too late, so one “systemic failure” was corporate incompetence in not booting a critical document up the chain of command. On the other hand, shouldn’t a competent boss install strong reporting systems? The same internal report rather suggested so: “As chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques is ultimately responsible for the group’s cultural heritage management,” it said. The result is a fine mess. Hostile headlines and questions in the Australian parliament have kept coming. Many investors – and not just the “socially responsible” contingent – feel a top 10 FTSE 100 company should have responded more forcefully. Rio stands somewhere between laughing stock in Australia (the former prime minister Kevin Rudd refers to “Rio TNT”) and target of outright hostility. Both are problems when your core division requires land rights to dig up chunks of the Pilbara desert for its iron ore. The board will meet to rethink. That doesn’t sound good for Jacques’ hopes of surviving. Mind you, Thompson should also ask himself if he’s the right chairman. Solid but hardly a supermarkets’ renaissance “I believe we are seeing the renaissance of British supermarkets,” declared David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons. It’s a bold claim to make when your half-year profits have just fallen by 25% and your share price, like your rivals’, is becalmed. One can see what he’s getting at, of course. Morrisons et al have performed well during the pandemic. Tens of thousands of new employees have been hired and the shelves never seriously ran short of stock, which didn’t feel 100% guaranteed in March. It is why there is no political pressure on supermarkets to return the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s freebie on business rates (worth ?93m to Morrisons over four months) even though the stores remained open. The nation is seen to have got something for its money – Morrisons put extra direct costs from Covid at ?155m. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The old guard have also reclaimed some market share from discounters. And they’ve learned new tricks in a hurry, ramping up online delivery capacity, something they should probably have been doing anyway. Does this amount to a renaissance, though? When talking to his shareholders, Potts may be wise to set sights a little lower. A revival of the industry’s good old days of easy growth and fat profit margins (good, that is, for the chains rather than the shoppers) is not on the cards. Aldi and Lidl, the price police, remain on the beat. Online is also less profitable than obliging customers to do the time-consuming slog. Morrisons could, though, claim to have demonstrated resilience in spades. Potts didn’t quibble with City analysts’ forecasts that pre-tax profits over the full-year will rise 6% to ?432m as pandemic costs fade. That would be a decent outcome amid the upheaval. The half-year dividend was improved by the same percentage. Come next March, special distributions should restart. The picture, then, is one of a solidly defensive stock with healthy income characteristics. There’s no shame in that, especially these days. But if shareholders are dreaming of excitement, they may have to hope there’s something in the idea that Amazon will one day want to own Morrisons, as opposed to merely distributing its groceries.",2020/9/11 5:22,Collaboration|Accountability|Customer Orientation,Team Collaboration & Communication|Transparency & Disclosure|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Brand Perception & Reputation,"{""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""Jacques admitted he hadn’t read the report that warned of the shelters’ significance until it was too late"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""the blowing up of two 46,000-year-old Indigenous Australians rock shelters"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""Thompson should also ask himself if he’s the right chairman."", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""Rio stands somewhere between laughing stock in Australia""}",The Guardian
None,"Rio Tinto misled Juukan Gorge inquiry and 'can't plead ignorance' as a defence, committee chair says",Business,76,None,"The chair of a parliamentary committee examining Rio Tinto’s destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara says the company appears to have misled the inquiry. “It is hard to argue that we have not been misled by Rio Tinto’s evidence to the inquiry when you look at what was said together with the documents the company has provided on notice,” Queensland LNP MP Warren Entsch told Guardian Australia. “It is a profound statement to say that senior executives did not know when the company has been aware since the early 2000s of the significance of the caves.” Entsch’s attack came as the parliamentary inquiry was forced to indefinitely delay a planned site visit to Juukan Gorge – a decision the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people, said would “rob us of a voice in the proceedings”. Related: Rio Tinto CEO's fate in balance as board to meet after blasting of Aboriginal site The chair’s comments add to pressure from investors and activists for the board of Rio Tinto, which is believed to be meeting this week, to sack chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques over the Juukan Gorge debacle. “If you look at Jacques’ responses to the inquiry it’s hard to come to any other conclusion [than it has been misled],” Entsch said. He also warned other mining companies that they were on notice about the importance of protecting Indigenous heritage sites. “Using the example of Rio Tinto, they would be very, very cautious, or be very, very foolish to barge ahead on mining now, they can’t plead ignorance as a defence,” he said. “There is a lot of international attention on this, and companies would exercise caution under those circumstances.” The two rock shelters were blown up by Rio Tinto on 24 May as part of the expansion of the Brockman 4 iron ore mine in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. An archeological survey, paid for by Rio, found that one of the shelters had been continually occupied over 46,000 years and was of the “highest archeological significance in Australia”. The full significance of the site emerged after Rio Tinto received permission from the WA government in 2013 to destroy the sites. An internal review found that despite receiving the preliminary archeological report in 2014, the full archaeological report in 2018, and two further ethnographic reports detailing the significance of the site to the PKKP peoples, no one at Rio flagged it as a potential risk. Jacques told the parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the sites that he was informed, three days before the blast, of a “potential issue” at the Brockman 4 iron ore mine in the Hammersley ranges. But he said he did not learn the significance of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters until the night of Sunday 24 May – after they have been destroyed. Entsch said Rio Tinto’s reports on Juukan Gorge weren’t done with “petty cash”. “Archaeological surveys are very, very substantial matters,” he said. “Rio then funded a doco on the significance of the caves, featuring the PKKP. I don’t know, I haven’t made a doco, but it costs a bit more than tea money. Somebody must have written the cheque, it wouldn’t have been out of the tea money.” “I chair a committee here that has representatives across the political spectrum, and the committee is as one, we are as one on dealing with this and getting to the bottom of it.” Related: Rio Tinto condemned by shareholders for seeking legal advice before blowing up Juukan Gorge Meanwhile, the chair of the PKKP Aboriginal corporation, John Ashburton, said that the decision to delay on-country hearings because of coronavirus travel restrictions would prolong the investigation which “only serves to further deepen our hurt and anguish”. “This decision serves to rob us of a voice in the proceedings,” chair John Ashburton said. “To date, Rio Tinto and others have been given a voice and public stage to present their views on the disaster. The same courtesy has been denied to us by this delay.” The deadline for the inquiry to make its final report has been pushed back from 30 September to 9 December. “The community deserves the full facts of the Juukan Gorge disaster be told in a timely manner to ensure this kind of tragedy never happens again,” Ashburton said. The National Native Title Council (NNTC) earlier joined calls for an overhaul of the Rio Tinto board to include more Australian directors. In a letter to chairman Simon Thompson, NNTC chief executive Jamie Lowe said Rio Tinto’s appearance before the Senate inquiry and its roundly criticised internal review showed the company had misled the public by blaming failures in “linked-up decision making” for the destruction of an ancient place. Lowe said Rio made “active decisions” to support the blast going ahead, like hiring lawyers against a potential injunction. “It is now clear that what led to the catastrophic destruction of Juukan Gorge was not a result of a breakdown of procedures but a result of the enormous cultural and values deficit within Rio Tinto,” he said. Throughout his evidence to the parliamentary inquiry, and in the 84-page response to questions on notice provided last week , Jacques appeared to put the blame for his ignorance of the potential ramifications of destroying such a heritage-listed site against the wishes of traditional owners back on Perth-based chief executive of iron ore, Chris Salisbury. He said that when he spoke to Salisbury prior to the blast “there was no mention of the cultural heritage issue, the issue was a question of timing and a request by the PKKP”. The minutes of two meetings held in the days before the blast show Salisbury was concerned not about damaging Juukan Gorge but about the potential legal risk of damaging other Aboriginal heritage sites , which the company did not have permission from the Western Australian government to disturb. Related: Juukan Gorge traditional owners 'appalled' by attempted sale of unauthorised photos Rio’s initial public response said it had “all necessary approvals” to destroy the site and was “sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years”. It moved to offer a genuine apology a few weeks later after a backlash from investors. Ratings agency S&P said the Juukan Gorge saga, together with controversy over plans by BHP and Fortescue Metals Group to blast heritage sites, “highlights the fact that social risk factors go beyond legal obligations”. “Any company looking to develop a new project or expand an existing one will need to ensure all stakeholders are satisfied – above and beyond what government legislation stipulates you can or cannot do,” the S&P global ratings director, Minh Hoang, said. “A major investor sitting in London is less interested in the efficacy or otherwise of local government legislation on the other side of the world. But rightly or wrongly, the investor will be concerned about how things ‘look’ to the wider market and community.” S&P thinks this could result in mining projects taking longer to get started. “Mining companies will undoubtedly be circumspect when developing projects. They will look to work with local communities to avoid important heritage sites; they will not want to incur investor wrath.”",2020/9/10 20:08,Integrity|Accountability|Collaboration|Customer Orientation,Transparency & Trust|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Brand Perception & Reputation,"{""Transparency & Trust"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Transparency & Trust"": ""the company appears to have misled the inquiry"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""the company has been aware since the early 2000s of the significance of the caves"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""the PKKP.

None,Hesta super says 'change in ranks' at Rio Tinto won't be enough as Juukan Gorge fallout continues,Australia news,89,None,"Fallout from Rio Tinto’s blasting of a 46,000-year-old sacred site in Western Australia has spread across the Pilbara mining industry, as shareholders call for companies to make public their dealings with traditional owners and demand an immediate halt to any operations that could damage existing sites. One of Australia’s biggest superannuation funds wants a public inquiry into all agreements Rio Tinto has made with Aboriginal traditional owners in the iron ore-rich Pilbara, saying: “A change in the ranks of Rio’s senior leadership won’t mitigate this risk for investors.” Hesta, which manages $52bn on behalf of more than 870,000 Australians, has written to the Rio Tinto board before its meeting, due to go ahead on Thursday in London. Rio’s chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jaques, has been widely tipped to be removed from his post over the matter. Hesta warned that reputational risks from the actions of mining companies could impact their value. “Mining companies that fail to negotiate fairly and in good faith with traditional owners expose the company to reputational and legal risk,” Hesta’s statement said. Related: Banjima people caught up in BHP's Pilbara mine expansion say they were forced to 'trade away' heritage “These risks increase the longer these agreements are in place. Without an independent review, we cannot adequately assess these risks and understand how they may impact value. We have lost confidence that the company can do this on their own.” The super fund wants a review of all current agreements Rio has negotiated with traditional owners in light of revelations that they contain gag orders preventing traditional owners from speaking about their concerns for sacred and significant sites. Hesta said it had sought advice from the economist and lawyer Prof Allan Fels as an appropriate expert to consider the matter. Fels told Guardian Australia: “There are potential unconscionable conduct issues, both at the legal and ethical level. They need to be investigated independently.” He said this included the use of confidentiality clauses. “Someone needs to look behind the confidentiality elements,” he said. An investigation by Guardian Australia found that more than 100 ancient Aboriginal sites in Western Australia could still be destroyed by mining companies, which have obtained legal permission to do so. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) wants Fortescue Metals Group to halt mining activities that would disturb, destroy or desecrate cultural heritage sites in Australia until relevant laws are strengthened, and to lift any confidentiality provisions on Aboriginal traditional owners so they can speak freely and publicly about cultural heritage or other concerns on their land. “As investors, we believe it’s necessary that this shareholder resolution receives strong support – or is proactively adopted by FMG’s board – because there is far too much at stake to allow any further destruction of Indigenous cultural sites, as [the federal MP Warren] Entsch has also made clear,” said the ACCR’s Brynn O’Brien. “In engagement with us, FMG has been clear that it is happy for business to continue as usual. Shareholders, in the wake of Juukan Gorge, know that business as usual is absolutely unacceptable. Related: ‘Test for the board’: UK pension fund heaps pressure on Rio Tinto boss over Juukan Gorge blasts “FMG has a dubious history of engagement with Pilbara native title holders, specifically the Yindjibarndi people. Comments as recently as last year, coming from the chairman saying ‘that is not a community I’m going to empower with tens of millions of your cash’ demonstrate that the company and board have a long way to go in understanding and valuing the intricacies of cultural heritage and the agency of traditional owners.” The ACCR has also sought similar assurances from BHP. FMG said it does not have heritage “gag order” clauses in its agreements with traditional owners and does not support a moratorium on mining activity. “The moratorium, proposed by people unfamiliar with the West Australian mining industry, is not supported by Fortescue as it would disempower local Aboriginal people in the Pilbara and limit the positive contribution the mining industry is making to the state and national economies, at a time when it is needed most,” chief executive Elizabeth Gaines said. Hesta said only a broader review of current practices and agreements with traditional owners “will provide certainty to investors that these risks are properly managed by Australia’s mining industry with fair outcomes for all”. “The larger, systemic issue of how the company and the mining sector negotiates agreements with Traditional Owners needs to be urgently addressed,” it said. Hesta joins several major institutional investors who have criticised Rio Tinto about its conduct surrounding the destruction of Juukan gorge. In May the company blew up a 46,000-year-old significant site against the wishes of traditional owners to access higher grade iron ore. The act triggered international condemnation and prompted a federal parliamentary inquiry. The inquiry, which has had to postpone a planned visit to Western Australia because of difficulties associated with interstate travel and the state government’s recent changes to quarantine restrictions, is continuing. The inquiry chair, Warren Entsch , said there would be a series of remote access public hearings but members still wanted to visit WA as soon as possible. “It is vital to see the destruction first hand and share the experience and the consequences of this policy failure with the traditional owners,” Entsch said. “It is vital that we hear directly from those most affected, the traditional owners of this country, and that can only be done in a meaningful way on country.” Entsch repeated his call for a moratorium on all mining activity which could cause irreversible damage to heritage sites. “No government and no company wants another Juukan Gorge on its conscience,” the LNP MP said. “If nothing else, the ongoing damage to Rio Tinto’s reputation should give pause for thought for all concerned.”",2020/9/10 11:46,Accountability|Ethical Responsibility|Integrity,Transparency & Disclosure|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Ethics & Compliance|Confidentiality & Intellectual Property|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Risk & Regulatory Management,"{""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Confidentiality & Intellectual Property"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""shareholders call for companies to make public their dealings with traditional owners"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""fail to negotiate fairly and in good faith with traditional owners"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""the company and board have a long way to go in understanding and valuing the intricacies of cultural heritage"", ""Confidentiality & Intellectual Property"": ""gag orders preventing traditional owners from speaking about their concerns"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""Rio Tinto’s blasting of a 46,000-year-old sacred site"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""destroy or desecrate cultural heritage sites""}",The Guardian
None,‘Test for the board’: UK pension fund heaps pressure on Rio Tinto boss over Juukan Gorge blasts,Business,72,None,"The Church of England’s pension board, which manages more than ?2.8bn ($AU5bn) in retirement savings, has poured pressure on the board of Rio Tinto to take action against its chief executive over the global miner’s decision to blow up culturally significant 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Australia . Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, the pension board’s director of ethics and engagement, Adam Matthews, stopped short of calling for CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques to be sacked but said investors felt a decision by the Rio board to cut the bonuses of executives in response to the scandal was not sufficient. “We’ve been part of dialogues with the chairman over the past months, and with other investors both in Australia and in the UK, and we’ve expressed the deep concern that we have around this and so it’s very much a test for the board of how serious their response is,” Matthews said when asked if Jacques should go. Related: Banjima people caught up in BHP's Pilbara mine expansion say they were forced to 'trade away' heritage The Rio Tinto board is due to meet this week amid heavy criticism of its behaviour by investors, Australian Indigenous groups and political figures. A well-placed market source said some among Rio Tinto’s major investors now believed the company’s crisis could only be ended by Jaques’ departure and the only question remaining was how quickly it could get him out the door. Matthews said there was “disquiet” among Rio Tinto board members over the company’s decision in May to blow up the ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, in Western Australia that were significant to the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people and showed signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. “They’ll be discussing it this week, but remember the company is under the spotlight on this,” he said. The church pension fund’s call comes on top of those by Australia’s largest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, and the UK-based Local Authority Pension fund (LAPFF) which have heaped pressure on Rio Tinto’s board to sack Jacques. Rio Tinto has also been disparaged by two former Australian prime ministers. On Wednesday, the former Labor PM, Kevin Rudd, said Rio Tinto “will soon be known in Australia as Rio TNT”. “Rio Tintohas blown up its own reputation as anything approximating a responsible corporate citizen in Australia,” Rudd told the ABC. “The executives responsible for this decision should no longer be executives. For the company, I think their reputation now is mud.” Former Coalition prime minister Malcolm Turnbull told the ABC on Monday he had “no idea what went wrong in Rio Tinto, what went wrong with the WA government … to allow it to happen, it just staggers me”. Rio Tinto told an Australian parliamentary inquiry it decided to blow up the caves because doing so would allow it to access better quality iron ore than leaving the site undisturbed. As part of the parliamentary process, the company on Friday released a trove of documents showing that it hired lawyers in preparation to fight off possible attempts by the traditional owners to go to court and stop the blast – a move that was also condemned by investors . Related: Rio Tinto response to Juukan Gorge caves blast not good enough, AustralianSuper says In August, following an internal review conducted by board member Michael L’Estrange , the company’s board stripped $5m from Jacques’ bonus and about $1m from the bonus of its head of iron ore, Chris Salisbury. However, the documents released by the company on Friday have raised questions among investors about the accuracy of the internal review’s findings. “This is still very much ongoing and so it’s concerning that there seems to be sort of different disclosure information at odds with the full report,” Matthews said. Jacques is meeting with traditional owners on whose lands Rio Tinto holds mining leases in Western Australia. He met with representatives from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinkura people on Tuesday and was scheduled to hold on-country meetings with other traditional owners later in the week. The future of the federal parliamentary inquiry is itself in doubt. The inquiry, chaired by government MP Warren Entsch, was preparing to travel to the Pilbara this week to meet traditional owners and view the destruction first, but those plans were abruptly called off on Monday. The WA state government has, according to Entsch, “changed the rules” of travel, “preventing” them from visiting. “I’m profoundly disappointed about this, as is the committee. We were really starting to gather some very interesting information,” Entsch told the ABC. “It’s impossible for us, in my view, to be able to do justice to this inquiry and have full transparency when we’re making decisions unless we’re going to be able to sit down face-to-face with those affected by it.” WA amended requirements for federal parliamentarians entering the state “to minimise the risk of Covid-19”, but WA Premier, Mark McGowan said the travel request had not been rejected. “The chair was advised if the committee still wished to pursue its travel, then application should be made to WA Police, who manage the exemption process,” a spokesman said. Related: More than 100 Aboriginal sacred sites – some dating before the ice age – could be destroyed by mining companies The spokesman said the restrictions are to “protect Aboriginal people living in those communities [in the Pilbara] who are more at risk of serious illness from the coronavirus than other Western Australians.” But Entsch said conducting hearings long distance was not an option because of language and cultural barriers. The WA government would not be drawn on Entsch’s request for a moratorium on s18 applications while the Inquiry is on hold. Under section 18 of the WA Aboriginal heritage act, traditional owners are unable to lodge objections or to prevent their sacred sites from being damaged. “The minister [Wyatt] expects any proponents to have properly consulted with relevant traditional owners,” the spokesman said. The WA Government has released a new draft legislation for public comment, in which s18 has been abolished, but it is unlikely to be introduced to parliament before the next state election in March. Director of the Cape York Institute, Noel Pearson who dealt with Rio Tinto in Queensland after the introduction of native title in the 1990s, said both the internal review and Rio Tinto’s lengthy response to parliamentary questions on notice were “inadequate” and “evasive”. “What Rio Tinto seems to not have accepted is that the starting place for the future has got to be the telling of the truth,” Pearson said.",2020/9/9 19:49,Accountability|Customer Orientation|Respect,Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Brand Perception & Reputation|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Risk & Regulatory Management|Transparency & Disclosure|Cultural & Language Respect,"{""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Cultural & Language Respect"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""the company’s decision in May to blow up the ancient rock shelters"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""Rio Tinto has also been disparaged by two former Australian prime ministers"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""investors felt a decision by the Rio board to cut the bonuses of executives in response to the scandal was not sufficient"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""the company on Friday released a trove of documents showing that it hired lawyers in preparation to fight off possible attempts by the traditional owners to go to court and stop the blast"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""the documents released by the company on Friday have raised questions among investors about the accuracy of the internal review’s findings"", ""Cultural & Language Respect"": ""blow up the caves because doing so would allow it to access better quality iron ore than leaving the site undisturbed""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto CEO's fate in balance as board to meet after blasting of Aboriginal site,Business,71,None,"The fate of Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sébastien Jacques is in the balance as shareholder pressure mounts for executive scalps after the global mining company destroyed a 46,000-year-old significant Aboriginal site at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia. Rio Tinto’s admission in a Friday night information dump that it hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction to stop it blowing up two caves at Juukan Gorge has added to investor pressure that has ramped up ahead of a meeting of the company’s board set for Thursday, Australian time. Guardian Australia understands Jacques met with representatives from the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation this week. The PKKP would not comment on the meeting, saying in a statement that it was working to recover its relationship with the mining giant. Related: Rio Tinto condemned by shareholders for seeking legal advice before blowing up Juukan Gorge “This includes private meetings and discussions with senior executives to share our feelings and attempt to establish a way forward to repair, rebuild and grow our relationship,” they said. “In the interests of maintaining integrity in this process, and in line with our approach to date, the PKKPAC would prefer to not offer further comment publicly at this time.” The company’s board cut millions from the bonuses of Jaques and iron ore head Chris Salisbury last month but investors have demanded more. Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s largest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said the “penalties fall significantly short of appropriate accountability for those responsible” and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors chief executive, Louise Davidson, said executive accountability needed to go “further than just a financial penalty” . On Tuesday, the UK-based Local Authority Pension fund (LAPFF), worth ?300bn ($540bn), piled more pressure on the Rio Tinto board, with the chair, Doug McMurdo, expressing concern about the company’s continued insistence that senior managers did not know what was happening at Juukan Gorge. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said Rio Tinto’s behaviour “beggars belief”. “After blasting Juukan Gorge in May, Rio Tinto assured investors and journalists that the company would be seen in a better light once all the facts emerged,” its legal counsel, James Fitzgerald, said. “Precisely the opposite is proving to be true. The minutes show deliberate efforts to lawyer up and defend the destruction that hadn’t yet occurred. There is no record of surprise, shock, regret or remorse by Rio executives.” The mining company destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received at least five separate reports on the significance of the sites, both archeologically and to the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, since 2013. PKKP spokesman Burchell Hayes has previously said the corporation “only found out by default on 15 May when we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July”. The PKKP people said the destruction of the site – which has triggered global condemnation of the company, a review of WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage legislation and a federal parliamentary inquiry – was “soul-destroying”.",2020/9/9 3:30,Customer Orientation|Collaboration|Accountability|Ethical Responsibility,Brand Perception & Reputation|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Risk & Regulatory Management|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""After blasting Juukan Gorge in May, Rio Tinto assured investors and journalists that the company would be seen in a better light once all the facts emerged"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""Rio Tinto’s admission in a Friday night information dump that it hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction to stop it blowing up two caves at Juukan Gorge"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received at least five separate reports on the significance of the sites, both archeolo"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""Rio Tinto’s admission in a Friday night information dump that it hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction to stop it blowing up two caves at Juukan Gorge has added to investor pressure""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto condemned by shareholders for seeking legal advice before blowing up Juukan Gorge,Business,80,None,"Shareholder groups have heavily criticised Rio Tinto after revelations late last week that it hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the destruction of ancient rock shelters in Juukan Gorge, three days before they were destroyed in a mining blast. Late on Friday Rio released dozens of documents, including minutes of meetings, in response to questions raised by a parliamentary inquiry. At a meeting of senior managers on 21 May, the iron ore boss Chris Salisbury asked about the risk of an injunction, and Rio’s legal counsel, Nic Tole, “advised preparations were under way and external law firm Ashursts [a multinational corporate firm] is instructed”. The minutes show Rio Tinto executives were more concerned about potential damage to Aboriginal heritage sites which they did not have permission to damage than the impact on the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge. “N Tole [Rio Tinto’s legal counsel] confirmed that Rio Tinto is legally covered in respect of the Juukan rock shelters under the existing s18 consent,” the minutes say. Related: Rio Tinto chiefs lose millions in bonuses over destruction of Juukan Gorge The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said Rio Tinto’s behaviour “beggars belief”. “After blasting Juukan Gorge in May, Rio Tinto assured investors and journalists that the company would be seen in a better light once all the facts emerged,” its legal counsel, James Fitzgerald, said. “Precisely the opposite is proving to be true. “A yawning gap is growing between Rio Tinto’s portrayal of events on one hand, and the picture emerging from the evidence on the other. “The upshot of Rio Tinto’s submissions and report is that the destruction of Juukan Gorge was all a tragic mistake for which everyone and no one is responsible. Yet the minutes of internal Rio Tinto meetings on 21 and 22 May, several days before the Juukan blast, reveal a different story. “The minutes show deliberate efforts to lawyer up and defend the destruction that hadn’t yet occurred. There is no record of surprise, shock, regret or remorse by Rio executives.” The meeting on 21 May was called after the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners asked Rio Tinto to delay the blasting and named the rock shelter as a significant heritage site. The PKKP intended to put out a press release, the meeting was told. “Our position is that our participation agreement includes a non-disparagement clause,” the minutes say. “A reactive media statement will be prepared if required.” The UK-based Local Authority Pension fund (LAPFF), worth ?300bn (A$542bn), said it would expect Rio Tinto to “take appropriate legal counsel”, but is concerned about the company’s continued insistence that senior managers did not know what was happening at Juukan Gorge. “There seems to be increasing evidence that the senior executives in question could well have known what was going on, and even if they didn’t, LAPFF’s view is that they should have known,” the Chair of the LAPFF, Doug McMurdo, said. “In either case, we have grave concerns about Rio Tinto’s corporate governance and we expect the board to take appropriate and proportionate measures in response.” In the documents provided to the Senate, Rio Tinto also admitted that many of the 7,000 items salvaged from the Juukan Gorge site were being stored in a non-airconditioned onsite shipping container. Related: Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto hired lawyers for potential injunction against blasting of Aboriginal site Last week an anthropologist, Prof Glynn Cochrane, who spent 20 years implementing Rio Tinto’s social performance program, said he was “not sure [the artefacts] are being held somewhere safe”. “It’s like blowing up the tomb of the unknown soldier and forgetting about the occupant,” he said. Rio Tinto said the storage facility was a sea container and was not climate controlled. “However, not all artefacts are stored there,” it said. “Organic material, such as animal bone and charcoal, is being stored in a secure airconditioned storage room at Rio Tinto’s Aboriginal training and liaison building in Dampier.” A new storage facility had been installed onsite which could be used to house artefacts “if this accords with the wishes of the PKKP”. “The traditional owners can access their material at any time by request,” it said. “The reason that a request must be made is because the facility is located on an active mine site. “We can repatriate anything and everything salvaged from PKKP country at any time should a request be made by the PKKP.” Rio Tinto’s global chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, is in Western Australia seeking a meeting with the PKKP.

None,Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto hired lawyers for potential injunction against blasting of Aboriginal site,Business,68,None,"Rio Tinto hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the destruction of ancient rock shelters in Juukan Gorge three days before it was destroyed in a mining blast, according to meeting notes released to a parliamentary inquiry. The minutes of two meetings held on Thursday 21 May and Friday 22 May were released by the mining company on Friday evening as part of a batch of documents and 85 pages of responses to questions on notice provided to a parliamentary inquiry on the destruction of the significant Aboriginal heritage site. The rock shelters, dubbed Juukan 1 and Juukan 2, were blown up on 24 May to expand the Brockman 4 iron ore mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The company had permission under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws to destroy the sites. According to the minutes of a meeting on 21 May, attended by senior managers including iron ore boss Chris Salisbury, the company was more concerned about the possible impact to new potential Aboriginal heritage sites, which they did not have permission to damage, than the impact on the rock shelters. Related: Rio Tinto chiefs lose millions in bonuses over destruction of Juukan Gorge Minutes of the meeting say that Salisbury asked about the risk of an injunction, and Rio’s legal counsel, Nic Tole, “advised preparations were underway and external law firm Ashursts (a multinational corporate firm) is instructed”. Salisbury was told that the rock shelters “were directly below the blast holes and would be completely damaged with no preventative action possible”, and said that the blast could proceed provided that all necessary due diligence was done to prevent damage to the new potential sites. “N Tole confirmed that Rio Tinto is legally covered in respect of the Juukan rock shelters under the existing s.18 consent,” the minutes say. The meeting was called after the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) traditional owners asked Rio Tinto to delay the blasting and named the rock shelter as a significant heritage site. The minutes say the PKKP advised Rio Tinto that it planned to issue a press statement, and that its legal team had spoken to lawyers for the PKKP. “Our position is that our participation agreement includes a non-disparagement clause,” the minutes said. “A reactive media statement will be prepared if required.” The next day, the same group of senior managers held another 30-minute teleconference and agreed to delay the blast until Sunday to allow a suction truck to be brought in to remove the explosives from the drill holes closest to the potential new sites. The minutes also note that the PKKP provided a report explaining why they consider the site important, but the significance of the site was not discussed. Salisbury lost his $1.1m annual bonus over the destruction of the caves , which caused great distress to the PKKP and made global headlines, prompting a drubbing from some of the mining giant’s major shareholders. Global chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques lost almost $5m in bonuses. He told an Australian parliamentary inquiry last month that he was not aware of the significance of the site until after it was destroyed. An internal company review blamed the destruction of the site, which occurred despite the company having received several reports in the past two years highlighting its extreme significance, to “systemic failures in the cultural heritage management system”. Related: Western Australia revamps Indigenous heritage laws after Juukan Gorge destruction Rio Tinto would not release the full details of its partnership agreement with the PKKP. But it said that, had the company chosen a design for its Brockman 4 mine pit, which placed a 65m buffer around the gorge, it would have forgone 8.1mt in high grade iron ore, which would be worth $4.7m in benefits payable to the PKKP Aboriginal corporation. The PKKP was not told that Rio Tinto had considered three options for designing the mine pit that would have preserved the rock shelters , before the option that ensured their destruction. Rio Tinto denied a suggestion that information was deliberately withheld. It said the value to the company of destroying the sites, versus a 65m buffer, was US$135m. But it said that after the destruction of the rock shelters it had paused all operations in the Juukan Gorge area, which meant that neither Rio Tinto nor the PKKP received any financial benefit from the site. It would not say whether it was discussing compensation with the PKKP, only that it was “in ongoing discussions with the PKKP about how to move forward and rebuild a relationship of trust”. The company suggested that had another option been chosen that avoided damaging the site, its full archeological significance would not have been known. Consent to destroy the site would not have been sought and the salvage operation in 2014, which dated the Juukan 2 rock shelter at 46,000 years old and identified a 4,000-year-old plaited band of hair which showed a direct genetic link to PKKP people living today , would not have occurred. The partnership agreement between the PKKP and Rio Tinto is 714 pages long. Rio said the agreement does not release them from complying with any laws, but that “the form of consent provided by the PKKP includes that the PKKP agreed to restrict, or exercise in a certain way or subject to certain conditions, rights that they otherwise would have under various laws”. “For example, PKKP agreed not to object to or challenge Rio Tinto’s operations. This includes not commencing any claim, proceeding or action under any law to object to or challenge ‘agreed acts’ or Rio Tinto’s iron ore business.” Since the blast, Rio Tinto said it had reviewed more than 400 of the 1,780 Aboriginal heritage sites which it currently has approval, under s.18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act WA (1972), to destroy. An investigation by Guardian Australia found that more than 100 sites in the Pilbara are currently at risk of destruction.

None,Calls for high-level 'personnel changes' at Rio Tinto after Juukan Gorge destruction,Business,82,None,"Calls are growing for mining giant Rio Tinto to take further action over its destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site at Juukan Gorge , with witnesses telling a federal inquiry into the disaster there should be high-level “personnel changes” and compensation paid to traditional owners. Rio Tinto on Monday said it would strip about $5m in bonuses from its chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, and about $1m in bonuses from the iron ore boss, Chris Salisbury, after the company “failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage”. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors chief executive, Louise Davidson, told Friday’s parliamentary inquiry ACSI had met with Rio management to convey “that the reduction of bonuses does not meet our standard, and we are looking for signs from the company that they understand that”. “We expect the [Rio] board to put in place processes to fix what’s gone wrong, but also to acknowledge the failings that have occurred and deliver proper accountability around that,” Davidson said. “We won’t say person A or person B, but what we want is for the board to be really clear about how they are going to take responsibility and accountability for what’s occurred. We think the board should demonstrate how it is taking accountability further than just a financial penalty.” Related: More than 100 Aboriginal sacred sites – some dating before the ice age – could be destroyed by mining companies Earlier, the world-leading anthropologist Prof Glynn Cochrane, who spent 20 years implementing Rio Tinto’s social performance program, expressed serious concern about the adequacy of Rio Tinto’s storage of 7,000 items salvaged from the Juukan Gorge site, saying he was “not sure they are being held somewhere safe”. Cochrane said the items were sitting in a shipping container on the site, and it appeared they were salvaged on a tight timeframe and budget. “It’s like blowing up the tomb of the unknown soldier and forgetting about the occupant,” Cochrane said. In his view, there was an intentional weakening of the authority of senior experts and archaeologists in the company between 2016 and when Juukan Gorge was destroyed in May. “They have done away with the community relations system we created in 1995,” he said. “It’s all about branding, marketing and media. Those are the people they hired and employed in the Pilbara. I can’t see any evidence they are employing people to pay proper respect to cultural heritage.” Cochrane said there was a conflict of interest when governments that received royalties and companies were both involved in decision-making about sacred sites in the path of mining operations. “You hear of situations where there’s a fox in charge of chickens … I know of very few situations where there are two foxes in charge of the chickens,” he said. Prof Marcia Langton told the inquiry compensation was due to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. Langton said the agreement they had with Rio Tinto should be made public “so that a proper assessment can be made of whether or not it was breached, not only in relation to Juukan but also this matter of cultural heritage being stored in shipping containers on mine sites”. “This is not heritage protection, this demonstrates complete contempt for cultural heritage protection,” the academic said. “The gag clause that stops traditional owners from speaking about the terms of that agreement publicly combine to deprive Australians of transparency of these arrangements, and delivers to the mining company carte blanche to conduct its operations secretly. “It may well be in breach [of its agreement] but neither the traditional owners nor the Australian public has any way of knowing.” Related: Rio Tinto response to Juukan Gorge caves blast not good enough, AustralianSuper says The National Native Title Council’s Jamie Lowe said the federal government should set up an independent national body to manage Aboriginal cultural heritage, from which traditional owners could seek protection for their important and sacred sites. “The industry cannot be trusted to self-regulate, and it cannot be trusted to negotiate fairly on native title agreements,” Lowe said. He said native title groups needed to be resourced to negotiate deals with industry, where there was currently an “extreme power imbalance”. These prescribed body corporates aren’t funded by government, the NNTC deputy chair, Kado Muir, said, and they are overwhelmed with the demands of having to negotiate so many agreements concurrently with mining and other resource companies. Under native title legislation, traditional owner groups have a six-month window in which to negotiate a land-use agreement. Lowe said he shared concerns about the treatment of items salvaged from important sites. “Our heritage doesn’t belong in a shipping container. It needs to be in a keeping place where our young people can visit it. It’s incredibly disrespectful … and just speaks again to the inadequacies of resourcing of our mob. “We want to put our culture somewhere. If they’re going to remove it from the earth we should at least have a place to respect it.”",2020/8/28 15:47,Accountability|Respect|Collaboration,Corporate Governance & Oversight|Recognition & Appreciation|Transparency & Disclosure|Ethical Compliance & Internal Control|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""positive"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative""}",0.77,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""Calls for high-level 'personnel changes' at Rio Tinto after Juukan Gorge destruction"", ""Recognition & Appreciation"": ""compensation paid to traditional owners"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""the agreement they had with Rio Tinto should be made public"", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""gag clause that stops traditional owners from speaking about the terms""}",The Guardian
None,"Rio Tinto response to Juukan Gorge caves blast not good enough, AustralianSuper says",Business,83,None,"Australia’s biggest super fund, the $180bn AustralianSuper, has dismissed as inadequate Rio Tinto’s decision to strip bonuses from executives over the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara. Ian Silk, the chief executive of AustralianSuper, said a report into the debacle by Rio Tinto’s board “highlights profound systemic, operational and governance failings”. “AustralianSuper has met with the chair of Rio Tinto and expressed our view that the proposed penalties fall significantly short of appropriate accountability for those responsible,” Silk said. “We have asked the board to reconsider its response and are continuing to engage with the company on the matter.” Silk did not say what additional action AustralianSuper wanted. Related: Rio Tinto chiefs lose millions in bonuses over destruction of Juukan Gorge It is believed the fund, which owns about $1.3bn in Rio Tinto shares, is yet to receive a response to its demands from the company. Rio Tinto destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received five separate reports on the significance of the sites since 2013. On Monday, Rio Tinto said it would strip about $5m in bonuses from chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and about $1m in bonuses from iron ore boss Chris Salisbury after the company “failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage”. The internal review has received criticism from industry and shareholder groups. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the review was “highly disappointing” and “little more than a public relations exercise.” “Tens of thousands of years of cultural significance get blown up and all that goes to show for it is $7m of lost remuneration,” ACCR’s James Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that was “pocket change for these highly paid executives” and that Jacques and Niven should lose their jobs. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors said the review “does not deliver any meaningful accountability”. “Remuneration appears to be the only sanction applied to executives,” the council’s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. “This raises the question – does the company feel that ?4m [about $7m] is the right price for the destruction of cultural heritage?” The $52bn super fund Hesta said investors are concerned risks aren’t being appropriately managed after the destruction of the Juukan Gorge. Hesta says it has outlined its investor expectations in a letter to 14 Australian mining and energy companies. “We are committed to engaging with companies to understand how they are managing these issues, and we will consider using our voting rights where we identify the need for improved practices and disclosure,” the Hesta CEO, Debby Blakey, said.

None,"Major investment firm dumps Exxon, Chevron and Rio Tinto stock",Environment,51,None,"A Nordic hedge fund worth more than $90bn (?68.6bn) has dumped its stocks in some of the world’s biggest oil companies and miners responsible for lobbying against climate action. Storebrand, a Norwegian asset manager, divested from miner Rio Tinto as well as US oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron as part of a new climate policy targeting companies that use their political clout to block green policies. The investor is one of many major financial institutions divesting from polluting industries, but is understood to be the first to dump shares in companies which use their influence to slow the pace of climate action. Jan Erik Saugestad, the chief executive of Storebrand, said corporate lobbying activity designed to undermine solutions to “ the greatest risks facing humanity ” is “simply unacceptable”. Storebrand will also divest from German chemicals company BASF and US electricity supplier Southern Company for lobbying against climate regulation, and a string of companies that derive more than 5% of their revenues from coal or oil sands. “We need to accelerate away from oil and gas without deflecting attention on to carbon offsetting and carbon capture and storage. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are readily available alternatives,” he said. “The Exxons and Chevrons of the world are holding us back,” he added. “This initial move does not mean that BP, Shell, Equinor and other oil and gas majors can rest easy and continue with business as usual, even though they are performing relatively better than US oil majors.” ExxonMobil lobbyists met key European commission officials in an attempt to water down the European Green Deal in the weeks before it was agreed, according to climate lobbying watchdog InfluenceMap. Saugestad said he expects Storebrand’s investor peers will follow its lead in divesting from companies that support anti-climate lobbying “as part of a logical progression in global fossil fuel divestment”. InfluenceMap has previously found that five of the largest listed oil companies – including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total – spend about $200m a year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The analysis found that BP spent the most on lobbying activities. The company successfully lobbied US policymakers to weaken a landmark environmental law , clearing the way for new projects, such as oil pipelines and power plants, to move forward with far less federal review of their environmental impact. Under BP’s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, the company has undertaken a major review of its lobby group memberships and severed ties with three associations because of disagreements over their climate-related policies and activities.

None,Rio Tinto chiefs lose millions in bonuses over destruction of Juukan Gorge,Business,73,None,"Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques has lost almost $5m in bonuses and the head of Rio Tinto’s Australian iron ore group will lose more than $1m over the destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site at Juukan Gorge , after an internal review found “systemic failures in the cultural heritage management system”. The mining company destroyed two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 24 May, despite having received five separate reports on the significance of the sites, both archeologically and to the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people, since 2013. An internal report , released on Monday, found that Rio Tinto “failed to meet some of its own internal standards and procedures in relation to the responsible management and protection of cultural heritage”, and also failed its own aspirations in working with Indigenous groups. Related: Juukan Gorge traditional owners 'appalled' by attempted sale of unauthorised photos It said that as a result of the report’s findings, the board had voted to support a decision to withhold the bonuses of three senior executives, and that other managers, not at executive level, might also lose their bonuses. The board’s non-executive directors also agreed to donate 10% of their 2020 director fees to the Clontarf Foundation, a non-Aboriginal organisation that supports Aboriginal education and employment. Penalties labelled ‘pocket change’ for executives Jacques was due to receive an annual bonus of $3.1m (?1.7) and a long-term performance bonus of $1.8m (?1m) in 2021. The chief executive of Rio Tinto Iron ore, Chris Salisbury, was expected to receive a bonus of $1.1m this year, and the global group executive of corporate relations, Simone Niven, was expected to receive $959,702 (?525,000). “In making these decisions, the remuneration committee considered the shortfalls identified in the board review, which revealed systemic failures in the cultural heritage management system operating at Brockman 4 over an extended period of time,” the report said. It said that the three executives had failed through “acts of omission, rather than commission”. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility’s James Fitzgerald said the review was “highly disappointing” and “little more than a public relations exercise that still attempts to blame the PKKP; previous Rio Tinto administrations; and anyone else, rather than the company’s current senior management”. “Tens of thousands of years of cultural significance get blown up and all that goes to show for it is $7m of lost remuneration,” Fitzgerald said. He said that was “pocket change for these highly paid executives” and that Jacques and Niven should lose their jobs. The Australian Council of Superannuation Investors said the review “does not deliver any meaningful accountability” and an “independent and transparent review would have given investors greater confidence that [the] accountability applied was appropriate and proportionate”. “Remuneration appears to be the only sanction applied to executives,” the council’s chief executive, Louise Davidson, said. “This raises the question – does the company feel that ?4 million (about $7m) is the right price for the destruction of cultural heritage?” Company focused on approval not protection The report found that the company was more focused on gaining approval to conduct mining activities than it was on managing and protecting Aboriginal heritage, and that once approval was granted under Western Australia’s decades-old Aboriginal heritage laws to destroy the rock shelters they disappeared from mine planning maps, because a “buffer zone” was no longer required. “Without this information, the risk to social licence was not fully apparent from the perspective of mine operations, creating a ‘blind spot’ for operational management,” the report found. “With changes in personnel over the years, knowledge and awareness of the location and significance of the Juukan rockshelters among operating and senior management were lost.” The report found that the failures in the heritage information management system was a “fatal flaw” and was “symptomatic of a work culture that was more focused on ensuring that necessary approvals and consents were in place for ground disturbance of culturally significant sites, rather than also managing changing cultural heritage issues that could arise on sites where authorisation and consents for ground disturbance had previously been obtained.” But it does not name any individuals who were responsible for changing the plan, and stresses that Jacques himself was not aware of the full significance of the site until after it was destroyed. It says the heritage team was under-resourced and “siloed”, but does not explain why local mining managers – who work out of an administration building decorated with a latex mould of the wall of Juukan 2, and were personally told of the significance the site held to the PKKP – did not raise the issue. Multiple missed opportunities to review plans Rio Tinto received permission under section 18 of the state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act to destroy two rock shelters, dubbed Juukan 1 and Juukan 2, in December 2013. Two years earlier, it signed a partnership agreement with the PKKP over the management of the Brockman 4 iron ore mine on PKKP land. In 2012, when Rio Tinto was finalising the design of its mine pit, its heritage team requested that a buffer zone be placed around Juukan Gorge. The company developed four options for the mine pit, and chose the one which directly impacted on Juukan Gorge . The PKKP were not made aware, until a parliamentary inquiry which began last month , that there was ever an option for the mine which did not involve destroying the site. Related: Rio Tinto did not tell traditional owners blowing up Juukan Gorge site was just one option for mine The report found that Rio Tinto could have better communicated with the PKKP when finalising the pit design and applying for s.18 approval in 2012 and 2013. It said it also could have reviewed its plans when it received an ethnographic report in 2013 that said the Juukan Gorge and Purlykuti creek area, including the rock shelters, were of “of high significance to Puutu Kunti Kurrama, in the old days and still today”; and in August 2014 when it received a preliminary report from archeologist Dr Michael Slack, who conducted a salvage dig, that Juukan 2 was “one of the most archeologically significant sites in Australia”. It said Rio Tinto should also have reviewed its plans in December 2018, when it received a final report from Slack which stated that Juukan 2 had been occupied continually for 46,000 years – almost twice as long as previously estimated – and said it “has the amazing potential to radically change our understanding of the earliest human behaviour in Australia”. The company received another ethnographic report in March of 2020, which reiterated that the site was of “high significance to the PKKP”, and found the rock shelters were a “connected complex rather than a number of isolated cultural heritage sites”. Around the same time, the heritage worker for the PKKP reiterated the significance of the site to the local mine manager, and the PKKP had requested permission to visit “while we still can”. “These changing realities in the period from 2018 should have prompted a review within Rio Tinto of the implications of the new ethnographic and archaeological reports for the Brockman 4 mine development plans, and especially their timing and sequencing,” the report found. “Such a review should have been initiated even in the absence of a formal request by the PKKP . “These steps were not taken and important opportunities for pausing and re-considering options were missed until the PKKP formally raised their concerns in May 2020, by which time, as described in our submission to the Inquiry, it was no longer safe and practicable to protect the sites.” It said those steps were not taken because of “shortfalls in linked-up decision-making within the Rio Tinto organisation, and standards of governance and accountability, which call into question aspects of the work culture and priorities at Brockman 4”. Rio Tinto will establish a new social performance role, which will oversee “key group-level risks” including cultural heritage risks. It will also require that regular audits of cultural heritage be conducted and reported to board level. “There needs to be a clear recognition across the Rio Tinto organisation that, in circumstances in which appropriate authority has been given to disturb a cultural heritage site and related mitigation and salvage operations have been completed, ongoing review of that site’s heritage status continues to be required, and will need to be elevated in decision making as required,” the report said. “This is critical in situations in which material new knowledge about the site is acquired.” The parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the sites is ongoing.

None,Rio Tinto did not tell traditional owners blowing up Juukan Gorge site was just one option for mine,Australia news,77,None,"Rio Tinto did not tell traditional owners that it had the option of not blowing up significant cultural heritage sites in the Juukan Gorge and the company’s senior executives were not aware of the significance of the site until after it was destroyed, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. Two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia were blown up in the expansion of one of Rio Tinto’s open-cut iron ore mines , dubbed Brockman 4, on 24 May. One of the rock shelters showed evidence of 46,000 years of continual occupation and was classified by an archeologist hired by Rio Tinto to survey and salvage the sites to be of the “highest archeological significance” in Australia. Related: Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge rock shelters 'to access higher volumes of high-grade ore' Rio Tinto had approval under s.18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal heritage legislation to blow up the sties , but the destruction sparked global outrage and is the subject of a federal parliamentary inquiry Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, said the company reviewed four possible options for the design of the Brockman 4 mine pit in 2013 and 2012 , three of which would have avoided damage to the site. “The difference between option four and the other three options was 8m tonnes of high grade iron ore,” Jacques said. “The economic value was around $135m of net value at the time of the decision.” That amounts to about 2.5% of the volume of Rio Tinto’s total iron ore production in the Pilbara last financial year. Asked when the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples (PKKP) were made aware of the other options, Jacques said: “The PKKP was not made aware that four options were available in 2012-2013, and at the relevant meeting in 2013 only one option was presented to the PKKP.” Labor MP Anika Wells asked: “They were not made aware that there were three other options that did not involve the destruction of the caves?” “That is absolutely correct,” Jacques said. The inquiry chair, Liberal MP Warren Entsch, said that admission called into question Rio’s claim that it had negotiated an agreement with the PKKP which included their free, prior and informed consent to damage the sites. “Their informed consent,” Entsch stressed. “There is an admission that it was conveyed to the PKKP that there was only one option … that really bothers me.” The PKKP signed a series of agreements with Rio Tinto, dating back to 2006, which included a clause that they would not oppose s.18 applications provided Rio Tinto made “all reasonable endeavours” to minimise impact. The agreement also has confidentiality clauses, and the minister for northern Australia, Matt Canavan, sought an assurance from Rio Tinto that it would not pursue legal action against the PKKP if it were to breach those confidentiality agreements by giving evidence to the inquiry. The PKKP has not yet made a public submission to the inquiry. Jacques told the inquiry on Friday that he was first informed of an “issue” around the planned blast of the Brockman 4 mine on Thursday 21 May. But he said he was not made aware of the “significance” of the site until the evening of 24 May, after it had been blown up, when he saw a draft press release from the PKKP. Brad Haynes, Rio Tinto’s vice president corporate relations Australia , said he read the “summary details” of the 2018 archeological report on the week of 20 May, once the PKKP had raised issues about the significance of the site, but had not read it prior to that week. Haynes said no member of Rio Tinto’s senior executive was aware of the significance of the caves prior to the blast. The site had been surveyed three times at Rio Tinto’s expense, most recently in 2014, when a report by Slack archeology noted it was a site of extremely high cultural significance. A formal report on its significance was provided to the company in 2018, which they passed on to the PKKP. But senior executives did not read that report. Related: Expansion of Pilbara mine threatens 60,000-year-old sacred site, inquiry hears “At no point during this period, up until May of this year, no one in your executive team was aware of the implications of mining this site?” Labor MP Warren Snowdon asked. Haynes said: “Yes, Mr Snowdon, and that’s because we were always operating on the basis that there was consent.” Rio had drilled 382 blast holes and filled them all with 66 tonnes of explosives and detonators by 13 May. The PKKP became aware of the planned blast the next day, and by 20 May had written to the federal minister requesting urgent intervention. Chris Salisbury, the chief executive of iron ore, said that the company’s own blast experts and independent explosives consultants told them that “removing the blast might be difficult and have extensive safety risks”. He said he was made aware of the issue on 21 May, and “was aware there was significance of the site which was conveyed to us via email … but I was not aware of the archeological report at that point”. The company did spend 10 hours trying to remove the explosives from eight drill holes, and succeeded with seven – but that effort was made because the PKKP flagged a possible risk to heritage sites that were not subject to s.18 approval. Rio Tinto has now apologised at senior levels for the blast , and Jacques led with another apology on Friday. LNP MP George Christiansen asked whether this was genuine sorrow, or sorrow over the incident making the news. “Because this was known,” he said. “Do you accept that, that this was a known thing that at any stage Rio could have made another decision on?” Jacques said that “the destruction of the rock shelter should not have happened and we are absolutely sorry for everything”. He said the company’s actions were “simply not sufficient”. He said that, to date, no financial penalties have been issued against any individual staff member, and no individual staff member has been reprimanded or counselled. But he disputed a claim made by his predecessor, Sam Walsh, who told the Australian Financial Review that he issued instructions that the Juukan Gorge not be damaged. Walsh was chief executive when Rio Tinto applied for and received permission to destroy the site. “We couldn’t find any communication referred to by Mr Walsh from the press this morning,” Jacques said.",2020/8/7 14:15,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Collaboration|Integrity,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Transparency & Disclosure|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Ethics & Compliance|Remediation & Restoration Efforts,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""positive"", ""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""positive""}",0.83,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""blowing up Juukan Gorge site"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""destruction of the caves"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""not tell traditional owners"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""not made aware that four options were available"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""no financial penalties have been issued"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""had approval under s.18 of the Western Australian Aboriginal heritage legislation"", ""Remediation & Restoration Efforts"": ""apologised at senior levels for the blast""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto blew up Juukan Gorge rock shelters 'to access higher volumes of high-grade ore',Australia news,92,None,"Rio Tinto could have chosen one of three options to expand its iron ore mine that would not have damaged a 46,000-year-old highly significant Aboriginal heritage site in Juukan Gorge , but chose a fourth option that did damage the rock shelters “in order to access higher volumes of high-grade ore”. In a submission to a Senate inquiry on the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, Rio Tinto acknowledged that “various opportunities were missed to re-evaluate the mine plan in light of this material new information” on the significance of one of the sites. It repeated earlier public comments that the destruction of the rock shelters, dubbed Juukan 1 and Juukan 2, “should not have occurred”. “Rio Tinto has unreservedly apologised to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP), and we reaffirm that apology now,” the submission states. “For the benefit of current and future generations of Australians, we are determined to learn the lessons to ensure that the destruction of heritage sites of exceptional archaeological and cultural significance, such as the Juukan rock shelters, never occurs again.” Related: Former Rio Tinto employees condemn destruction of 46,000-year-old sacred site at Juukan Gorge Rio said it “failed to meet our own internal standards in relation to the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters in May 2020”. Former senior employees of Rio Tinto also made submissions to the Senate inquiry saying the same thing. The Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday. The rock shelters, in the Hamersley Range in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, were damaged in a mining blast on 23 May as part of the expansion of Rio Tinto’s Brockman 4 iron ore mine, despite the PKKP repeatedly saying they wanted to preserve the site and issuing an urgent request to stop the blasts five days before the detonation. In their 46-page submission, Rio Tinto said the company had drilled 382 blast holes and loaded them with explosives by 13 May, the day before the PKKP learned of the upcoming destruction. They said they engaged an independent expert to see if the blast holes could be safely unloaded, but that a management committee, including the iron ore chief executive, Chris Salisbury , “did not consider it feasible to remove the shot from the holes to protect Juukan 1 and Juukan 2”. “There was insufficient time to do so safely given the limitations on the stability of the explosives and the unacceptable environmental and safety risks,” the submission said. Salisbury toured the site with representatives from the PKKP in early June and found they were “impacted but not entirely destroyed”. The submission said Rio Tinto was made aware in 2014, and again in 2018, that one of the rock shelters, Juukan 2, was of “the highest archeological significance in Australia”, as reported by archeologist Dr Michael Slack, who conducted excavation and salvage works on the two rock shelters in 2014. Related: Rio Tinto caves on demands to release review of Indigenous heritage site destruction In his 2018 report, which Rio Tinto received in December of that year and forwarded to the PKKP in January, Slack wrote that “the Juukan 2 rock shelter has the amazing potential to radically change our understanding of the earliest human behaviour in Australia”. “To date, there is no other site of this age with faunal remains in unequivocal association with stone tools. The significance of this cannot be overstated.” Rio obtained ministerial consent to destroy or damage the sites from the Western Australian government under that state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act in 2013, following consultation with the PKKP and their then representatives, the Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation, and said it did not reconsider that agreement in light of the new information from the 2014 digs. It also said the PKKP had signed a financial agreement with Rio Tinto in 2011, and again in 2013, not to oppose any applications to destroy or damage heritage under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, “provided Rio Tinto used its reasonable endeavours to minimise impacts of those operations on Aboriginal heritage sites and consulted with the PKKP about the means of doing so”. It said that of the four options considered for the open-cut iron ore pit in 2013, before ministerial consent was sought, “three avoided the shelters to varying distances. The fourth option impacted the rock shelters in order to access higher volumes of high-grade ore, and was the option that was chosen by Rio Tinto.” The Western Australian government submission to the Senate inquiry admitted its current laws were in dire need of an overhaul. It said the Aboriginal Heritage Act has “been a source of conflict involving Aboriginal people and land use proponents” because it “does not encourage protection of Aboriginal heritage through co-existence with compatible land uses or modification of proposals to avoid or minimise impacts”, lacks dispute resolution processes, and any “penalties for infringement are very low in comparison to other Australian states and territories.” It said new legislation has been under discussion for several years and would be introduced in 2020. However, it also said the federal Aboriginal heritage act, while “outdated”, gives the environment minister, in this case Sussan Ley, the “power to make a declaration to protect an area, object or class of objects from a threat of injury or desecration”. It is a power used sparingly. The federal environment department’s submission, also lodged on Tuesday, said that of 541 applications received since 1984, seven have resulted in long-term declarations of protection. Environment ministers have made at least 21 declarations for short-term or emergency protection, but in a majority of the cases “there was insufficient evidence for the minister to conclude that the areas specified in the applications were significant Aboriginal areas” as defined in the act. The federal government’s submission does not directly address questions about whether the minster was approached to use the power to prevent the explosion at Juukan Gorge but states “the minister cannot make a declaration unless an Indigenous person (or a person representing an Indigenous person) has made an application for it”.

None,"Former Rio Tinto employees condemn destruction of 46,000-year-old sacred site at Juukan Gorge",Business,83,None,"The Senate inquiry into Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old sacred site at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara has heard from former senior employees, who said the company was in “serious breach of its own standards” and that the destruction “sadly was waiting to happen”. Other expert submissions to the inquiry, which is due to report in September, have also raised questions about why the federal government did not stop the destruction, when it had the legal power to do so. In May, Rio Tinto faced international condemnation when it destroyed the sacred site to expand its iron ore mine. The cave in Juukan Gorge was the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last ice age and a genetic link to its traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. The company initially said the blast followed a “misunderstanding” with the PKKP but then issued a public apology. Rio Tinto’s actions have since been compared by shareholder groups to widespread poor conduct in the financial services sector before the banking royal commission. The company was also stripped of its partner status with Reconciliation Australia. Related: 'Heritage of all Australians': Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control after call for mining halt Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under Western Australia’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents. The WA Aboriginal Heritage Act does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal. The WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, a Yamatji man, said he had not known about Juukan Gorge until after the blast happened. But his department was aware. The Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage held a pre-arranged meeting with advisers for the PKKP four days before the blast. It told the PKKP advisers there was no way to revoke the section 18 approval, and called Rio Tinto after the meeting. Federal Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt, also a Yamatji man and cousin to his West Australian counterpart, admitted lawyers from the PKKP contacted his office on 20 May, seeking an injunction under federal laws. Wyatt referred them to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the federal Aboriginal heritage protection actHis office did not follow-up with Ley until after the sites were destroyed. Former senior Commonwealth public servant Dr Bill Gray helped draw up and administer the act when it began in 1984. Gray said the act could have been used to stop the blast, and questions must be asked about why it failed. “It is legislation of last resort which enables the minister to exercise his or her discretion to intervene,” Gray said. “It can be used to override state legislation or other agreements, provide emergency declarations to protect significant Aboriginal sites that are in imminent danger of being destroyed.” Related: We need a thorough investigation into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves. A mere apology will not cut it | Marcia Langton Gray said the Senate should clarify the “sequence of events and decision making process” undertaken by federal ministers to protect the Juukan site from being destroyed. “Unless these questions are answered, it will remain unclear as to how, in 2020 Australia, a site of such traditional and world significance could be the subject of such a catastrophic act of destruction by one of the largest mining companies in the world which, until now, had promoted itself as having exemplary and respectful relationships with the local traditional owners in the Pilbara,” he said. “Commonwealth legislation exists which could have protected the Juukan Gorge site. Why did it fail on this occasion?” World-leading archaeologist Prof Glynn Cochrane, who spent 20 years implementing Rio Tinto’s social performance program, said the company had offered “no convincing explanation” for the destruction of the caves. “It was not done for gain,” Cochrane said. “[Former Rio boss] Leon Davis said it was not worth the few tons of iron ore the company might achieve.” Rio Tinto’s management of cultural resources in the Pilbara had been “stripped down” in recent years, Cochrane said. The focus is on securing “quick clearance – the removal of impediments to mining – something that too frequently results in the destruction of sacred sites”. “While legal changes may discourage bad behaviour they cannot necessarily promote the good behaviour and enlightened stewardship that is now missing,” he said. Another long-term senior Rio Tinto employee, Bruce Harvey, said a loss of expertise in cultural heritage management at the company was a factor. “These included world-class archaeologists and anthropologists who had the necessary seniority in Rio Tinto and sufficient forthrightness to have spoken up on the folly of the proposed destruction,” Harvey said. Harvey worked for Rio Tinto for seven years as a senior adviser on social performance, after 27 years as a geologist and chief adviser to Rio Tinto and its predecessors on Aboriginal community relations. “While Rio Tinto was not in breach of the law, I contend it was in serious breach of its own standards and world leading guidance on the matter of cultural heritage management,” Harvey said. “Juukan, or an event like it, sadly was waiting to happen and perhaps overdue.” Australian National University emeritus professor Jon Altman, who has researched land rights and native title matters for more than 40 years, said Indigenous people had a right to expect stronger protection of their cultural heritage. “There is currently a culture of tokenism and symbolism” that marginalises Indigenous knowledge and views, while mining companies hold influence over legislation, he said. “I am not suggesting that multinational corporations like Rio Tinto and BHP and others have operated outside the letter of the law,” Altman wrote. “What I am saying is that they have been far too influential in shaping the law to suit their instrumental extractive profit-seeking interests.” Related: Rio Tinto chief says he 'fully respects' Indigenous academic after her rebuke of Juukan Gorge debacle He said “at all jurisdictional levels in Australia there is a degree of state capture by industry” while the native title act is “frozen in the past”. The limited rights offered to traditional owners leave them with little bargaining power Altman said, and “being forced to sign off on risky agreements that result in debacles like the destruction at Juukan Gorge”. Rio Tinto has said it will provide a submission to the senate inquiry, and its global chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, will appear at its hearings.

None,Rio Tinto chief says he 'fully respects' Indigenous academic after her rebuke of Juukan Gorge debacle,Business,88,None,"Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques has said he “fully respects” the views of Indigenous academic Prof Marcia Langton after she slammed the mining company for handing over the management of native title agreements to “spin doctors”. Jacques, who was speaking in London as Rio announced a half-year profit of $3.45bn, refused to address specific criticisms made by Langton but repeated his earlier apologies for the company’s decision to blow up 46,000-year-old caves at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia earlier this year. He said the company would make a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into the debacle on Friday, and he would also be giving evidence to the committee. The company’s board is conducting a separate review which Jacques said would be made public . Langton – who has previously had a good working relationship with Rio Tinto – slammed the company on Tuesday over the way it deals with traditional owners in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia . Related: The destruction of a 46,000-year-old cave and the backlash for Australia’s mining industry “The destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves demonstrates that in the implementation of Indigenous land use agreements, Rio Tinto has little regard for the formal provisions of agreement and little regard for the spirit of the agreement that establishes a ‘partnership’ with the traditional owners,” Langton said. She said that after Rio ran into financial strife in the 2010s “community relations personnel in Australia were made redundant and the complex native title agreements were handed over to spin doctors to manage”. Asked about this allegation, Jacques said: “I fully respect her views.” “We are taking the relationship with the traditional owners very seriously, there is no doubt from this perspective,” he said. “It is fair to say that if I reflect on the past 10 years, the reporting line of the heritage team has been changing a few times. “At some stage, it was under finance, at some stage it was under HR, and so on and so forth.” He said the company now had a position on the executive committee of the iron ore division dedicated to heritage issues “to make sure we have the right position around the table”. He said he met with Langton to discuss her concerns. “I’m not going to comment on the comment made by Marcia, but once again the only thing I can say here is that one topic that the board-led review will look into is to make sure that we fully understand the root cause of what happened,” he said. Jacques said the company wanted to make sure it did not make the same mistake again. The company is also dealing with an Australian tax bill of more than $530m over a marketing hub it set up in Singapore and a long-running investigation into a multimillion-dollar payment to a consultant in relation to a stake in a vast iron ore deposit in Guinea’s Simandou mountains. Rio said Australian and Singaporean tax authorities had agreed to negotiate with each other about how much tax should be paid in each country. “If the tax authorities are unable to reach agreement within two years, any disagreement between them will be resolved via binding arbitration,” the company told the stock exchange. “We will accept the outcome of this bilateral dispute resolution process.” Related: Rio Tinto caves on demands to release review of Indigenous heritage site destruction Rio controls two of the four blocks at Simandou in a joint venture with its largest shareholder, Chinalco. The other two blocks are controlled by a multinational consortium that also includes interests from China. Rio’s involvement in Simandou has been under investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office since 2017 over the payment in 2011 of US$10.5m to a French consultant. The company is in negotiations with the SFO towards striking a deferred prosecution agreement, under which it would pay a fine and avoid going to trial, the Financial Times reported . Jacques said the Simandou project “will happen with or without Rio Tinto involvement” due to growing demand from China for high-quality iron ore. Rio was weighing its options given the company already produces high-quality ore from its mines in the Pilbara, he said. Jacques said the coronavirus crisis meant the world was in “unprecedented times”. However, he said China was enjoying a “very steep V-shaped recovery” and Rio’s iron ore order books were full.",2020/7/29 19:29,Respect|Accountability|Integrity,Workplace Respect & Fairness|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Transparency & Disclosure|Ethics & Compliance,"{""Workplace Respect & Fairness"": ""positive"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Workplace Respect & Fairness"": ""fully respects"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""refused to address specific criticisms"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""board is conducting a separate review which Jacques said would be made public"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""Rio’s iron ore order books were full""}",The Guardian

None,"Rio Tinto smelter in New Zealand to close with loss of 1,000 jobs",World news,87,None,"More than 1,000 jobs will be lost in New Zealand after mining giant Rio Tinto said it would close an aluminium smelter at the bottom of the South Island. New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS), at Tiwai Point will close in August 2021 after a strategic review found the business was not viable. The smelter uses alumina from refineries in Queensland and Western Australia, and exports 90% of its product. It is also New Zealand’s biggest consumer of electricity, using roughly 13% of the country’s power, and one of the country’s biggest single-site employers. The smelter was given an exemption to continue operating through the Covid-19 lockdown, but the deteriorating outlook for aluminium use sealed its fate. A $NZ46m ($A43m) loss last year prompted a review of its operations, the company said, though the New Zealand government insisted the smelter’s fail bid to secure more subsidies was the real reason behind the closure. Rio Tinto Aluminium’s chief executive, Alf Barrios, said: “It is very unfortunate we could not find a solution with our partners to secure a power price reduction aimed at making NZAS a financially viable business,” he said in a statement on Thursday. Southland mayor Tim Shadbolt said he was “utterly shattered” by the closure. Many Southland families have worked at the smelter for generations. “Everything is sort of up in the air,” Tim Talamahina told the Southland Times . He has worked at the smelter for 20 years, like his father, and said Rio Tinto had provided generous, steady employment. “I guess you are going to have 1,000 people looking for jobs now in such a small place. Who knows what is going to happen.’’ Southland locals told the paper the economic impact would be huge, and many would lose their homes. The shutdown was “devastating” for such a small community, and would take years to recover from. Related: New Zealand threatens to sue Rio Tinto after floods threatened toxic waste Finance minister Grant Robertson said given the challenging economic situation caused by Covid-19 it was “disappointing” that Rio Tinto had decided to close the smelter, “ especially given the support New Zealand has shown the company and how profitable they are globally”. “There is a degree of inevitability to the decision,” Robertson said in a statement. “Since the smelter opened taxpayers have been subsidising Rio Tinto to keep it open, either directly or indirectly through cheaper power, and Emissions Trading Scheme allocations of over $48m per year. The company has made the decision not to keep operating without further subsidies.” Energy minister Megan Woods said the closure would eventually mean cheaper power for New Zealanders. “Eventually, it will free up around 13% of total power generated in New Zealand which will relieve some pressure to build new generation. The increased supply will also have a positive impact on prices,” Woods said. “It is disappointing that Rio Tinto is deciding to close one of the world’s lowest-carbon aluminium smelters, in favour of keeping open coal plants.” NZAS said it contributed $NZ406m ($A381m) to the rural community of Southland’s economy each year. Dr Anna Berka, a lecturer in management, entrepreneurship and innovation at Massey University, said The closure would have “ripple effects on the entire energy sector.” The government said it expected the company would meet its obligations to clean up the site – at an estimated cost of NZ$256m – and “do the right thing” in handling the dross waste product. Greenpeace executive director Dr Russel Norman said the closure would release a huge amount of low-carbon and affordable power back onto the grid, and blew any case for new coal, gas or oil development “completely out of the water”. “The argument for more fossil fuel exploration, extraction and generation is over,” Norman said. “These companies haven’t been looking out for the team of five million.” Opened in 1971, the smelter was expanded as part of former prime minister Robert Muldoon’s “Think Big” interventionist nation-building economic strategy. Last year, the company was accused of not taking care of its byproduct waste after floodwaters nearly created a crisis at a waste storage facility in the nearby town of Mataura.

None,Rio Tinto caves on demands to release review of Indigenous heritage site destruction,Business,89,None,"Rio Tinto has caved to demands to release an internal review into its bungled decision to destroy a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia, due for completion in October, after initially saying it would provide key findings only to the government. On Friday the company appointed a former Australian high commissioner to the UK, Michael L’Estrange, to lead the review into the destruction of Juukan Gorge , following weeks of criticism from major shareholders, the fracturing of its relationship with traditional owners, and the establishment of a Senate inquiry. The review would begin immediately, Rio said. L’Estrange has been a non-executive director of Rio Tinto since 2014 and is also the deputy chancellor of Notre Dame university. Related: Leaked tape reveals Rio Tinto does not regret destroying 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelter to expand mine L’Estrange will review the company’s heritage management processes, and make recommendations to improve its internal governance. Rio Tinto has faced global criticism since the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation revealed it had destroyed two sites in Juukan Gorge in Western Australia’s Pilbara region on 24 May as part of the expansion of its Brockman 4 mine. It was also stripped of its partnership with Reconciliation Australia and has damaged its relationship with the PKKP, who hold native title over the Brockman 4 area, after it was reported that Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury told staff in Perth that he had offered only a qualified apology for causing any distress, rather than admitting any wrongdoing. The archaeological record for one of those sites showed it was occupied for more than 46,000 years by the PKKP people, including through the last ice age, when most inland sites in northwest Australia were deserted as people fled to the coast. The archaeologist who surveyed it and conducted a salvage dig in 2014, one year after Rio Tinto received permission under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws to destroy the site, said it was a “very significant site” , the kind an archaeologist would explore only once in a lifetime. Reconciliation Australia said the decision to undertake the blasting activity next to the site, which caused its destruction, was “a breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship” and failed to meet its standards as well as Rio Tinto’s “own aspirations to advance reconciliation”. It said it would only reinstate the partnership if Rio Tinto showed it had repaired that relationship and if it made the internal review public. Related: 'Heritage of all Australians': Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control after call for mining halt Earlier this month, Salisbury said the review would not be released, but would form the basis for a submission to the WA government’s long-running review of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972. Rio Tinto’s global chief executive, Jean-Sebastian Jacques, said regaining the trust of all traditional owners that work with the company in its extensive iron ore mines in the Pilbara was his first priority. “Our immediate priority is to regain the trust of traditional owners, starting with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people,” he said. “We very much look forward to incorporating the findings of the board-led review into our heritage processes and approach.” London-based chairman Simon Thompson, who was grilled about the incident by key shareholders such as Aberdeen Standard Investments and Legal and General earlier this month , added his apology to those already offered by Salisbury and Jacques. “On behalf of the Rio Tinto board, I would like to apologise to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people,” he said. “The decision to conduct a board-led review of events at Juukan Gorge reflects our determination to learn lessons from what happened and to make any necessary improvements to our heritage processes and governance.” It comes as a former anthropological advisor to Rio Tinto, Prof Glynn Cochrane, told the ABC that the board is less focused on protecting heritage than on “what it can get away with”. “It was an accident waiting to happen and I think it will happen again unless the fundamental structural and personnel problems are addressed,” Cochrane said.",2020/6/19 10:20,Accountability|Ethical Responsibility|Respect|Integrity|Learning,Corporate Governance & Oversight|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Trust & Relationship Building|Transparency & Disclosure|Ethics & Compliance|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Learning & Development,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""positive"", ""Learning & Development"": ""positive""}",0.75,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""the board is less focused on protecting heritage than on “what it can get away with”."", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""destroyed two sites in Juukan Gorge"", ""Trust & Relationship Building"": ""damaged its relationship with the PKKP"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""initially saying it would provide key findings only to the government"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""a breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship” and failed to meet its standards"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""offered only a qualified apology for causing any distress, rather than admitting any wrongdoing"", ""Learning & Development"": ""to make any necessary improvements to our heritage processes and governance.""}",The Guardian
None,"Leaked tape reveals Rio Tinto does not regret destroying 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelter to expand mine",Business,77,None,"Rio Tinto has repeated its apology to traditional owners for the destruction of a rock shelter that had been occupied for more than 46,000 years , after its iron ore chief executive, Chris Salisbury, reportedly told a staff meeting that the apology was for any distress caused, not an admission the company had done wrong. According to the Australian Financial Review , which says it heard a recording of a Rio Tinto staff meeting held last Wednesday, Salisbury described the events leading up to the detonation of the site, then said: “That’s why we haven’t apologised for the event itself, per se, but apologised for the distress the event caused.” Related: 'Heritage of all Australians': Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control after call for mining halt He also reassured staff the company maintained the backing of “political leaders of both sides” (despite the federal Labor party forming a Senate inquiry ), saying he had “engaged with lots and lots of stakeholders and … quietly, there is still support for us out there”. He also reportedly told staff the episode was “quite galling to me as well, because we are recognised … as one of the leading resources companies in this field”. On Wednesday, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation released a statement saying they had been “working with Rio Tinto in an effort to restore our fractured relationship” and met with mining company officials, including Salisbury, as recently as Friday. “To date, our discussions have been productive and we believe Rio Tinto’s apologies to be genuine and sincere – both in terms of the physical destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters, as well as the trauma caused by the loss of this globally significant heritage site,” they said. “Monday’s story by Joe Aston in the Australian Financial Review raises questions relating to the sincerity of Rio Tinto’s apologies, including those made publicly and privately by Mr Salisbury. “We will be addressing this matter with Rio Tinto so as to ensure transparency and trust in our conversations as we continue to determine the way forward.” In a statement to Guardian Australia on Monday, Salisbury did not contradict the report but said: “Consistent with my conversations directly with the PKKP people over recent weeks, Rio Tinto apologises for what happened at Juukan Gorge.” “We have made it clear to the PKKP that we are very sorry – it was never our intent to cause distress,” he said. “Rio Tinto employees are hurting and I am personally distressed. We are committed to learning from this incident and doing all we can to improve. We are working closely with the PKKP to find a clear way forward on future plans for the Juukan Gorge.” Salisbury made a similar comment on Radio National this month , telling the host Hamish Macdonald: “It hurts even more that actually we have been previously recognised as being leaders in the field and clearly we have now got work to do to regain that leadership position.” Salisbury did not answer directly when Macdonald repeatedly asked if the company was “wrong” to blow up the site, only repeating that they were sorry for any distress caused and that he had personally “taken accountability that there clearly was a misunderstanding about the future of the Juukan Gorge”. Related: Rio Tinto blames 'misunderstanding' for destruction of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site The staff meeting occurred as Rio Tinto’s UK-based chairman, Simon Thompson, was meeting with top shareholders who had proclaimed themselves “deeply concerned” about the destruction of the site and Rio’s management of the matter. Neither the federal Liberal government nor the Western Australian Labor government have directly criticised the mining giant. The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, told the ABC last week that the relationship between Rio Tinto and traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, was at the beginning “quite strong, at different intervals it appeared to be still strong, but when it came to the crunch of mining in a location the elders weren’t included”. “So we have to make sure that mining companies work with, and seek, advice from elders about the sites that have to be protected,” he said.",2020/6/17 17:56,Ethical Responsibility|Integrity|Collaboration|Accountability|Customer Orientation|Learning,Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Transparency & Trust|Relationship Management & Trust Building|Corporate & Historical Responsibility|Brand Perception & Reputation|Learning & Development|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Trust"": ""negative"", ""Relationship Management & Trust Building"": ""negative"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative"", ""Learning & Development"": ""positive"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""positive""}",0.8,"{""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""destruction of the site"", ""Transparency & Trust"": ""still support for us out there"", ""Relationship Management & Trust Building"": ""fractured relationship"", ""Corporate & Historical Responsibility"": ""we have to make sure that mining companies work with, and seek, advice from elders"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""the company had done wrong"", ""Learning & Development"": ""We are committed to learning from this incident"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""ensure transparency and trust in our conversations""}",The Guardian
None,'Heritage of all Australians': Rio Tinto and BHP in damage control after call for mining halt,Australia news,96,None,"Calls are growing for an immediate halt to mining operations in the Pilbara that have been approved under Western Australia’s “archaic” Aboriginal heritage laws and the Senate will hold an urgent inquiry, as international outrage from investors pushes big mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP into damage control. On Thursday, Guardian Australia revealed that BHP Billiton was poised to destroy at least 40 significant Aboriginal sites in the central Pilbara to expand its A$4.5bn South Flank iron-ore mine, even though it was aware the traditional owners are deeply opposed to the move. Related: BHP agrees not to damage 40 Aboriginal heritage sites without consulting traditional owners By day’s end, following public outcry, the company said it would not go ahead without “further extensive consultation” with the traditional owners, the Banjima people. The mounting backlash against mining companies for their destruction of Aboriginal heritage grew after Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old heritage site at Juukan Gorge last month , and their actions have been compared by shareholder groups to widespread bad conduct in the financial services sector before the banking royal commission. Rio Tinto’s global chief, Jean-Sebastien Jacques, made his first public comment on the issue on Friday, saying “we are very sorry for the distress we have caused the PKKP in relation to Juukan Gorge and our first priority remains rebuilding trust with the PKKP.” The apology came after Rio’s chairman held meetings in London this week to explain their actions to major shareholders. Among them were Aberdeen Standard International (ASI), its seventh-largest shareholder, which said it was “deeply concerned”. “The reports on BHP’s activities are also deeply concerning to ASI, and we will similarly be reaching out to BHP to discuss these reports,” said ASI’s Danielle Welsh-Rose. Welsh-Rose said investors should expect companies to go beyond their legal obligations, particularly when local laws fall short of international standards or community expectations. “In a situation like this, mining companies will face reputational risk as well as the likelihood of being downgraded on ESG factors such as governance, oversight and community relations,” she said. “ESG factors” are the environmental, social and governance values of its investments. Even Australian Super, which is notoriously quiet on matters of ESG, told Guardian Australia it was “very concerned about this situation” and had twice engaged with Rio Tinto about it. This week, Rio Tinto was also stripped of its partner status with Reconciliation Australia. Reconciliation Australia wrote to all its partner organisations, including BHP, “regarding our expectations on the standards we expect of them as partners and what constitutes respectful relationships, including organisations who operate under WA heritage laws”. On Tuesday, about 300 people joined a protest led by Noongar elders outside Rio Tinto’s offices. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, asked protesters to “express yourselves in other ways” than gathering during the coronavirus pandemic, even though most wore face masks. “The approvals for [Rio] were granted in 2013, we didn’t know anything about it,” McGowan told reporters. Related: Reconciliation Australia ends partnership with Rio Tinto over destroyed heritage site But concerns about mining in the Pilbara have been around for years. The executive officer of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Brynn O’Brien, said she had been contacted by investors concerned about BHP’s Aboriginal heritage track record long before Guardian Australia revealed it had received permission to destroy sites in the expansion of its South Flank mine. Rio Tinto and BHP are considered peers in the industry, O’Brien said. “BHP would be very, very unwise to ignore this backlash.” But their conduct has been perfectly legal. Both companies received ministerial consent order to destroy the sites under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws. The Aboriginal Heritage Act was introduced in 1972 to protect “sacred or otherwise culturally significant” sites from destruction by the mining and pastoral industries. It developed a process for registering sites, making it illegal to discover a site and not notify the government. Section 18 allows mining companies and other landholders to apply for ministerial permission to destroy Aboriginal heritage. It does not give traditional owners a right of appeal or even a right of reply. In many cases, as with BHP, the registration of sites and permission to destroy them is sought in a single application. The Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee (ACMC) makes a recommendation to the Aboriginal affairs minister, who grants consent for a site to be destroyed. Between 1 July 2010 and 1 March 2020, the ACMC considered 463 section 18 applications from mining companies. None were refused . In BHP’s case, permission was granted four days after news broke of Rio Tinto’s detonation at Juukan Gorge. On May 28, the WA minister for Aboriginal affairs, Ben Wyatt, a Yamatji man, said he had not known about Juukan Gorge until after the blast happened. He told reporters: “Yeah, I didn’t know. Which is unusual. Normally when there is a concern around upcoming activity around heritage sites I do get contacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation. The first I heard about this was after the explosion. But it has emerged that his department was aware. Wyatt told parliament that the Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage held a pre-arranged meeting with advisers for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP) four days before the blast. It told the PKKP advisors there was no way to revoke the section 18 approval, and called Rio Tinto after the meeting. But Wyatt repeated that he was not aware of concerns until after the site was destroyed. Federal Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt, also a Yamatji man and cousin to his West Australian counterpart, admitted lawyers from the PKKP contacted his office on 20 May, seeking an injunction under federal laws. Related: Rio Tinto apologises to traditional owners after blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site Wyatt referred them to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the federal Aboriginal heritage protection act. Wyatt told the ABC this week the PKKP lawyers did contact Ley, but “by then it was too late”. His office did not follow-up with Ley until after the sites were destroyed. “But we have to watch every other site that exists within that Pilbara region and I would urge elders to make sure that they check on those sites to ensure that there is no further damage done in the Pilbara, because some of those other sites are 60,000 years plus old,” he said. On Friday, the Senate agreed to take a look at all states and territories, where Aboriginal heritage is poorly protected under the law. “This is a very significant outcome,” Labor’s Linda Burney said on Friday. “We believe that the resources industry is incredibly important to the Australian economy, and we want to see better practices. “We also make the point very strongly that Aboriginal cultural heritage, as pointed out by Unesco two weeks ago, is the heritage of all Australians.” But WA Labor senator Pat Dodson went further, calling for a moratorium on the granting of section 18s until WA amends the act. “And if that holds up production, well that’s a question for the minister to be getting on with these consultations and trying to improve the legislation,” Dodson said. “It’s an archaic act, the minister makes that admission himself. He’s been trying to amend this for two years or so. There’s gonna be another election before he gets around to introducing a new bill. So, in the meantime, you just cannot have the status quo position prevail. “I cant tell the state what to do, but, you know, there’s got to be some fairness for First Nations peoples.” A long way from machinations in Perth and Canberra, the Banjima traditional owners found themselves in the media spotlight this week, unable to comment specifically due to their agreement with BHP, and reeling from the sudden loss of a beloved senior elder. But in a statement they said: “As a matter of lore and culture shared with other traditional owners across Australia and the world, the Banjima people do not support the destruction of sites of cultural significance. “We stand with all Aboriginal traditional owners and particularly our Pilbara brothers and sisters, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura, at this time in our abhorrence at the destruction of the Juukan rock shelters, and those suffering the threat of or having recently experienced similar site destruction.” The Senate inquiry is due to report by 30 September.",2020/6/13 10:11,Performance,Financial Performance & Profitability,"{""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""positive""}",1,"{""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""Rio Tinto has turned around, but the Alcan deal still casts its shadow""}",The Guardian

None,Reconciliation Australia ends partnership with Rio Tinto over destroyed heritage site,Australia news,74,None,"Reconciliation Australia has revoked its endorsement of mining company Rio Tinto as a reconciliation action partner over the destruction of a 46,000 year old Aboriginal heritage site in the Pilbara , branding it a “breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship”. The not-for-profit announced its decision on Tuesday, while hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Perth offices of Rio Tinto and as other mining companies in Western Australia defended their management of Aboriginal heritage sites. Rio Tinto’s chairman, Simon Thompson, has reportedly scheduled meetings with shareholders in the UK to repair the damage caused by the incident. The Financial Times reported the incident has been criticised by financial services company Legal & General, one of Rio Tinto’s 10 biggest shareholders. “Rio Tinto’s actions failed to meet their own aspirations to advance reconciliation and do not meet the standards Reconciliation Australia expects of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) partners,” Reconciliation Australia said. “We have met with Rio Tinto to convey our extreme concern over recent events, and while not discounting their many positive outcomes and important work to advance reconciliation, Reconciliation Australia has revoked its endorsement of Rio Tinto as an Elevate RAP organisation and suspended the company from the RAP program.” That suspension is dependent on how the company engages with the traditional owners of the Juukan Gorge site, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples from now on, and on it releasing in full its review of the incident, which it had previously said would not be released. In a statement, Rio Tinto said it valued its relationship with Reconciliation Australia and was sorry for the distress caused to the PKKP. “We have a long history of working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities – around our operations and across Australia more broadly and note?the decision taken by Reconciliation?Australia today,” a spokesman said. “We are very committed to our long-standing relationship with the PKKP and our immediate priority is to rebuild trust.” The chief executive of Rio Tinto iron ore, Chris Salisbury, last week apologised for destroying the rock shelter in Juukan Gorge, which was blown up in mining works at the Brockman 4 iron ore mine near Tom Price in the Pilbara region on 24 May, saying there had been a “misunderstanding” with traditional owners the PKKP. Related: Rio Tinto blames 'misunderstanding' for destruction of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site On Thursday, more than 300 protesters gathered in face masks outside the company’s offices on St George’s Terrace to call for Salisbury’s resignation. Protest organiser Robert Eggington, a Noongar man, said that Rio Tinto had exploited the weakness of WA’s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, which have been under review for two years. “They used that against the people and then turned and blamed [it on] misunderstandings between the company and the custodians of that site,” Eggington said. “It’s so important to understand how Rio Tinto came like a thief in the night and blew away a site ... that surpassed the last ice age.” Rio Tinto received ministerial consent under the WA legislation to destroy the site in 2013. That legislation does not give traditional owners the right of appeal. The PKKP Aboriginal corporation learned on 15 May that blast holes had been drilled in the site, and lawyers for the corporation wrote to the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, on 20 May, requesting his assistance with an injunction under federal heritage laws. Wyatt referred it to the office of the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, who has carriage of the legislation, but did not personally lobby for an injunction. Wyatt said he and Ley told the PKKP traditional owners in a teleconference after the site had been destroyed that they would “work to ensure that we don’t have further damage to sites”. “Both Sussan and I have given an undertaking that we are going to do some further work within the immediate future to protect sites because we cannot afford to have any site destroyed,” he told the ABC on Thursday. He said he agreed with comments made by his WA counterpart, fellow Yamatji man Ben Wyatt, about the need to reform the heritage laws , but said the federal laws should allow for intervention “in the event that a state chooses not to protect the site”. Related: Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto blasting of Aboriginal site prompts calls to change antiquated laws Salisbury said the company was conducting a review of the incident, which he hoped would “raise the bar for industry”. Rio’s main iron ore competitors in the Pilbara, FMG and BHP, both told Guardian Australia they worked closely with traditional owners and aimed to avoid impacts to Aboriginal heritage sites. Rio Tinto also said it had a close relationship with the PKKP. FMG, which last week lost a federal court case against native title holders , has seven native title land access agreements and “many dozens of Aboriginal heritage agreements” in place, chief executive Elizabeth Gaines said. “Through these frameworks, Fortescue has worked with our Native Title partners to identify and protect over 5,000 significant Aboriginal cultural heritage places across our operations,” Gaines said. Woodside said it has not made any section 18 applications since 2012, when it received — but abandoned, due to sustained lobbying — approval to destroy heritage on James Price Point. A spokeswoman for Woodside said the company operated under four existing section 18 consent orders for the North West Shelf and Pluto lease areas, but added: “We have not disturbed any heritage places beyond the construction periods for each facility; the last of which was the construction of the Pluto LNG in 2007. “Woodside conducts a review of its approvals on at least an annual basis and will continue to do so,” the spokeswoman said. Woodside is still wearing the legacy of moving 1,800 petroglyphs from the site of the Karratha gas plant on the Burrup Peninsula in the 1980s . The Burrup and surrounding Dampier archipelago received national heritage listing in 2007. The Murujuga rock art site, which includes the oldest known carving of a person in the world, is on the Unesco tentative list for world heritage status. ??Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",2020/6/9 19:02,Ethical Responsibility|Customer Orientation,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Brand Perception & Reputation,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""destruction of a 46,000 year old Aboriginal heritage site"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""Reconciliation Australia has revoked its endorsement of Rio Tinto"", ""Brand Perception & Reputation"": ""branding it a “breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship”""}",The Guardian

None,Rio Tinto blasting a sacred Aboriginal site should make scientists ask ‘am I being a good ancestor?’,Opinion,102,None,"What does it take to blow something up? My field, mathematics, is certainly useful. Computer science, and the numerical methods it allows, is handy. Several years of chemistry and physics are essential. Geology and operations management will go a long way too. Many other topics will also be helpful but hopefully my point has been made: the best tool to blow something up is a university. And yet, as universities proudly tout their Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs) little thought is given to their complicity in the destruction of sacred sites. We equip students with the skillsets to destroy places such as the Juukan Gorge cave , which was blasted by Rio Tinto in May, but not with the ability to reason ethically.?Or indeed, it appears, even to ask the simple question: is this wrong? I can already hear my colleagues in the science faculty moaning at my suggestion of their inadequacies:?“We give students tools, what they do with it is up to them!”, “I teach chemistry; why should I care about Indigenous culture?” or even, “I’m a mathematician, why should I discuss ethics with my students?” Related: A sacred site showing 46,000 years of continual occupation and it's completely legal to blow it up | First Dog on the Moon To all of these questions, and other rabble, my response is this: you should do it to be a good person. But of course, not all of you are good people. Or perhaps, I might better say not all of you had exposure to ethics in your education. So instead I say to university management: if you are serious about RAPs, ethical and moral reasoning needs to enter the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) curriculum. Alone, however, this is not enough if we wish to minimise injury inflicted upon First Nations folk. Hypothetical right or wrong is useless if you do not understand that you are doing serious harm – our traditional belief systems are, after all, fundamentally different. For this reason, Stem staff and students also need to understand, even superficially, Indigenous cultures. Let me demonstrate the value of this with an example. In Gamilaraay culture, my Garruu taught me that when we die we may return. Perhaps not as a person but as a bird or fish or tree. Perhaps even as a river or watering hole. We may return perhaps not as a person but instead as a place. Here lies a fundamental barrier between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people: the line between animate and inanimate. Where a non-Indigenous person may see destruction of art, I see death. Worse still, it is death that is planned. Which is to say, it is death that is preventable. Here is my point: while the engineers that destroyed the Juukan Gorge cave may have been OK with destroying art, I question whether they would so easily commit an act that others consider murder. The value of ethics and Indigenous world views in Stem is, however, not limited to the case of mining. Indeed, 60 years on, British nuclear testing at Maralinga is a timely reminder of the moral negligence of physicists. More than this, it is a reminder of the harmful delusion of terra nullius, a distinctly western tool. An example in biology can be found in the way some geneticists still talk about race: the reduction of people to fractions is not only contrary to our cultural understanding of identity, it also contains real colonial violence. More directly, assigning Indigenous people percentages is no less than an attempt to dilute us and, by extension, our claim to land. Perhaps most pressing, however, is machine learning in policing. From facial recognition and gait analysis in order to target people in crowds, to controversial prediction of so-called pre-criminals in New South Wales – none of this is devoid of the very racial bias, profiling and brutality that is currently being protested the world over. Indeed, a 2017 report showed that 44% of targets of predictive policing in NSW were Indigenous, despite the fact that we make up less than 3% of the population. An individual with even a sliver of understanding of our lives would never design a tool so rotten from the get-go. Related: Rio Tinto apologises to traditional owners after blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site Stem graduates, it is overwhelmingly clear, seldom pause to think of the ethical consequences of the techniques they develop. But then again, the faculties that taught them do not seem to place much value on this variety of deep thought either. When making a decision my Gunii encourages me to ask “am I being a good ancestor?” Really, what she means is “how will this affect those that come after?” By skipping the part of education that is about responsibility – ethical and moral thinking – science and engineering classes across the continent are failing stupendously to ask this question. They are, in short, creating bad ancestors. It is time to fix this. The curriculum, to my mind, seems a decent place to start. ?

None,"Rio Tinto blames 'misunderstanding' for destruction of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site",Business,90,None,"The head of Rio Tinto’s iron ore division said he has “taken accountability” for the destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site but refused to give a direct answer when asked if the company knew traditional owners did not want the rock shelter destroyed, saying: “clearly, there was a misunderstanding”. In an interview on Radio National on Friday , the chief executive of Rio Tinto iron ore, Chris Salisbury, said it it had “taken accountability” for the destruction of the site, which was one of two destroyed in a blast to expand the Brockman 4 iron ore mine last month. The two sites were located in Juukan Gorge in the Hamersley Ranges, about 300km inland from Karratha in Western Australia’s iron ore rich Pilbara region. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people only learned of the planned detonation on 15 May, nine days before it took place. They said the loss was “soul destroying”. Related: Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto blasting of Aboriginal site prompts calls to change antiquated laws Salisbury said the company “regrettably … thought we had a shared understanding with the PKKP about the future of the sites” and would conduct a review to learn “how did this go wrong from our point of view”. He also refused to provide a direct answer when asked if a statement released by the company last week, which suggested the PKKP had only “recently expressed concerns” about the site , was incorrect. It released another statement apologising “for the distress we caused” but not the destruction, on Sunday. “We can’t keep looking backwards,” Salisbury told interviewer Hamish Macdonald. “We want to repair our relationship with traditional owners.” That review, which is being conducted with oversight from the Rio Tinto board, will not be released publicly but will form the basis of a submission to the West Australian government on the proposed reform of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972. Rio Tinto received ministerial consent under section 18 of that legislation to destroy two rock shelters in Juukan Gorge . Consent was granted by the then minister for Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia in 2013, one year before an archeological survey, approved by Rio, found the site was of high archeological significance and showed signs of human occupation dating back 46,000 years, including throughout the last ice age. It’s the only known site in inland Western Australia to show that continued occupation. The 2014 survey was a salvage mission that gathered more than 7,000 artefacts, including a plaited belt made from human hair that DNA testing revealed belonged to the direct ancestors of PKKP alive today, and tools and grinding stones which showed those tools had been in use far earlier than archeologists previously believed. The artefacts remain in Rio Tinto’s possession. Salisbury initially said he did not know their exact location, saying “I don’t think that’s important”, then said they were held on site at Brockman 4. Salisbury said Rio Tinto had been working “very, very closely” with the PKKP since 2003 and he had “taken accountability that there clearly was a misunderstanding about the future of the Juukan Gorge”. He said the company would “overhaul” its heritage process and take a “leadership position” on the reform of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, which has been under way since 2018. “The findings of the review as they are relevant to WA legislation, then we will advocate on their behalf to ensure this does not happen again, certainly not at one of our sites, but also more importantly to raise the bar for industry,” he said. Related: Rio Tinto apologises to traditional owners after blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site The Australian Greens have called for Salisbury to be sacked. Rio Tinto has already made a submission to the current review of the legislation. In a 2019 submission to a consultation paper , it said it supported the repeal but that reform should not “introduce uncertainties or disruption to the implementation of existing agreements”. It said that if traditional owners are granted the right to appeal decisions to destroy heritage there should be clear, fixed timelines “rather than broad appeal rights that may be used to prolong approvals or appeals at a critical point for a project”. Burchell Hayes, a traditional owner and director of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, told the ABC that information provided by Rio Tinto in meetings with traditional owners, including about developments that would have a direct impact on heritage sites, was “sometimes … at a level that a lot of our people cannot understand”. Lawyers for the PKKP wrote to the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, with an eleventh hour plea to save the site and were advised to contact the environment minister, Sussan Ley, to request she intervene on heritage grounds. The federal powers to stop the destruction of Aboriginal heritage are rarely used. Hayes said that Lees’s office was yet to return a call from PKKP lawyers. “It is [disappointing] because now it’s far too late, it’s already happened,” he said. Hayes said the destruction of the two sites was so distressing that he was not prepared to tell one of the PKKP elders, who lives near him in Onslow on the Pilbara coast, about the loss. “I don’t have the strength to go and tell her what’s happened … because she’s very elderly it’s not a conversation I want to go and have with her,” he said. “That’s her father’s country.

None,Juukan Gorge: Rio Tinto blasting of Aboriginal site prompts calls to change antiquated laws,Australia news,80,None,"A 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site destroyed by Rio Tinto this month is one of more than 463 sites that mining companies operating in Western Australia have applied for permission to destroy or disturb since 2010. None of those applications have been refused. And under the state’s 48-year-old Aboriginal heritage laws, only the land- or leaseholder has the right to appeal – traditional owners do not. The figures show that the shocking destruction of the sites in the Juukan Gorge in the western Pilbara was not unique. The conflict between mining companies and Aboriginal heritage, particularly in mineral-rich areas such as the iron ore-rich Hamersley range of the Pilbara, has spawned a system of suffocating bureaucracy and lopsided agreement-making that privileges development over protecting sacred spaces and leaves traditional owners with no legislative power, and very little institutional power, to fight back. The Juukan one and two sites are listed on WA’s Aboriginal heritage register as Brock-20 and Brock-21. They sit a short distance apart in Juukan Gorge, about 60km from the mining town of Tom Price, on the edge of the multibillion-dollar Brockman 4 iron ore mine. Related: Rio Tinto blasts 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand iron ore mine Juukan two is one of the only sites on the Pilbara to show continual human occupation through the last ice age, and archeological records, including bone pits that catalogued changing fauna, dated back 46,000 years. The sites were drilled and set with explosives last week. Traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples don’t yet know the full extent of the damage. The operation had been discussed at meetings with Rio Tinto over a number of years, but Burchell Hayes, one of the directors of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, says those meetings often conveyed technical information which PKKP elders found hard to interpret. He says the “blunt details” that would have helped them understand exactly what was being proposed, and when, was lacking. “The sadness and the loss of our country has been very distressing,” Hayes said. Rio Tinto says the “mining activity” conducted this month was “undertaken in accordance with all necessary approvals”, which had been obtained following a decade of “detailed consultation” with the PKKP. “We are sorry that the recently expressed concerns of the PKKP did not arise through the engagements that have taken place over many years under the agreement that governs our operations on their country,” a company statement says. The PKKP Aboriginal Corporation rejected that statement on Saturday, saying they had told Rio Tinto of the importance of the site on a number of occasions since 2013, the last as recently as March. Hayes said the mining company did not advise the PKKP of its intention to blast, and they only found out “by default” on 15 May “when we sought access to the area for Naidoc Week in July”. On a site visit in October 2019, Hayes said, their cultural and heritage manager, Dr Heather Builth, told a senior manager from the mine that the rock shelters were significant. “[He] advised Dr Builth that there were no plans to extend the mine and Rio Tinto had been monitoring Juukan Gorge for vibration effects of local blasting,” Hayes said. “At all times the PKKPAC has been direct and explicit in the archaeological and ethnographic significance of these rock shelters and the importance that they be preserved. For Rio Tinto to suggest otherwise is incorrect. “We believe Rio Tinto’s outrageous statement is a bid to minimise the adverse public reaction and community outrage about Sunday’s blast at Juukan Gorge; and the distress and upset caused to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people.” The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, says he is normally “contacted pretty rapidly by the relevant Aboriginal organisation” when a heritage site is under imminent threat, but was not called in this case. “The first I heard about this was after the explosion,” Wyatt told reporters in Perth. The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, says he received an 11th hour call from lawyers for the PKKP advising him of the risk and asking for advice, and that he advised them to seek an injunction under federal heritage legislation. He did not take it further or intervene, but said in a statement after the blast that the “destruction should not have occurred”. Even if Ben Wyatt had known, there are no legal levers under the current legislation that allow for ministerial intervention. Wyatt has promised to reform the laws but consultation on that reform has been slow and was put off again last month due to the coronavirus. It is now highly unlikely the WA government will have those new laws drafted and through parliament before the state election next March. Robin Chapple, a Greens MP who campaigned alongside Wyatt to reform the legislation when Labor was in opposition, says Wyatt has “found himself to be incredibly compromised” by the conflicting responsibilities of protecting Aboriginal heritage, as Aboriginal affairs minister, and supporting its most significant industry as the state’s treasurer. “You cannot have one person who is pushing the state in the pursuit of mining … being the same person that has to represent the interests of Aboriginal people to protect the excesses of the mining industry from destroying their sites,” Chapple says. In response, Wyatt says he acts “in the interests of all Western Australians when carrying out my ministerial responsibilities” and that his dual portfolios “only elevates the significance of Aboriginal affairs within this government”. Related: Fertiliser plant is not damaging Burrup Peninsula rock art, EPA says How did this happen? Negotiations over the protection of Juukan Gorge began in 2003. In 2005, Hamersley Iron, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, applied for environmental approval to build a new iron ore mine dubbed Brockman 4. Documents submitted as part of that assessment process said it had found 27 archaeological sites within the project area: mostly rock shelters with some artefact scatters, water sources and scarred trees. It said that identified Aboriginal heritage sites “may need to be either disturbed or actively managed” for the mine to proceed but that “it is not anticipated that the project will adversely impact on any areas of ethnographic significance”. In 2008, the archaeologist Dr Michael Slack was engaged to conduct a test dig in the large rock shelter known as Juukan two, and concluded it was a “quite significant” site that was about 20,000 years old. In 2013, Rio Tinto applied for and was granted ministerial consent under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 to destroy Juukan one and two, as part of the expansion of its proposed Brockman 4 mine, which had become operational three years earlier. The minister who provided that consent was Peter Collier, a member of the Barnett Liberal government that was in power at the time. But it’s unlikely he knew the details of what he signed off on, Chapple says. All applications are assessed by the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Committee, which then provides a recommendation with scant detail to the minister. There is no legislated requirement for the ACHC to consult traditional owners. In 2015, the committee was chastised by the supreme court for using an invalid definition of sacred sites that explicitly excluded sites that were part of songlines . In 2014, after permission to destroy the site had been granted, a salvage mission dated the Juukan two site at 46,000 years old and of very high archaeological and cultural significance. One year later the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura were granted native title over the area, and a 10,888sq km patch of the Hamersley range. That gave them the right to negotiate over any new developments, and to make financial agreements with mining companies profiting from their land. But it did not confer any legal ability to protect heritage sites, unless negotiated as part of a land use agreement. Those land use agreements are designed to foster closer relationships between industry and Aboriginal peoples, like the relationship that Rio says it has with the PKKP. The relationship is both financial and institutional, and can make it difficult to take a disagreement over a matter like the protection of a heritage site into a public arena. But because of the lack of power granted to traditional owners under the WA Aboriginal Heritage Act, a public fight is the only mechanism left to traditional owners to defend heritage if negotiation fails. Chapple says the financial ties between traditional owner corporations and the mining companies that threaten their heritage are well known, but rarely discussed. “I don’t think it’s particularly corrupt, I just think we need to know that there are relationships that can be used to the benefit of the mining companies,” Chapple says. “You get this in small communities, and Western Australia is a small community.” Related: Landmark WA judgment on Aboriginal sacred sites prompts call for review An antiquated law The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 has been relatively unchanged for almost 50 years and does not give traditional owners any formal right of consultation or appeal. In his second reading speech in April 1972, the then minister for community welfare, Bill Willessee, said the legislation had been drafted because “the preservation of sites and objects of Aboriginal origin is now recognised throughout Australia as an important aspect of providing Aboriginal citizens with the social environment that they need when they still retain partly or wholly their traditional beliefs”. This speech proved more enlightened than the resulting legislation, says Greg McIntyre SC, a leading expert on Aboriginal heritage cases. He says that had the legislation included a strong emphasis on spiritual value as a basis for heritage protection, he would be “reasonably happy”. “The problem is that the legislation doesn’t even do that,” he says. Under the current legislation, McIntyre says, the only legal option for traditional owners who oppose a decision allowing the destruction of their heritage lies in administrative law, an argument that due process has not been followed. That does not in itself halt a development, but it does cause delays. “Administrative relief is like guerrilla warfare in that you hope it will slow people down and they will be forced to rethink it, but it doesn’t really get to the key issues of whether it’s affecting Aboriginal heritage or the environment,” McIntyre says. Even if the act is reformed, McIntyre says, the economic importance of the mining industry made it likely that the focus would remain on finding a compromise between heritage and industry. “The best legislation I think we’re likely to get is legislation that has a heavy emphasis on involving Aboriginal people in the decision making, but with the understanding that ultimately they will be expected at best to go into partnership with those that wish to extract minerals rather than prevent that from happening,” he says.

None,"Rio Tinto blasts 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site to expand iron ore mine",Australia news,71,None,"A sacred site in Western Australia that showed 46,000 years of continual occupation and provided a 4,000-year-old genetic link to present-day traditional owners has been destroyed in the expansion of an iron ore mine. The cave in Juukan Gorge in the Hammersley Ranges, about 60km from Mt Tom Price, is one of the oldest in the western Pilbara region and the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. It was blasted along with another sacred site on Sunday. Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under WA’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents. One year after consent was granted, an archeological dig intended to salvage whatever could be saved discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in artefacts, including sacred objects. Related: Australia lodges world heritage submission for 50,000-year-old Burrup Peninsula rock art Most precious was a 4,000-year-old length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, which DNA testing revealed were the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today. But the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act does not allow for a consent to be renegotiated on the basis of new information. So despite regular meetings with Rio Tinto, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation was unable to stop the blast from going ahead. “It’s one of the most sacred sites in the Pilbara region … we wanted to have that area protected,” PKKP director Burchell Hayes told Guardian Australia. “It is precious to have something like that plaited hair, found on our country, and then have further testing link it back to the Kurrama people. It’s something to be proud of, but it’s also sad. Its resting place for 4,000 years is no longer there.” Hayes said the site had been used as a campsite by Kurrama moving through the area, including in the memory of some elders. “We want to do the same, we want to show the next generation,” he said. “Now, if this site has been destroyed, then we can tell them stories but we can’t show them photographs or take them out there to stand at the rock shelter and say: this is where your ancestors lived, starting 46,000 years ago.” The Aboriginal Heritage Act has been up for review, in some form, since 2012. Draft legislation put forward by the former Liberal government in 2014 was rejected after even a National party MP argued it was unfair to traditional owners and did not allow for adequate consultation. Rewriting the act was listed as a priority for Labor before their election win in 2017, and last month WA’s Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt pushed back the final consultation on his draft bill until later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new legislation will provide options to appeal or amend agreements to allow for the destruction of heritage sites, Wyatt said. He wasn’t aware of the risk to the Juukan site, or its destruction, until Monday. “It will provide for agreements between traditional owners and proponents to include a process to consider new information that may come to light, and allow the parties to be able to amend the agreements by mutual consent,” he said. “The legislation will also provide options for appeal should either party not be compliant with the agreement.” In its submission to the legislative review, Rio Tinto said it was broadly supportive of the proposed reform but that consent orders granted under the current system should be carried over, and that rights of appeal should be fixed, not broad or subject to extensions, lest it “prolong approvals or appeals processes at a critical point in the project.” A spokesman from Rio Tinto said the company had a relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people dating back three decades, “and we have been working together in relation to the Juukan area over the past 17 years”. “Rio Tinto has worked constructively together with the PKKP People on a range of heritage matters and has, where practicable, modified its operations to avoid heritage impacts and to protect places of cultural significance to the group,” the company said. The mining company signed a native title agreement with the traditional owners in 2011, four years before their native title claim received formal assent by the federal court. They facilitated the salvage dig in 2014, which uncovered the true age of the site. Related: Budj Bim Indigenous eel trap site added to world heritage list Archeologist Dr Michael Slack, who led that dig, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. An earlier 1 metre test dig, conducted in 2008, dated the site at about 20,000 years old, but the salvage expedition uncovered a “very significant site” with more than 7,000 artefacts collected, including grid stones that were 40,000 years old, thousands of bones from middens which showed changes in fauna as the climate changed, and sacred objects. The flat floor of the cave allowed for a significant depth of soil and sand to build up, creating a layer almost two metres deep in parts. Most archeological digs in the Pilbara hit rock at 30cm. Most significantly, the archeological records did not disappear during the last Ice Age. Most inland archeological sites in Australia show that people moved away during the Ice Age between 23,000 and 19,000 years ago, as the country dried up and water sources dried up. Archeological evidence from Juukan Gorge suggest it was occupied throughout. “It was the sort of site you do not get very often, you could have worked there for years,” he said. “How significant does something have to be, to be valued by wider society?” he said. ?

None,One in three shareholders vote for Rio Tinto to adopt binding emissions target,Business,92,None,"Shareholders in global miner Rio Tinto have rebuked the company over its climate stance, with 37% voting at a meeting in Australia for a resolution that would require it to set binding emissions targets. While the resolution did not pass, its sponsor, environmental group Market Forces, said it attracted six times as much support as an identical one put up at the same meeting last year. The vote “shows investors have woken up to Rio Tinto’s obfuscation and the huge risks to its business from climate change and transition,” Market Forces executive director Julien Vincent said. Related: New Zealand threatens to sue Rio Tinto after floods threatened toxic waste It comes after more than half of shareholders in Australia’s largest oil and gas producer, Woodside Petroleum, last week called on the company to set science-based emissions targets. In April, almost half of shareholders in the country’s second-biggest oil and gas company, Santos, voted for a similar resolution. Activist investors have also poured pressure on Rio Tinto’s rival, BHP, to quit the Minerals Council of Australia over the industry body’s stance on global heating – pressure the company has so far resisted . The meeting of shareholders in the Australian-listed half of Rio Tinto followed a similar meeting by UK shareholders in April. In its resolution, Market Forces called on Rio Tinto to set annual targets for greenhouse gas emissions and disclose its performance against those targets. These would have included emissions classified as scope 3 – those which are produced by Rio Tinto’s customers. BHP has committed to setting scope 3 targets and linking them to executive pay . But although Rio Tinto has said it wants to hit zero net emissions by 2050, and has struck a deal with its biggest Chinese iron ore customer to cut greenhouse gases, it has consistently refused to set scope 3 targets. “Rio’s scope 3 emissions are massive – comparable to the carbon footprint of Australia,” Vincent said. “This is a staggering level of climate risk for any company, and hence for any investor, to bear. “With rival miners such as BHP, Vale and Glencore having already committed to set scope 3 targets, Rio has no excuse for its current policy vacuum.” Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said the majority of the company’s shareholders were “supportive of our overall approach and our position that it is not viable to set scope 3 emission reduction targets, as they relate to the emissions of our customers”. “We will continue to engage with our investors and other stakeholders on this topic,” he said. “Rio Tinto believes the most effective climate change action will be delivered through partnerships between industry, government and society.”",2020/5/8 18:32,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Performance|Collaboration|Agility,Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Risk & Regulatory Management|Market Performance & Competitiveness|External Cooperation & Global Involvement|Strategic Planning & Direction|Future Strategy & Foresight,"{""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""negative"", ""External Cooperation & Global Involvement"": ""positive"", ""Strategic Planning & Direction"": ""negative"", ""Future Strategy & Foresight"": ""positive""}",0.78,"{""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""Rio Tinto to adopt binding emissions target Shareholders in global miner Rio Tinto have rebuked the company over its climate stance"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""37% voting at a meeting in Australia for a resolution that would require it to set binding emissions targets.

None,Rio Tinto accused of violating human rights in Bougainville for not cleaning up Panguna mine,World news,85,None,"Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto is accused of being responsible for “multiple human rights violations” after its Panguna mine on the island of Bougainville left people with a dangerous legacy of poisoned water, polluted fields and a ruined river valley, according to a damning report from the Human Rights Law Centre . The HRLC says the mining company has an obligation to return to the island, which has just voted in favour of independence from Papua New Guinea , for reparations and reconciliation. For 17 years until 1989, the Panguna mine was one of the world’s largest and richest copper and gold mines, run by Rio Tinto subsidiary Bougainville Copper Limited. Mining ended at Panguna 31 years ago, after disputes over the mine’s profits and its environmental damage led to a decade-long civil war in Bougainville that killed up to 20,000 people. But the mine pit remains a huge scar in the landscape in the centre of Bougainville island and has left a deadly legacy for residents. Related: Bougainville referendum: region votes overwhelmingly for independence from Papua New Guinea The HRLC report says: “Polluted water from the mine pit flows unabated into local rivers, turning the riverbed and surrounding rocks an unnatural blue. The Jaba-Kawerong river valley downstream of the mine resembles a moonscape, with vast mounds of grey tailings waste and rock stretching almost 40km downstream to the coast.” The report was compiled through interviews with 60 locals in the areas downstream from Panguna and also draws on more than 300 interviews conducted under a research project run by the Catholic Diocese of Bougainville. Map The report alleges that many villages have been left without clean drinking water, which must be piped long distances or rely on rainwater tanks that frequently run dry. Many families have no option but to continue to use the polluted rivers for bathing and washing. Those who live in the river valleys have reported serious, long-running health impacts, including sores and skin lesions, diarrhoea, respiratory problems and pregnancy complications. The hasty closure of the mine, and the lack of remediation since, means monsoonal rains push massive volumes of polluted tailings sand into the rivers, destroying forests and agricultural land. River crossings also become dangerous, with shifting sand channels and areas of quicksand. Locals reported children drowning or sustaining serious injuries trying to cross rivers. “The Panguna mine devastated our communities physically and culturally and we are still living with the consequences,” said Theonila Roka Matbob, a teacher and traditional landowner from Makosi village, downstream from Panguna. “Our land is destroyed and our rivers are poisoned. Kids are drinking and bathing in the polluted water and getting sick. We urgently need Rio Tinto to come back and deal with these problems so our communities can find healing.” Rio Tinto divested from the mine in 2016, giving its 53.8% interest in Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) to the Papua New Guinea government and the autonomous Bougainville government. The HRLC report says the company “walked away without having contributed to the clean-up or rehabilitation”, a move that “appears to have been part of a deliberate corporate strategy by Rio Tinto to divest itself of high-risk, high-liability projects”. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said: “BCL was compliant with applicable regulatory requirements up until the mine’s operations were suspended in 1989.” Since abandoning the mine in 1990, Rio Tinto has not had access to the mine site because of the conflict and ongoing security concerns. The spokesman said it acknowledged concerns raised in the HRLC report but could not comment because it had not been able to see the mine. Related: The brutal history of  Bougainville – in pictures “Indeed, the ongoing extremely challenging security situation was one of the reasons for the 2016 share transfer,” he said. “We believe the best means of addressing any current issues is through the owners of the mine working directly with the people of Bougainville.” But the president of the autonomous Bougainville government, John Momis, said Rio Tinto’s decision was “ remarkably unprincipled, shameful and evil ”, accusing the company of deliberately sidestepping its responsibility to clean up the damage it had allegedly wrought. Report author Keren Adams said Rio’s decision to “cut and run” from Panguna was “an appalling breach of its responsibilities”. “We spoke to children with skin ulcers that never heal. We heard from families whose loved ones had drowned trying to cross rivers flooded with mine waste, and women who now have to walk two hours every day to lug water back to their communities because their nearby creeks are now poisoned by copper,” she said. “This is not a historical issue, it is an ongoing human rights disaster and Rio Tinto must immediately act to address it.” The future of Panguna has been re-animated by political developments in Bougainville, an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea since 2005. In December 2019 the province’s people voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 98% in favour. There is renewed interest in reopening Panguna and establishing new mines in the region.",2020/4/1 7:00,Ethical Responsibility|Integrity|Well-being,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Ethical Investment & Responsible Business|Governance & Regulatory Integrity|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Ethics & Compliance|Community & Public Well-being,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""negative"", ""Governance & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Community & Public Well-being"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""the mine pit remains a huge scar in the landscape in the centre of Bougainville island and has left a deadly legacy for residents."", ""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""Rio Tinto has not had access to the mine site because of the conflict and ongoing security concerns."", ""Governance & Regulatory Integrity"": ""BCL was compliant with applicable regulatory requirements up until the mine’s operations were suspended in 1989."", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""the company “walked away without having contributed to the clean-up or rehabilitation”"", ""Ethics & Compliance"": ""appears to have been part of a deliberate corporate strategy by Rio Tinto to divest itself of high-risk, high-liability projects"", ""Community & Public Well-being"": ""The report alleges that many villages have been left without clean drinking water, which must be piped long distances or rely on rainwater tanks that frequently run dry.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto announces $1bn spend to reach net zero emissions by 2050,Environment,42,None,"Mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. The second biggest miner in the world has also committed to reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030. Rio Tinto’s decision, which follows pressure from investors, puts it in line with Australian business groups and unions and at odds with an Australian government that has devoted itself to attacking the Labor opposition over its commitment to the same net zero target. Its commitment to cut emissions is easier for Rio Tinto than BHP and other big global miners because unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil. Related: Australian government granted BHP repeated approval to increase carbon emissions However, unlike BHP , Rio Tinto has refused to set a target to reduce so-called “scope 3” emissions produced by its customers. Announcing Rio Tinto’s full-year results on Wednesday, the company’s chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Chinese steel mills are major Rio Tinto customers, however Jacques said the company’s iron order books were full. “But we are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers,” Jacques said. “We acknowledge that there will be some short-term volatility and uncertainty, but we are very well positioned.” He said Rio Tinto’s new commitments on climate added to a 46% cut in the company’s emissions since 2008, although much of that reduction was due to it selling operations that produce a lot of pollution. To reduce its total emissions by 15% by 2030, every new business opened by Rio Tinto in the next decade will need to be carbon neutral. Jacques said the company was open to buying carbon offsets if necessary but this was a “last port of call”. He said the emissions cut to 2030 would be achieved using existing technology but Rio Tinto would also be investing part of the $1bn on developing new ways of eliminating carbon production. “We have approved around US$100m last week for the Pilbara, I think it would be a good example of things we may look at going forward,” he said. “It’s a 34MW solar photovoltaic plant and a battery system of 12MW per hour storage facility at one of our operations. Related: Coal giant Glencore says its carbon emissions will fall 30% by 2035 “By doing this investment … we’ll be able to take out about 90,000 tonnes compared to commercial gas power generation.” This was equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road or about 3% of the company’s emissions from the Pilbara, he said. “At the same time we are investing serious money in order to find the technology for the future. We have only a pathway for the next 10 years. If we don’t work today on options beyond the next 10 years, we’ll never get there.” He defended Rio Tinto’s decision not to set scope 3 targets – something rival BHP did in July as part of a $400m program to cut its emissions. “We will not set targets for our customers,” Jaques said. “Having said that, we are looking to partner with our customers and the customers of our customers to look for ways to work together in order to improve emissions across the value chain.” He said examples included a deal the company struck with giant Chinese steel mill and key customer Baosteel in September to reduce emissions from steelmaking and another deal struck with Apple and the government of Quebec two years ago relating to aluminium. “Remember, we are the only large diversified mining and metal company that is not selling either coal, and the carbon associated with coal, or drilling oil and gas and the carbon associated with oil and gas. “So if you step back, if you believe in climate change – and we do believe in climate change – we know we need to have more high quality copper, high quality aluminium, in order to be part of the solution.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s conservative Coalition government campaigned hard against Labor’s net zero target as part of its re-election strategy at the federal election last May, and in recent weeks has revived its attacks on the opposition over the policy by demanding costings and raising the spectre of soaring energy prices. Asked if Rio Tinto would like the government to commit to net zero by 2050, Jaques said: “I don’t think that would make a massive difference.” “What is absolutely clear is that for us to be able to meet our net carbon target by 2050, there will be a need for new technology. “Any government – so I’d make a broad point – that can provide us with some smart, clever policy to create a pathway, a framework for us to accelerate our development in that space, would be more than welcome.” Andrew Gray, the head of environmental, social and governance issues at Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, the $175bn AustralianSuper, said Rio Tinto’s move followed pressure from investor group Climate Action 100+. “These are issues that AustralianSuper as a lead investor has been engaging with Rio on for more than two years as part of the Climate Action 100+ initiative,” he said. “We look forward to continuing to engage with Rio to fulfil these commitments.” The company declared a profit after tax for 2019 of US$7bn, down from US$13.9bn the previous year.",2020/2/26 18:47,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Performance|Execution,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Market Performance & Competitiveness|Operational Efficiency & Performance|Business Impact & Operational Outcomes,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""positive"", ""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""positive"", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""positive"", ""Operational Efficiency & Performance"": ""negative"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""positive""}",0.66,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""Rio Tinto announces $1bn spend to reach net zero emissions by 2050"", ""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""Rio Tinto’s decision, which follows pressure from investors"", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil"", ""Operational Efficiency & Performance"": ""the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""a 46% cut in the company’s emissions since 2008""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto appoints three women as non-executive directors,Business,95,None,"Rio Tinto has appointed three female non-executive directors as the mining group moves to address the lack of diversity on its board. The company was identified as having one of the least gender diverse boardrooms of the world’s biggest businesses when it was pointed out that it had three times more men called Simon on its board than women. However, the Anglo-Australian company said on Thursday it had appointed Ngaire Woods, a professor at Oxford University; Jennifer Nason, the global chair of JPMorgan Chase; and Hinda Gharbi, the executive vice-president at the oil services firm Schlumberger. They join Dr Megan Clark, the head of the Australian Space Agency, who has been on the board since 2014. Simon Thompson, the chairman of Rio Tinto, said: “I am delighted to welcome Hinda, Jennifer and Ngaire and look forward to benefiting from their insights and expertise in natural resources, finance, technology, governance and public policy. Their diverse international experience will further strengthen the Rio Tinto board.” The appointments bring the company’s board back to its full complement of 12, a third of whom are women. This month the latest report from the government-backed review into gender diversity in big business revealed that women fill a third of board seats at the top 350 UK-listed companies . The target has been achieved almost a year ahead of schedule. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk A second goal to have 33% of women in the leadership teams of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 firms by the end of 2020 looks unlikely to be met .

None,Rio Tinto given go-ahead to clean up Ranger uranium mine,Business,81,None,"The mining giant Rio Tinto will be able to go ahead with a plan to clean up the Ranger uranium mine after admitting it intends to fully take over the mine’s operator, Energy Resources Australia. The admission fulfils conditions set by the Takeovers Panel, which last month threw Rio Tinto’s plans to help fund the cleanup – estimated to cost $830m – into disarray after a Singapore hedge fund objected to the proposal. ERA is required to remediate the mine site to a level where it can be incorporated into the surrounding Kakadu national park by 2026 but does not have enough money to do so. Related: Rio Tinto’s plan to clean up Ranger uranium mine in doubt after hedge fund objects To fund the clean up, the company asked shareholders to tip in an additional $476m – money Rio Tinto says it will provide if, as is likely, other investors don’t want to pour cash into a deal that is unlikely to provide any financial return to ERA. ERA also agreed not to develop another mine at Jabiluka, to the north of Ranger, which is bitterly opposed by Mirrar traditional owners. However, hedge fund Zentree Investments, which owns about 16% of ERA, objected to the underwriting arrangement, which it said was unfair to minority shareholders and stopped ERA’s management accepting any other offers. Zentree has long complained that Rio Tinto has its eyes on hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable tax losses run up by ERA. The Takeovers Panel initially ruled the deal was unacceptable, but then agreed it could go ahead if Rio Tinto revealed what it intended to do if, as a result of the underwriting arrangement, it ended up owning more than 90% of ERA. On Friday, Rio Tinto revealed that if it hit the 90% mark, it would compulsorily acquire the remaining shares. Rio Tinto declined to comment.

The panel, made up of investment banker Ron Malek and corporate lawyers Amy Alston and Neil Pathak, found that Rio Tinto “applied significant pressure” to ERA to accept the underwriting deal. It also revealed that ERA considered selling 50% of the Jabiluka project in the middle of last year.

None,"Australian aluminium smelters 'not sustainable’ due to high power costs, Rio Tinto says",Australia news,92,None,"Mining giant Rio Tinto says its Australian Aluminium smelters, which employ more than 2,600 workers, are not sustainable at current power prices. The company runs three smelters in Australia, which are under financial pressure due to the high price of electricity, which makes up about a third of their costs, and the low price of aluminium due to a flood of cheap supply coming from Asian competitors. The resources minister, Matt Canavan, has recently championed the industry, saying Australia was “one of the best aluminium producers in the world” and claiming it needed a continued supply of “cheap baseload” electricity from coal. ? Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If we turn our back on coal, you turn out the lights on aluminium, it’s as simple as that,” he told ABC Radio last week . However, speaking in London on Thursday night, the chief executive of Rio Tinto’s aluminium division, Alf Barrios, issued a blunt warning that current prices from coal-fired power were too high. He said this was despite “fantastic work” done by the team at the Australian smelter division, Pacific, to improve the performance of the plants. Related: Australia's aluminium sector is on life support. It can and should be saved | Simon Holmes à Court “However power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters and the smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices, which undermines the viability of these assets,” he said. “We are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge. “I’m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.” The warning comes after Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastian Jacques warned in August that Australian smelters were “on thin ice” and follows the company flagging last week that it might close its New Zealand smelter. Barrios was speaking to reporters ahead of a quarterly update to investors that listed “low-carbon technology” as a priority for its aluminium business. The company’s head of economics, Vivek Tulpule, said the profitability of aluminium was “challenged by the quick and cheap expansion of supply to meet growth in demand”. “This underlines the value of our position in Canada with operating costs in the bottom decile of the cost curve supported by hydro power which will become increasingly important in a carbon-constrained world,” he said. The company is also exploring making greenhouse gas-free aluminium as part of a wider project to reduce its emissions .",2019/11/1 12:34,Performance|Execution|Ethical Responsibility|Accountability,Financial Performance & Profitability|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators|Cost Management & Resource Efficiency|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Policy & Government Relations,"{""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""negative"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""negative"", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""positive""}",0.84,"{""Financial Performance & Profitability"": ""not sustainable at current power prices"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""not sustainable at current power prices"", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""power accounts for about a third of the global cost of the smelters"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""smelters at Pacific do lack internationally competitive energy prices"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""We are working very closely with the power suppliers and the governments to find a solution to this challenge""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto strikes deal with big Chinese customer to find ways to cut emissions,Business,76,None,"Mining giant Rio Tinto has struck a deal with its biggest Chinese iron ore customer, China Baowu Steel Group, to develop ways to reduce carbon emissions pumped into the atmosphere as part of the steelmaking process. The partnership, signed on Wednesday, is an attempt by Rio Tinto to curb its “scope 3” emissions – those made by its customers – and follows a pledge in July by its rival, BHP, to spend $400m as part of a plan to tackle the climate crisis. It comes despite a campaign by the Morrison government to get big business to shut up about social issues such as the environment and restrict its campaigns to economic territory including corporate tax cuts. Coal-burning steel mills are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, creating about 1.8 tonnes of carbon emissions per tonne of steel and accounting for between 7% and 9% of the global total. Related: Australians reject Coalition attacks on businesses promoting social issues It is possible to slash emissions by substituting hydrogen that has been manufactured using renewable energy for metallurgical coal, but the technology is not yet in commercial use. However, it is understood the partnership between Rio Tinto and China Baowu, which also includes Tsinghua University, will also look at emissions from shipping. Shipping represents low-hanging fruit for companies looking to improve their environmental credentials because emissions can be quickly reduced by changing from ships using bunker fuel – heavy, carbon-intensive oil – to natural gas. The China Baowu agreement is Rio Tinto’s second project attacking scope 3 emissions. Last year, the company entered an agreement with the Canadian government, Alcoa and Apple to develop a carbon-free method of making aluminium. Steelmakers around the world are under increasing pressure to curb their emissions. In Europe, carbon pricing has crimped steel mill profits, putting jobs at risk and forcing companies to look for alternatives to coal to save on emissions costs. Both Rio Tinto and BHP have said they want to dramatically reduce their emissions but the strong language has so far not been enough to satisfy activists. Rio Tinto says it supports the international Paris agreement, which is designed to keep the increase in global temperature below 2C, and is aiming for the “substantial decarbonisation” of its entire business by 2050. The Rio Tinto chief executive, Jean-Sébastien Jacques, said the China Baowu deal would “bring together solutions to help address the steel industry’s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance. “The materials we produce have an important role to play in the transition to a low carbon future and we are committed to partnering with our customers and others to find the most sustainable ways to produce, process and market them,” he said.",2019/9/25 21:30,Collaboration|Ethical Responsibility|Innovation|Agility,Team Collaboration & Communication|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Technology & Process Innovation|Ethical Investment & Responsible Business|Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action|Future Strategy & Foresight,"{""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""positive"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""positive"", ""Technology & Process Innovation"": ""positive"", ""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""positive"", ""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""positive"", ""Future Strategy & Foresight"": ""positive""}",0.95,"{""Team Collaboration & Communication"": ""struck a deal with its biggest Chinese iron ore customer, China Baowu Steel Group, to develop ways to reduce carbon emissions"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""cut emissions"", ""Technology & Process Innovation"": ""develop ways to reduce carbon emissions"", ""Ethical Investment & Responsible Business"": ""to help address the steel industry’s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance"", ""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""to help address the steel industry’s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance"", ""Future Strategy & Foresight"": ""to help address the steel industry’s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance""}",The Guardian

None,Rio Tinto ready to quit Minerals Council if it doesn't support Paris climate targets,Business,64,None,"Rio Tinto has signalled it is prepared to quit its membership of industry associations, including the Minerals Council, if it makes public statements inconsistent with Australia’s Paris climate agreement commitment. The company published a global statement on Thursday night setting out its expectations of the industry bodies it belongs to about commentary they make on climate policy. It includes an expectation that Australian industry associations will publicly argue against government subsidies for coal. The statement comes after more than a year of talks between Rio Tinto and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a not-for-profit group that targets social, environmental and governance issues within large corporations. Related: Rio Tinto gets $2m from emissions reduction fund to switch to diesel For the past two years, its climate work has focused on the influence of lobbying by industry associations, particularly in Australia, on climate policy. It is one of a number of organisations gaining shareholder support to push back on companies over global warming. The centre withdrew a shareholder resolution last month after negotiating the statement with Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto’s statement said it would expect industry associations to make public commentary “consistent with our own public position and the Paris agreement”. Industry bodies would need to take a “technology neutral” approach to public commentary on energy policy and recognise the contribution renewable technologies make to cutting emissions and “not undermine the role they have in the energy mix”. The company also said it would expect associations to support government emissions targets to meet the Paris agreement. The statement has an additional section directed at the Australian groups to which Rio Tinto belongs, which at its last disclosure in 2018 included the Minerals Council of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Queensland Resources Council and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of WA. It said any advocacy by those groups for the use of coal must “note that it will require advanced technology, and in the medium to long term must be consistent with Paris targets”. It was prepared to review its financial contributions and membership of those associations if they failed to meet this standard or its expectation that they would not publicly advocate government subsidies for coal. The executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, Brynn O’Brien, said the announcement signalled a “noticeable deepening” of Rio Tinto’s commitment to align its advocacy through industry associations with its support for the Paris agreement. “We commend Rio Tinto’s revised approach and the willingness they have shown to address lobby groups opposed to progressive action on climate change,” she said. “There are serious rifts emerging between lobby groups which campaign vociferously against climate action, and their members.” The centre has scrutinised political interventions on climate policy by industry lobby groups and had regular meetings with the companies they represent. “We’ve undergone a process at regular intervals of putting evidence of these interventions up in front of the companies and saying to them: Is this in your company’s interests? Is this in your shareholders’ interests?,” O’Brien said. At Rio Tinto’s annual general meeting in London on Wednesday, its chairman, Simon Thompson, pitched a sustainability plan to shareholders. He was asked about the Minerals Council and specifically Coal21, a fund established to invest in low-emissions technologies for the coal industry. “This is an industry association that represents mining companies in Australia of all complexions, including coalmining companies,” Thompson said.” In Australia, it has certainly been quite a controversial issue because a related part of that organisation, called Coal21, has been lobbying for coal, understandably because that’s what their members produce. “The position from Rio Tinto’s point of view is very clear. In all of the industry associations that we are members of we will always advocate in line with the policy statement we put out on climate change.” Guardian Australia sought additional comments from Rio Tinto and from the Minerals Council and the Business Council of Australia. The Minerals Council directed Guardian to a comment from its chief executive, Tania Constable, which is included in the Rio Tinto statement. “For some time now, we have been engaged in discussions with members, including Rio Tinto, on climate-related advocacy and support this latest commitment to partner and advocate for policies that advance climate goals in line with the Paris agreement and keeping a global temperature increase to below 2C,” she said.",2019/4/12 13:55,Ethical Responsibility|Collaboration|Accountability,Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action|Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment|Transparency & Disclosure|Policy & Government Relations|Business & Industry Relations,"{""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""positive"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""positive"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""positive"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""positive"", ""Business & Industry Relations"": ""positive""}",0.87,"{""Environmental Sustainability & Climate Action"": ""Rio Tinto has signalled it is prepared to quit its membership of industry associations, including the Minerals Council, if it makes public statements inconsistent with Australia’s Paris climate agreem"", ""Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment"": ""It is one of a number of organisations gaining shareholder support to push back on companies over global warming."", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""Rio Tinto’s statement said it would expect industry associations to make public commentary “consistent with our own public position and the Paris agreement”."", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""Industry bodies would need to take a “technology neutral” approach to public commentary on energy policy and recognise the contribution renewable technologies make to cutting emissions"", ""Business & Industry Relations"": ""The Minerals Council directed Guardian to a comment from its chief executive, Tania Constable, which is included in the Rio Tinto statement.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto gets $2m from emissions reduction fund to switch to diesel,Environment,64,None,"Australians have paid about $2m from the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund , now rebadged as a “climate solutions” policy, to mining giant Rio Tinto for a diesel-fired power station at a mine in Arnhem Land. The multinational company qualified for climate funding to help pay for the fossil fuel plant at its Gove Peninsula bauxite mine despite the generator being commissioned before the fund opened. It is one of several fossil fuel developments by large companies registered with the fund, which the then prime minister Tony Abbott introduced to pay farmers and businesses to cut greenhouse gases below what they otherwise would have been. Related: Emissions reduction fund to pay for fossil fuel plant that would be built anyway Environmentalists and academics are calling for the scheme to be scrapped or narrowed so it does not support fossil fuel projects and includes a tougher test of whether developments would have gone ahead without public money. National emissions have risen each year since the fund was introduced with an initial $2.55bn four years ago. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Monday the fund would be renamed and receive an extra $2bn over a decade, or $200m a year. Oil to diesel Rio Tinto has received carbon credits and related payments for a 24MW diesel power station built in 2014 after it closed an alumina refinery and heavy fuel oil generator. A 180MW heavy fuel oil station had provided electricity and stream for the refinery, mine and the town of Nhulunbuy and nearby Indigenous communities. The fuel was expensive and contributed to the refinery becoming unviable . Rio Tinto considered replacing it with gas but could not reach an agreement with the Northern Territory government on a supply deal. It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do Tim Baxter, Australian-German Climate and Energy College In December 2014, the company announced it had installed the smaller diesel plant, saying it was “better suited to the needs of our operations and the community”. The plant was registered with the emissions reduction fund 10 months after starting operation and has since sold 188,221 carbon credits to the government through the fund, estimated to be worth about $2m. Projects that receive backing from the fund are required to be new. Asked why Rio Tinto had been allowed to register a diesel plant that was already operating, the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company was required only to give a “notice of intent” before the project started. A Rio Tinto spokesman said it did this in August 2014, more than a year before its registration under the fund was formalised and became public. He said eligibility for carbon credits informed the decision to build the plant, which had resulted in a reduction in emissions of about 215,000 tonnes. Related: Emissions reduction fund could be used to upgrade 40-year-old coal-fired power plant Paul Burke, an economist at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said it was clear from when the emissions reduction fund was introduced that it could lead to “anyway projects” – developments that would have existed regardless – getting public money. He said the fund was better suited to a niche role paying for emissions cuts from activities that could not easily covered by other policies. “This type of subsidy scheme is much more useful for projects such as savannah burning,” he said. “We have much smarter policies available for the electricity sector and large industrial projects.” In the case of Rio Tinto, he said: “A carbon price would have fully given them the incentive to do this project if they needed an additional nudge. It would have been a smarter approach.” Cash from the fund is distributed through reverse auctions, with the cheapest cuts proposed winning contracts. Across eight auctions , $476m has been paid and another $1.8bn contracted, with $226m left unspent. Related: Up in smoke: what did taxpayers get for their $2bn emissions fund? A Guardian Australia investigation last year found it was at best often unclear if the fund was offering value for money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway . Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere . More recently, it revealed Vales Point coal-fired power plant had registered a proposal to upgrade some turbines and South African gold miner Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired power plant it says it would have built anyway. Asked on Monday whether climate funding should help miners pay for gas plants they would have built anyway, the environment minister, Melissa Price, told ABC radio that most of the money had gone to land projects. She said the fund was a good environmental and economic policy. It was part of a $3.5bn suite of climate measures announced by the prime minister, including support for pumped hydro storage, a second Bass Strait electricity cable and promised energy efficiency and electric vehicle programs. Double counting Tim Baxter, an associate with the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, said a further issue with the payments to Rio Tinto is that the site was also covered by the safeguard mechanism , which is meant to ensure industrial facilities do not increase their pollution above business-as-usual levels. Major emitters that breach an agreed baseline are supposed to buy carbon credits to offset the increase. But the mechanism has been criticised as lax for allowing companies to nominate their baselines. Baxter said in the case of companies both covered by the safeguard mechanism and registered under the emissions reduction fund, taxpayers ended up paying polluters to make cuts they were supposed to pay for themselves to meet their baselines. Rio Tinto’s Gove operation fell into this category. “In this situation, the fund is no longer delivering actual carbon reductions,” he said. “It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do.”",2019/2/26 4:00,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability|Execution|Respect|Integrity,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Policy & Government Relations|Operational Efficiency & Performance|Organizational Trust & Inclusion|Legal & Regulatory Integrity,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""negative"", ""Operational Efficiency & Performance"": ""negative"", ""Organizational Trust & Inclusion"": ""negative"", ""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""the fund was offering value for money.

None,Rio Tinto won’t allow UK investors to vote on Mineral Council issue,Business,84,None,"A move urging Rio Tinto to rethink its funding of the fossil fuel lobby has suffered a setback – the Anglo-Australian mining company has refused to present a shareholder motion on the issue to its annual general meeting in the UK. Last week, institutional investors who manage a combined $84bn in funds – and hold about $100m of Rio Tinto shares – filed a motion to the Australian arm of Rio Tinto, calling for a review of the company’s funding of industry association memberships. They said some of those groups lobbied for outcomes that hindered sensible climate and energy policy, and therefore harmed the financial position of the company. Related: Rio Tinto faces $84bn shareholder revolt over membership of Minerals Council The move followed a similar motion filed at BHP , which won a significant minority of votes and resulted in the company announcing it would quit the World Coal Association and reconsider its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia. Like Rio, BHP is dual-listed in the UK and Australia, and it presented the motion to its annual general meetings in both countries. But it has emerged that Rio Tinto will not allow its UK shareholders to vote on the motion. Neither BHP nor Rio were legally obliged to present the motion to their UK AGMs, since they were filed only to the Australian arms of the companies. “That demonstrated BHP is not afraid of hearing from its shareholders on these issues,” said Brynn O’Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which organised the BHP and Rio Tinto motions. She said it was best practice for dual-listed companies to present issues such as these, which related to the global business, to the entire company. By allowing only the Australian arm of the company to vote on the motion, the company appeared to be taking a position against its content, she said. A spokesman for Rio Tinto said the company was working constructively with the co-filers of the motion, and would be happy to continue doing so. “Our willingness to maintain this dialogue, including at the upcoming shareholders meeting in London, is not constrained by the fact that no formal resolution will be considered at the London AGM,” the spokesman said. O’Brien said she understood Rio Tinto had told major investors on a conference call that the motion was related to the Australian business, and so was not relevant to the UK entity. Related: Rio Tinto investors recruited to force mining giant to quit Minerals Council “The attempt to frame this as a local, Australian-specific issue is misguided and inaccurate,” she said. “It is a global issue and there is a concern from shareholders that Rio Tinto does not have any appropriate governance structure in place to make sure the organisations it funds it funds are acting in its financial interests. “What we have in Australia, and also globally, is a government leadership vacuum on climate and energy policy. And that vacuum runs counter to big companies and big energy users. “One of the reasons for that vacuum is the influence of this stratum of fossil fuel lobbies. In Australia that space is occupied by the Minerals Council of Australia, the NSW Minerals Council and the Queensland Resources Council, as well as other industry lobby groups. Those lobby groups are influencing government policy on climate and energy to the point where we have a stalemate.

None,Rio Tinto faces $84bn shareholder revolt over membership of Minerals Council,Business,96,None,"The voice of Australia’s coal lobby is under renewed threat as the country’s second biggest miner, Rio Tinto, faces a shareholder revolt over its membership of lobby groups including the Minerals Council of Australia and the role it plays in Australia’s climate and energy debate. Global investors worth $84bn have joined together to file a shareholder motion calling on Rio Tinto to rethink its membership of the MCA, NSW Minerals Council (NSWMC) and the Queensland Resources Council (QRC). It demands Rio Tinto reveal all membership fees paid since 2012, review the consistency of the MCA’s lobbying positions with those held by Rio Tinto, and disclose what it would take for Rio to quit its membership of the MCA. Related: Rio Tinto investors recruited to force mining giant to quit Minerals Council The action was coordinated by the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country’s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands . If the campaign successfully forces both companies to leave the MCA, it would remove about a third of the MCA’s revenue from membership fees. As such, even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions. When ACCR coordinated a similar motion filed at BHP’s annual general meeting, despite it not winning a vote, BHP agreed to conduct a review of industry associations. That review announced plans to leave the World Coal Association, and declared BHP would quit the MCA if it did not change the way it lobbied for coal. The resolution filed today was submitted by the Australian Local Government Super, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Seventh Swedish National Pension Fund (AP7). Together they have $84bn worth of assets under management, and collectively are thought to hold more than $100m worth of Rio Tinto shares. The resolution is unlikely to gain a majority of votes at the two AGMs held in the UK and Australia (Rio is listed in London and Sydney), but even a significant minority of votes would send a strong signal and could secure a win for ACCR, as it did with BHP. Related: Minerals Council of Australia kicks off coal power campaign despite BHP ?threat Despite BHP already agreeing to many of the demands before the AGM voted on the resolution, and the board recommending shareholders vote against it, about 10% of shareholders voted in favour. Brynn O’Brien, the executive director of ACCR, said that was significant, and anything above 5% was taken very seriously by a board. O’Brien expected more shareholders to support the Rio Tinto motion because it was backed by large institutional investments, unlike the BHP motion, and hoped the board would recommend that shareholders support the motion. “We think this is really in the company’s interest, so the board should support it and recommend that shareolders vote for it,” she said. Such a move would not be unprecedented for Rio Tinto. In 2016, the company was faced with a shareholder motion calling for greater transparency on how it deals with climate risk, and the board supported it , recommending shareholders vote in favour. Bill Hartnett, head of sustainability at Local Government Super, one of the co-filers of the motion, said high energy prices in Australia were a result of the prolonged climate and energy debate here, and that was harming the value of their investment in Rio Tinto. “We estimate that these high electricity prices are adding tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to Rio Tinto’s overall costs,” he said. “The shareholder value in supporting industry groups with contrary energy and climate positions is not clear to LGS, particularly as Rio has exited the thermal coal business in Australia.” Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said Rio’s support of the Paris climate agreement demanded that it not support lobbying that is counter to the agreement’s aims. “For Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company’s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf,” Matthews said. The wording of the resolution is similar to that filed with BHP, and laments climate and energy policy, when it exists in Australia, being “short-lived policy subject to relentless scrutiny and adversarial campaigning by industry bodies”. It also outlines the way the MCA and other pro-coal lobby groups supported by Rio Tinto have campaigned for the destruction of Australia’s carbon tax and mining tax, and pushed for government funding for coal power stations. O’Brien said the shareholder motion is part of a growing and unstoppable movement from investors around the world. “The drumbeat of opposition to coal lobbyists like the Minerals Council of Australia is only growing louder. The interest by European funds in this resolution reflects the fact that Australia’s inaction on climate and energy has impacts beyond our borders,” she said. Dylan Tanner is executive director of InfluenceMap, a UK-based NGO that tracks how corporations influence climate policy around the world. He said his group has seen a rise in interest from investors to improve the role companies in their portfolios play in climate and energy debates. “We have detected a genuine uptick in concern recently and I personally feel 2018 will be the year shareholders get tough on companies who maintain links to egregious lobbyists holding back critical policy progress on a key existential threat to our common future,” he said. The shareholder revolt has come on the same day as the corporate regulator began legal proceedings in the federal court against Rio , its former chief executive Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer Guy Elliott. The proceedings relate to statements in Rio Tinto’s annual report for 2011, which the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges were misleading or deceptive. In December 2010, Rio announced a takeover offer for Riversdale Mining Limited which was completed in August 2011 at a total cost of over US$4bn. Following the acquisition, Rio delisted Riversdale and renamed it Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique. Asic alleges that Rio Tinto engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by misrepresenting the reserves and resources of Riversdale in its 2011 annual report. On 17 January 2013, Rio Tinto announced it expected to recognise a non-cash impairment charge of approximately US$14bn (post-tax) in its 2012 full-year results, including roughly US$3bn relating to Riversdale. It was also announced that Albanese, an American, had stepped down from his role as CEO.",2018/3/2 11:00,Accountability|Agility,Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Risk & Regulatory Management|Reporting & Reputational Risk|Policy & Government Relations|Strategic Defense & Resilience,"{""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Reporting & Reputational Risk"": ""negative"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""negative"", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""Global investors worth $84bn have joined together to file a shareholder motion calling on Rio Tinto to rethink its membership of the MCA, NSW Minerals Council (NSWMC) and the Queensland Resources Coun"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""the Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), which is fresh from successfully forcing the country’s biggest miner, BHP, to agree to similar demands"", ""Reporting & Reputational Risk"": ""even the threat of leaving could force the MCA to shift its lobbying positions"", ""Policy & Government Relations"": ""lobby groups including the Minerals Council of Australia and the role it plays in Australia’s climate and energy debate"", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""Rio Tinto to be part of the solution to climate change requires consistency in all the company’s activities and from the organisations it supports to lobby on its behalf""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto investors recruited to force mining giant to quit Minerals Council,Business,71,None,"Investors in the mining giant Rio Tinto are being recruited to demand the company quit the Minerals Council of Australia. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) has urged shareholders to co-file a resolution at Rio Tinto’s annual general meetings in Australia and the UK in the autumn. The centre successfully filed a similar motion at BHP’s AGMs last year, leading the company to review its membership of trade associations. In that review, published in December , BHP warned the MCA it would quit the body if it did not change its lobbying practices in relation to coal. Related: Minerals Council steps up coal advocacy despite BHP call for neutrality BHP and Rio Tinto are the MCA’s two biggest members. BHP provides the MCA with 17% of its income from membership fees and it is believed Rio Tinto contributes a similar amount. Emerging from a meeting with Rio Tinto executives on Monday, the chief executive of ACCR, Brynn O’Brien, said she had told them the group was preparing its shareholder motion. She said the group needed to find 100 shareholders by the end of the month to move a resolution. She said it would be very similar to the one filed at BHP’s AGMs, which received support from more than 9% of shareholders. That resolution said the Minerals Council had “diminished the federal government’s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations”. “The MCA’s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an ‘effective policy framework’ should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience. “Over time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company’s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.” Related: BHP opposes Minerals Council of Australia's war on activist rights O’Brien said Rio Tinto shareholders might be even more likely to support such a resolution, since the company is based in the UK, where more active shareholder engagement is common. “There’s a greater familiarity of UK investors to the process of shareholder resolutions and more comfort with robust engagement in public with big companies,” O’Brien said. O’Brien said discussions with Rio Tinto were continuing and no decision would be made on filing the resolution until the last minute. She declined to say what Rio could do to avoid the resolution but said simply committing to a review of trade association memberships – as BHP did – would not be enough. “We think the commitment to doing a review doesn’t wholly manage the financial risks they face as a major energy user, or the social and reputational risks they face.”",2018/2/6 4:00,Accountability,Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Risk & Regulatory Management,"{""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""Rio Tinto investors recruited to force mining giant to quit Minerals Council"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""BHP warned the MCA it would quit the body if it did not change its lobbying practices in relation to coal."", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an ‘effective policy framework’""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto changes its designated driver,Business,109,None,"Congratulations, Simon Thompson, current non-executive director of Rio Tinto, you are deemed sufficiently safe to step up to the chairmanship. The world’s second biggest mining company didn’t describe the appointment in this way, of course – but nor did it refer to the extraordinary behind-the-scenes lobbying that killed the hopes of the board’s original preferred candidate, Sir Mick Davis. It was already known that the process had been hijacked by big shareholders, who had written to Rio to say they weren’t keen on Davis, the former boss of Xstrata and the current chairman of the Conservative party. But the blistering tone of the now-leaked letter is worth noting. It is hard to recall a similar instance of a board of a large FTSE 100 company being read the riot act over the appointment of a chairman. Here’s an extract: Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, which represents big fund management groups, said he was relating the views of 13 shareholders representing 20% of the London investor base and wrote on 21 November: “While these long-term shareholders are supportive of the company and its operational strategy, given the challenges facing the organisation, they are of the strong opinion that the individual currently being identified in the media as a potential chairman is not an acceptable candidate. “The clear position of these shareholders would suggest that the company should expect a very hostile audience should it choose to pursue this course of action.” Davis’s business career has always divided opinion. Some fund managers applaud the deal-making that built Xstrata into a $50bn company at the moment he was taken over by Glencore. Others can’t stomach the personal rewards for Xstrata’s top brass, including the ?140m retention package that executives were offered to stay after the takeover. But, remember, Davis had been interviewed and picked by the board of Rio as the frontrunner. A U-turn in these circumstances is unusual. A welcome victory for shareholder power? Up to a point. Almost everybody is in favour of big investors engaging actively with companies and, in this case, there’s a fair argument that Rio doesn’t need a swashbuckling, deal-making chairman at a moment when it is preaching a gospel of disciplined capital allocation. That, as it happens, was this column’s view a few weeks ago. But, in Davis’s shoes, you would also want to know why the Investor Forum mentioned “high personal integrity” as one of three “key investor considerations for this appointment”. That could be read as a general comment. But, in the context of the letter, it could also be taken as personal, nasty and below the belt. Davis, a well-known philanthropist, is entitled to an explanation. Stock market highs are just a sugar rush Another day, another record for Wall Street , and another chance for Donald Trump to spin the shallow idea that his presidency must be successful because stock prices are rising. The notion is shallow because cutting corporate taxes – and thereby delivering an instant boost to companies’ earnings – was always likely to push the stock market higher. The process is almost mechanical, especially for big US-focused companies such as banks and energy companies. But, once the sugar rush fades, expect investors question the long-term economic benefits of cutting corporate taxes. If investors truly believed that the US economy was now set on a course towards higher growth, you would expect a reaction in the market for US government debt. Investors might start to predict higher inflation, for example. But that is not happening. Instead, short-dated and long-dated US Treasury stocks are trading at very similar yields, which traditionally signals economic trouble ahead. Funnily enough, Trump never tweets about that. Workers on boards? How about a non-executive director? Let’s recall, one last time, that ground-breaking pledge made by Theresa May in her brief period as a corporate reformer: “We’re going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but employees as well.” In the latest proposed tweaks to the corporate governance code, there’s no sign of either consumers or workers being installed on the boards of public companies. Taking its cue from the government’s green paper, the Financial Reporting Council says companies can take their pick from one of three options. They can indeed nominate an employee to serve on the board. Or they can create an employee advisory council, if they don’t have one already. Or they can just assign a non-executive director to look out for employees’ interests. This third option is known as kicking the issue into the long grass. It will be popular.",2017/12/5 5:47,Accountability,Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.6,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""It is hard to recall a similar instance of a board of a large FTSE 100 company being read the riot act over the appointment of a chairman.""}",The Guardian
None,Asic could pursue criminal charges against Rio Tinto executives,Business,90,None,"Australia’s corporate regulator has revealed it could pursue criminal charges against Rio Tinto executives after the company failed to promptly tell shareholders about a multi-billion dollar write-down of a coal asset in Mozambique. Related: Rio Tinto charged with fraud in US and fined ?27.4m in UK Greg Medcraft, the chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), was asked a series of questions in Senate estimates on Thursday about Rio Tinto’s disastrous $4bn purchase of Riversdale Mining Company in Mozambique in 2011 . Rio Tinto purchased the company while Tom Albanese was chief executive, and Guy Elliot was chief financial officer. The mining giant has already been fined ?27.4m in the UK after being accused of overstating the value of the coal project. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan, alleging Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliot failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record the African coal asset. The SEC has claimed that within months of the 2011 purchase, Rio’s internal modelling found the value of Riversdale was between negative $3.45bn and negative $9bn, rather than $4bn, and Albanese and Elliot did not immediately tell shareholders about the write-down. It has alleged as the project began to suffer setbacks, resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, Albanese and Elliott sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto’s board of directors, auditors and investors. Medcraft told senators on Thursday that Asic officials had been working with the SEC “from day one” on the case, and it still had a long way to go with the investigation. “We’re not finished yet,” he said. “As I always say it’s a journey; the journey hasn’t finished yet.” The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, an economist who has worked on Wall Street, wanted to know if Asic would bring its own charges against Rio Tinto executives, given that Rio was a dual-listed company in Australia and the UK, and Asic hadn’t launched legal action yet. Medcraft replied: “We could. Correct. Watch this space.” John Price, Asic commissioner, then told senators that Asic’s investigation was “well progressed” and “all enforcement options are on the table.” Guardian Australia understands that to mean that civil and criminal proceedings, against both individuals and the company, could be on the horizon. Medcraft said Asic had had discussions with the SEC about the US regulator taking the lead in the investigation because it had a higher penalty regime and more resources. He said regulators in the UK could also take action against Rio Tinto by administrative decision, without going through the courts, to financially penalise the company. Price said it was also noteworthy that news reports had mentioned the role of a whistleblower in the US, and Asic was keeping an eye on the whistleblower debate in Australia. Medcraft said: “So basically it’s one of those cases, think globally act locally, and try to get the best outcome on an overall basis.”",2017/10/26 14:27,Integrity|Accountability,Legal & Regulatory Integrity|Transparency & Disclosure|Risk & Regulatory Management|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability,"{""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Legal & Regulatory Integrity"": ""Rio Tinto executives after the company failed to promptly tell shareholders about a multi-billion dollar write-down of a coal asset in Mozambique."", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""Albanese and Elliot did not immediately tell shareholders about the write-down."", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""Asic could pursue criminal charges against Rio Tinto executives"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""failed to promptly tell shareholders about a multi-billion dollar write-down""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto charged with fraud in US and fined ?27.4m in UK,Business,105,None,"Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto has been charged with fraud in the US and fined ?27.4m in the UK after being accused of overstating the value of African coal assets. The FTSE 100 company and two of its top former executives were charged in the US of hiding losses by inflating the value of assets in Mozambique, which Rio bought in 2011 for $3.7bn ($2.8bn) and sold a few years later for $50m. America’s financial regulator, the Securities and and Exchange Commission, filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan. It alleges that Rio Tinto, its former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets. As the project began to suffer setbacks, resulting in the rapid decline of the value of the coal assets, Albanese and Elliott sought to hide or delay disclosure of the nature and extent of the adverse developments from Rio Tinto’s board of directors, auditors, and investors, the SEC alleges . “Rio Tinto and its top executives allegedly failed to come clean about an unsuccessful deal that was made under their watch. They tried to save their own careers at the expense of investors by hiding the truth,” said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division. The miner said it intends to “vigorously defend itself” against the allegations. “Rio Tinto believes that the SEC case is unwarranted and that, when all the facts are considered by the court, or if necessary by a jury, the SEC’s claims will be rejected,” the company said in a statement . Shell announced that Elliott was immediately leaving his position as a non-executive director at the Anglo-Dutch oil company as a result of his involvement in the legal case. “We sincerely hope he satisfactorily resolves those proceedings and, that in that event, he would like to be considered for rejoining the board,” said Charles Holliday, Shell’s chairman. Rio Tinto was separately fined ?27.4m by the UK’s financial watchdog for breaching disclosure and transparency rules over its handling of the Mozambique mining assets. It is the largest fine imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority on a company for a breach of rules relating to a firm’s official listing. The Financial Conduct Authority said the fine would have been bigger at ?39.1m but the penalty was reduced because Rio Tinto agreed to settle at an early stage. Rio failed to carry out an impairment test and to recognise an impairment loss on the value of mining assets, which should have been disclosed in 2012 half-year results, the FCA said. “The UK listing regime requires listed companies to adhere to high standards of disclosure and transparency,” said Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. “Rio Tinto should have been aware of its obligation to carry out the impairment test and the resulting material impairment should have been reported to the market at its half year results in 2012.”",2017/10/18 20:04,Integrity|Accountability|Performance,Ethics & Compliance|Transparency & Disclosure|Ethical Compliance & Internal Control|Asset Quality & Management|Risk & Regulatory Management,"{""Ethics & Compliance"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""negative"", ""Asset Quality & Management"": ""negative"", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""negative""}",1,"{""Ethics & Compliance"": ""Rio Tinto, its former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and its former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its "", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets."", ""Ethical Compliance & Internal Control"": ""failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets."", ""Asset Quality & Management"": ""Rio failed to carry out an impairment test and to recognise an impairment loss on the value of mining assets, which should have been disclosed in 2012 half-year results, the FCA said."", ""Risk & Regulatory Management"": ""failed to follow accounting standards and company policies to accurately value and record its assets.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto suspends executive as it investigates Guinea payments,Business,65,None,"Mining group Rio Tinto has suspended a senior executive and alerted US and UK authorities after uncovering $10.5m (?8.4m) of payments to a consultant who worked on its Simandou iron ore project in west Africa . The Anglo-Australian company said it had launched an investigation after discovering in late August emails from 2011 relating to “contractual payments totalling $10.5m made to a consultant providing advisory services on the Simandou project in Guinea”. Alan Davies, the head of Rio Tinto’s energy and minerals division, who was responsible for the Simandou project in 2011, has been suspended “with immediate effect”. Another senior official, legal and regulatory affairs executive Debra Valentine, who was due to leave next May, has stepped down. The group, which has its headquarters in the UK and is listed on the London and New York stock exchanges, has notified authorities in both countries and is in the process of alerting Australian officials. “Rio Tinto intends to cooperate fully with any subsequent inquiries from all of the relevant authorities,” it said. Analysts said the impact on the business should be limited. Shares in Rio Tinto rose more than 2% to ?29.34. RBC Capital Markets analyst Paul Hissey said: “Given the scale of Rio Tinto, it would appear unlikely that this development would have a material impact from a monetary perspective, though we will have to see if anything eventuates from this in the future.” Rio sold its 46.6% stake in the Simandou project to Chinalco for up to $1.3bn last month. It previously had to give up part of the iron ore deposit in Guinea – the world’s largest untapped resource of the steelmaking ingredient – to BSG Resources, a Guernsey-registered company controlled by the Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz. BSG’s multibillion-dollar deal with the Guinean government later became the subject of an international investigation and an agent for BSG received a jail sentence.

None,Scott Morrison criticises West Australian proposal to increase tax on BHP and Rio Tinto,Australia news,108,None,"Scott Morrison has criticised the proposal by the Nationals leader in Western Australia to put a tax of $5 per tonne on iron ore mined by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. Brendon Grylls has been pushing for the tax, saying it would raise an estimated $1.5bn in revenue and help the state’s Coalition government to fix its budget. The WA government delivered a forecast deficit of $3.9bn this year – the worst in the state’s history. Related: Super reforms are good policy. The Coalition’s integrity is at stake if it rejects them | Ian Yates But Morrison dismissed the idea of his state Coalition colleague on Wednesday, telling Perth radio that WA’s economy was not in a good position to handle more taxes. “Increasing taxes is not something that I think helps the economy, particularly when the economy’s weak,” he said. “I don’t really want to get into Western Australian state politics on this issue, other than to say, if you ask me do I think actually increasing taxes on a sector which has gone through a pretty difficult time of late [is a good idea, I’d say] taxing more is not the answer,” he said. Grylls has been pushing for the WA government to increase an already existing – but obscure – tax on BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to fix his state’s budget. BHP and Rio have agreements with the WA government that include a small “production rental fee” of 25c a tonne. The fee has not changed since the 1960s. Grylls wants to increase the rental fee to $5 a tonne. The proposal has been heavily criticised by WA’s Chamber of Minerals and Energy. It said Grylls had failed to mention how many other taxes and royalties miners already paid in WA. The WA government has also been pushing the Turnbull government to rejig the GST formula so Western Australia receives far more revenue than it does currently. The state premier, Colin Barnett, has repeatedly blamed the poor GST allocation for his record budget deficit. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, says he would like to set a percentage floor below which no state’s GST receipts can fall in the future. He has suggested a percentage floor for WA of 75c for every dollar raised, rather than the current 30-odd cents . But that proposal has been slammed by state leaders from New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, and the conservative federal Liberal senator Eric Abetz has also attacked the proposal . This week Barnett weighed into federal politics, saying he opposed holding a marriage equality plebiscite in February 2017 because it would be too close to his state’s election in March.",2016/8/24 13:57,Accountability|Collaboration|Performance|Customer Orientation,Policy & Government Relations|Strategic & Cross-Sector Collaboration|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators|Public Relations & Media Image,"{""Policy & Government Relations"": ""negative"", ""Strategic & Cross-Sector Collaboration"": ""negative"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""positive"", ""Public Relations & Media Image"": ""negative""}",0.92,"{""Policy & Government Relations"": ""Increasing taxes is not something that I think helps the economy, particularly when the economy’s weak"", ""Strategic & Cross-Sector Collaboration"": ""Grylls has been pushing for the tax, saying it would raise an estimated $1.5bn in revenue and help the state’s Coalition government to fix its budget."", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""BHP and Rio have agreements with the WA government that include a small “production rental fee” of 25c a tonne.

None,Town of Bulga vows to not give up fight against Rio Tinto coalmine,Environment,60,None,"A town in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales has vowed to continue fighting the battle against the expansion of a Rio Tinto coalmine. The village of Bulga lost its fight on Friday with the government’s planning and assessment commission, which approved the expansion of Mount Thorley-Warkworth open-cut mine. The planned expansion would bring it to within 2.6km of the town, home to about 350 people, and would prolong the mine’s operations by 20 years. Related: NSW government suggests entire village be relocated for Rio Tinto coalmine John Krey, a Bulga resident, said the decision did not mean the fight was over and the community was exploring legal avenues to overturn the decision. “This could be the beginning of the end for Bulga but we are committed to using civil disobedience, if necessary, to frustrate this expansion, both for Rio Tinto and any future buyer of the mine,” Krey said. The government had worked in the mine’s interests, even changing legislation to enable the approval, he said. The mine was originally approved in 2003 giving “Bulga a buffer zone, guaranteed by ministerial deed of agreement, but this was later taken away by the current government at Rio Tinto’s request”. “Premier Baird’s talk of finding ‘balance’ between communities and mining is cheap when they ignore all advice and common sense to ruin a historic village just to suit a multinational coal company. “If this mine extension goes ahead, 10% of the town will have the option to sell their homes and leave the area, while the rest of us have no option but to stay and suffer the crippling impacts of noise and dust.” The planning assessment commission, which gave conditional approval for the mine in October, said that “serious consideration” should be given to moving the entire town if the expansion went ahead, although the NSW government and Rio Tinto have dismissed the idea. The chief executive of the NSW Nature Conservation Council, Kate Smolski, said the mine expansion approval was a betrayal of Bulga residents and made a mockery of the state’s biodiversity offsets system. Related: Bulga residents battling mine expansion hail NSW government planning decision “Some of the woodlands that will be destroyed include areas Rio Tinto promised to protect in perpetuity to offset the losses caused by the development of the original mine,” she said. The mine expansion would destroy 611ha of native bushland, including three endangered ecological communities, the conservation council said. The mine’s general manager, Mark Rodgers, told the ABC that the approval was good news for the mine’s more than 1,000 workers. “Our workforce, especially before Christmas, have got some positive news and they can get on with managing their lives and focusing on the job and on their safety and it’s a really great outcome,” he said.

None,BP and Rio Tinto face protests over environmental record,Business,80,None,"BP and Rio Tinto, two of the largest companies on the London Stock Exchange, will come under fire on Thursday over their environmental record at their annual meetings. Fishermen, anti-tar sands activists and trade union campaigners all plan to mount noisy demonstrations outside the BP and Rio Tinto annual meetings in London before putting formal questions to the company boards inside the shareholder meetings. Critics of BP argue that livelihoods linked to the fishing industry are still suffering because of continuing problems in the US Gulf following the Deepwater Horizon blowout despite claims by the company of a successful cleanup. On Wednesday, six protesters were arrested at BP’s US headquarters in Houston after breaking into the lobby. Speaking on behalf of the protesters, Cherri Foytlin, a mother of six from the Louisiana Coast, said wildlife was still badly hit by the spill. “Our dolphins and turtles are still dying at unprecedented rates. Our fisheries still struggle to recover. Our hardworking fishing families still suffer economic losses,” she argued. Related: BP dropped green energy projects worth billions to focus on fossil fuels Tar sands campaigners say that BP’s willingness to accept an annual meeting resolution from the Church of England and other large investors on improving its carbon performance is worthless as long as they continue with controversial oil extraction methods in Canada. “BP continues to rush headlong into the tar sands, which is devastating communities, cultures, [and] ecosystems,” said Suzanne Dhaliwal, director of the UK Tar Sands Network. “Extracting the CO 2 contained in the Alberta tar sands projects alone is enough to take the entire planet past the two-degree increase that scientists agree is safe.” Meanwhile the mining group Rio Tinto will be accused of polluting the air and water surrounding their operations from West Papua to Wisconsin by activists from the Unite and the IndustriALL Global Union. Kemal ?zkan, assistant general secretary of IndustriALL, said: “Among the many bad offenders of workers’ rights in the mining industry, Rio Tinto has been picked out for its anti-worker arrogance, as well as its damage to local communities and the environment,” he said. “The company systematically fails on environmental, social and governance factors and our campaign will continue until Rio Tinto becomes the social actor it describes itself to be.” Both BP and Rio can be expected to argue that they take their social and environmental performances very seriously. BP says that a 2014 study by the independent energy consultant IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates found that crude produced from Canada’s oil sands was only 8% more greenhouse gas-intensive than the average crude refined in the US. Rio Tinto says it works closely with all its local communities and stakeholders: “As well as managing the financial and technical risks that our organisation faces, we are committed to managing the sustainable development risks we face at every stage of our businesses’ life cycles.”",2015/4/16 16:39,Ethical Responsibility|Accountability,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative""}",0.9,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""Rio Tinto will be accused of polluting the air and water surrounding their operations from West Papua to Wisconsin"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""BP and Rio Tinto face protests over environmental record"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""Rio Tinto will be accused of polluting the air and water surrounding their operations from West Papua to Wisconsin by activists""}",The Guardian

None,NSW government suggests entire village be relocated for Rio Tinto coalmine,Environment,70,None,"The relocation of the entire village of Bulga due to the expansion of a nearby coalmine should be given “serious consideration”, according to a New South Wales government review. The NSW Planning Assessment Commission, an independent statutory body, recommended on Thursday that Rio Tinto’s controversial Mount Thorley-Warkworth mine extension should go ahead. The PAC’s report , however, found that the expansion would have a “range of adverse impacts” upon the nearby village of Bulga, home to around 350 people. The enlarged mine would come within 3km of Bulga. To mitigate this, the report recommends residents should be compensated if they wish to sell their properties or, more radically, that Bulga be completely moved to an unspecified location to escape the dust and noise of the mine. “Such relocations are undertaken already in dam approvals,” the report states. “Any relocation decision and associated planning would, of course, need to involve the residents of Bulga. “It is recognised that this option is not an approach that would generally be considered, however the commission believes that in this instance there are a unique and unusual set of circumstances that make it worthy of serious consideration.” The report concedes that the relocation idea, which would be funded by taxpayers and Rio Tinto, has not been canvassed with residents during the five years of often bitter debate over the viability of the mine extension. Opponents of the mine have won two court cases, in the Land and Environment court and a supreme court appeal, against the mine’s expansion. Despite this, the approval of the mine development is still under consideration by the NSW government. Paul Harris, a 54 year-old miner who has worked at the Warkworth mine for 30 years while also living in Bulga, said the relocation suggestion is “plain stupidity.” “I think the PAC is really out of touch, this village is a sprawl, I’m not sure how you’d relocate everyone,” he told Guardian Australia. “I’ve been in Bulga all my life, I haven’t bloody blown in for bloody work. We used to use small gear and noise would never be a problem but now we’ve got to endure dust and noise every day for years, apart from Christmas Day and Boxing Day. “I can’t sit out in my back yard and enjoy a beer because of the noise. The dust is a shocker, I can’t filter it out of my pool. Yesterday, we couldn’t even see the hills because of the dust. “If this process gets the green light, we are resigned to moving. I love my place here, I built it to stay here for the next generations but it’s being destroyed. When they blow the rocks up, the ground movement is like living in bloody Christchurch or something.” Harris’s neighbour, 70-year-old local historian Stewart Mitchell, has also lived in Bulga all his life. “The idea of relocating has not been discussed in the past, it has come out of the blue,” Mitchell told Guardian Australia. “They talk about relocating the village but there’s no mention of the neighbouring properties. How do you relocate a 180-acre property? “The first response here was it was some sort of joke. It’s ludicrous that taxpayer money could be used for this. People don’t want to move and it’s been very stressful over the past five years because of the devaluation of properties. “It’s important that the report concedes that we can’t coexist with the mine, though. If it goes ahead, Bulga will be destroyed, as it’ll just be a stone’s throw away.” The expansion of the mine will involve the digging up of a further 230m tonnes of coal over a 21-year period, at a rate of 18m tonnes a year, which would account for 10% of NSW’s total volume of export coal. This enlargement will swallow up an extra 698 hectares, including 459 hectares of endangered ecological habitat. The PAC report states the expansion would safeguard 1,187 jobs over the next 14 years, provide $567m in royalties and there would be “substantial adverse economic impacts” to the towns of Singleton and Cessnock if the project doesn’t go ahead. A Rio Tinto spokesman told Guardian Australia that it would await the NSW government’s response to the report before commenting on the viability of moving Bulga. “We have followed due process at all times,” the spokesman said. “We are committed to working with the people of Bulga and believe the village has a strong future.” Rio Tinto said there were more than 2,000 submissions from locals and businesses in favour of the mine extension and pointed out that it would provide more than 1,800 hectares of land towards a national park in the Upper Hunter region as part of biodiversity “offsets”. A spokesman for the NSW department of planning and environment said: “The department of planning and environment will consider the PAC’s review as its assessment is finalised. “Once the final assessment is complete, the independent PAC will make the final determination.”",2015/3/6 13:57,Ethical Responsibility|Performance|Respect|Accountability|Well-being,Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Business Impact & Operational Outcomes|Employment Opportunities & Job Roles|Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability|Transparency & Disclosure|Food & Lifestyle Well-being|Asset Quality & Management,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""positive"", ""Employment Opportunities & Job Roles"": ""positive"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative"", ""Food & Lifestyle Well-being"": ""negative"", ""Asset Quality & Management"": ""positive""}",0.78,"{""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""the expansion would have a “range of adverse impacts” upon the nearby village of Bulga"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""provide $567m in royalties"", ""Employment Opportunities & Job Roles"": ""safeguard 1,187 jobs over the next 14 years"", ""Stakeholder & Shareholder Accountability"": ""Opponents of the mine have won two court cases"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""the relocation suggestion is “plain stupidity.”"", ""Food & Lifestyle Well-being"": ""I can’t sit out in my back yard and enjoy a beer because of the noise."", ""Asset Quality & Management"": ""devaluation of properties""}",The Guardian
None,"FTSE moves higher on Greek, Ukraine hopes and Rio Tinto boost",Business,92,None,"Despite deadlock in Wednesday’s talks between Greece and the rest of the eurozone, leading shares are edging higher again. Investors are hoping that even though there was not even an agreement on issuing a statement, let alone any sign of deal, that the two sides will be able to reach a compromise before Greece’s money runs out. Talk of a cease fire between Russia and Ukraine after prolonged peace talks is also helping sentiment. And even though mining shares have been volatile as metal prices suffered on demand concerns, Rio Tinto has given a lift to the sector. Its shares have jumped 90.5p to ?30.62 - making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - after it decided to hand back $2bn to shareholders on top of a bigger than expected dividend. The move came despite its worst half year profit in two years, with earnings down 30% at $4.19bn. But this was higher than analyst expectations of around $3.76bn, and it cut debt to $12.5bn, again better than forecast. The company, which could yet face a renewed takeover attempt from Glencore, also said 125m tonnes of iron ore capacity came out of the market in 2014 and it expects another 80m tonnes in the current year. Numis said: The low-cost/volume-push strategy appears to be working for Rio, marginal producers will continue to be pushed out of the arena, whilst Rio maintains decent margins, albeit not bull market margins. Rio see margins for low-cost producers returning to just above the average level seen before the China driven commodity boom. The buy-back is at the higher end of market expectations. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 23.30 points at 6841.47, although energy groups are proving a drag on the market. Royal Dutch Shell B shares are down 26p at 2218.5p after they went ex-dividend, while BP is 3.35p lower at 442.45p for the same reason. But Burberry is 38p better at ?18.59 after RBC began coverage with an outperform rating. It said: Digital leadership, beauty expansion, and high US exposure should sustain Burberry’s top-line outperformance in 2015 and beyond. We believe Burberry deserves a higher PE valuation premium to luxury peers thanks to its stronger top- and bottom-line growth potential, superior return on invested capital and attractive cash return outlook.

None,Rio Tinto rises on rejected Glencore approach,Business,90,None,"Shares in Rio Tinto raced ahead more than 5% in London on Tuesday after the miner rejected a merger approach from smaller rival Glencore. A tie-up between the two would create the world’s biggest mining group, ahead of BHP Billiton, and valued at ?100bn. Rio shares jumped 5.5% to ?31.57 in early trading, adding ?3.1bn to the company’s market value. Other miners also gained ground – Anglo American was up 3% at ?13.82, Antofogasta added 1.1% to 714.5p, Fresnillo rose 1.3% to 755p, BHP gained nearly 1% to ?16.93 and Randgold Resources rose 0.7% to 41.84p. Glencore edged down before trading marginally higher at 339.85p, a 0.2% gain. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Rio reiterated that no talks were taking place with Glencore, which made its approach on a potential merger in July. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Glencore had approached its largest shareholder, Chinese state-owned Aluminium Corp of China (Chinalco), to sound out its interest in a potential deal “in recent weeks”. Chinalco owns 9.8% of Rio. “The Rio Tinto board, after consultation with its financial and legal advisers, concluded unanimously that a combination was not in the best interests of Rio Tinto’s shareholders,” the company said, echoing a statement made to the Australian stock exchange on Monday. “The board’s rejection was communicated to Glencore in early August and there has been no further contact between the companies on this matter.” The price of iron ore, Rio’s most profitable product, fell towards a five-year low at the time. Iron ore would fill a gap in Glencore’s portfolio of commodities. RBC Capital Markets analyst Timothy Huff said: “A potential merger with Rio would enable Glencore to get hold of the lowest-cost iron ore business in Australia. This is likely just a shot across the bow from Glencore and we expect Glencore to play the long game with any highly desired acquisition target. While asset divestments may have to play a larger part in a Glencore/Rio tie-up, we think the broader strategy for an enlarged group makes sense.” Glencore’s boss, Ivan Glasenberg, is thought to be keen on more acquisitions, after last year’s controversial purchase of Xstrata, the biggest deal in the sector. Huff thinks any regulatory hurdles could be overcome. “Any antitrust hurdles will likely be limited to copper and thermal coal. As Glencore demonstrated with the Xstrata acquisition, it should be able to overcome any antitrust issues via divestitures of select assets.” Analysts at Bernstein wrote last month: “A Rio Tinto-Glencore combination would create market-leading positions in iron ore, copper, nickel, zinc and coal as well as significant optionality around a number of lesser metals and minerals. Moreover, it would create the biggest and most diversified mining company on the planet.”",2014/10/7 22:25,Agility|Performance,Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)|Market Performance & Competitiveness|Strategic Defense & Resilience|Shareholder & Investor Returns|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators,"{""Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)"": ""positive"", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""positive"", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""positive"", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""positive"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""negative""}",0.89,"{""Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)"": ""A tie-up between the two would create the world’s biggest mining group, ahead of BHP Billiton, and valued at ?100bn."", ""Market Performance & Competitiveness"": ""Rio shares jumped 5.5% to ?31.57 in early trading, adding ?3.1bn to the company’s market value."", ""Strategic Defense & Resilience"": ""A potential merger with Rio would enable Glencore to get hold of the lowest-cost iron ore business in Australia."", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""The board’s rejection was communicated to Glencore in early August and there has been no further contact between the companies on this matter."", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""The price of iron ore, Rio’s most profitable product, fell towards a five-year low at the time.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto looks out of Glencore’s reach,Business,106,None,"It’s the mega-merger rumour that won’t go away: Glencore is getting ready to make a bid for Rio Tinto. The latest airing, from Bloomberg, contained the detail that Chinalco of China, which owns almost 10% of Rio, is being sounded out to support the creation of a $160bn (?100bn) mining monster. Rio’s New York-traded stock briefly rose nearly 20%. Glencore’s Ivan Glasenberg, billionaire kingpin and 8% owner of the company, has an unquenchable appetite for owning and trading assets, so the heart of the tale is easy to believe. It’s hard, though, to understand why Rio’s shareholders would be tempted by any price that Glencore could afford to offer. Rio has had accidents aplenty in the past – from the hubristic $38bn top-of-the-market purchase of Alcan in 2007 to the comic failure to gain permits to ship coal along the Zambezi in Mozambique. But these days Rio investors know roughly what they own: a low-cost producer of iron ore in Australia with a sideline in copper in Mongolia. Iron ore prices are currently plunging but, if investors don’t like Rio’s reliance on serving Chinese steelmakers, other miners’ shares are available. Why would they wish to swap their Rio shares for Glencore stock, except on terms that Glasenberg would never offer? Glencore, in case anybody has forgotten, has been a shocking performer as a public company. It was floated at 530p in 2011 but the shares fetch 340p today. Where is the appeal for Rio meant to lie? Tesco’s new hire Richard Cousins of Compass Group, on the face of it, is a good hire for Tesco as a non-executive director . He is a successful chief executive; he has crisis-fighting experience as his first task at Compass, in 2006, was to resolve a messy scandal involving a UN contract; and Compass, as a contract caterer, could be viewed as being in the retail game, broadly speaking. But there’s a problem: does Cousins have enough free hours to get his hands dirty at Tesco? One would have assumed not, because lack of time was the reason Cousins gave for quitting the Reckitt Benckiser board in May. Reckitt’s statement from last December was frank on why Cousins would leave: “Richard is assuming an increasingly day-to-day operational role as CEO of Compass Group, which he has concluded will impact on his ability to devote sufficient time to his role as a non-executive director of Reckitt Benckiser.” No room for misunderstanding there: Cousins felt he needed to concentrate on his day job, an understandable stance as it is Compass that pays his wages. Five months after leaving Reckitt, however, Cousins suddenly has time to put in a shift at Tesco. How? Neither Tesco’s nor Compass’s statements explained. Compass shareholders, you would think, will want to push chairman Paul Walsh. Was Cousins using the “not enough hours in the day” plea as a polite excuse to exit Reckitt? Or has his “day-to-day operational role” at Compass changed yet again? Reckitt was a gentle posting as the Dettol to Durex group tends to run on rails. Today’s Tesco is a very different prospect. Sir Richard Broadbent, chairman, is relying on Cousins, plus Mikael Ohlsson from Ikea, to repair the board’s deficit in retailing experience. Of course, even an overstretched non-executive worth his salt could have told Broadbent that running four corporate jets, then ordering a fifth, is inviting trouble. But the job is meant to be more demanding than that. If Cousins found the Reckitt post too time-consuming, what is he doing at Tesco? Bramson’s mistake Edward Bramson, the activist investor, got what he deserved yesterday in an attempt to storm the boardroom of Electra Private Equity: a thumbs-down from other shareholders. Four-fifths of their votes were cast against his election. In the end, the outcome wasn’t even close. Bramson’s Sherborne Investors, despite owning a 20% stake, could only get to 38%. Bramson’s mistake was to claim there was “at least” ?1bn of extra value to be released from Electra but fail to explain how he could, in effect, double the share price within a couple of years. “He had no insights, no thoughts, no opinions, no plans – nothing whatsoever,” said the representative from Investec Asset Management at the meeting. Quite. If Bramson really thought there was a spare ?1bn waiting to be scooped up, he should have tried to summon a few financial backers to support a full bid. Instead, he created the impression that his efforts were an attempt to gain creeping control of Electra. This was a resounding defeat but Bramson is not the type to slink away. Perhaps he will attempt a full takeover. If not, the whole adventure looks an enormous waste of time and energy.",2014/10/7 6:12,Agility|Performance|Accountability,Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)|Shareholder & Investor Returns|Business Impact & Operational Outcomes|Strategic Planning & Direction|Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators|Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)"": ""positive"", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""negative"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""negative"", ""Strategic Planning & Direction"": ""positive"", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.75,"{""Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)"": ""Glasenberg, billionaire kingpin and 8% owner of the company, has an unquenchable appetite for owning and trading assets"", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""Rio’s New York-traded stock briefly rose nearly 20%."", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""Rio has had accidents aplenty in the past – from the hubristic $38bn top-of-the-market purchase of Alcan in 2007 to the comic failure to gain permits to ship coal along the Zambezi in Mozambique."", ""Strategic Planning & Direction"": ""these days Rio investors know roughly what they own: a low-cost producer of iron ore in Australia with a sideline in copper in Mongolia."", ""Market Dynamics & Financial Indicators"": ""Iron ore prices are currently plunging"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""Sir Richard Broadbent, chairman, is relying on Cousins, plus Mikael Ohlsson from Ikea, to repair the board’s deficit in retailing experience.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto shares rally on rumours of Glencore takeover bid,Business,86,None,"Shares in Rio Tinto jumped in New York on Monday after a report that it could face a takeover bid from rival Glencore to create a ?100bn mining giant. The US-listed shares of Rio initially rose nearly 20% after Bloomberg reported that Glencore had approached the largest shareholder in Rio to gauge the appetite for a deal. Tie-ups between companies in the mining sector are often the subject of speculation, and rumours about a marriage between Rio and Glencore have swirled of late. Both companies have primary listings in London; a deal between the two would make the enlarged company the biggest stock market listed mining group in the world, overtaking BHP Billiton. Glencore is said by Bloomberg to have approached Chinalco, the Chinese company which has a 10% stake in Rio, about the possibility of an offer. Bloomberg reported that no formal offer had been made. Shares in London, where Glencore and Rio have their main stock market listing, had closed for trading when the report first appeared. Rio’s US shares fell after the initial euphoria to be 7% higher in afternoon trading. Neither company would comment, but analysts at Bernstein published research last month exploring the options for Glencore, a company it argued was focused on conducting more acquisitions under its ambitious boss Ivan Glasenberg. It controversially bought Xstrata last year. Bernstein analysts wrote last month: “A Rio Tinto-Glencore combination would create market-leading positions in iron ore, copper, nickel, zinc and coal as well as significant optionality around a number of lesser metals and minerals.

None,Boom and dust: uncertain future for the mining town run by Rio Tinto,World news,90,None,"Dixon Peters, a 28-year-old Yolngu man from the remote community of Gapuwiyak, jabs his boot into Northern Territory red dirt at the mention of Rio Tinto. Peters works odd jobs as part of an NT employment program. Some days he mows lawns, other days he’ll do a spot of welding. He wants to train as a mechanic, but there are no suitable programs in the area. What he doesn’t want to do, he says, is work in the local mine. “Rio Tinto has come in, destroyed our land and given us money for it,” he says. “I don’t want them coming in and digging everything up, destroying nature. They are affecting our water and killing all the fish. I think the country is more important than that.” Peters’ home of Gapuwiyak is one of the small missionary-founded communities here, small specks dotted on the gargantuan tapestry of incandescent rocks, rivers and forests that make up Arnhem Land , an area larger than Portugal but with a population a little over 16,000. This is Yolngu land , they’ve been living on it for more than 40,000 years. But here on the Gove peninsula, this is also a land shaped by mining, most recently since behemoth Rio Tinto bought into the area in 2007. The Yolngu fought to stop the establishment of the bauxite mine and the associated alumina refinery – set up in 1963 by Nabalco, which was later renamed Alcan Gove and bought by Rio Tinto. Famously, bark petitions from the Yolngu of Yirrkala were delivered to parliament, where they now hang. The totemic case, the first documented recognition of Indigenous people in Australian law, was an opening salvo in the ultimately successful push for land rights. But the court ruled against the Yolngu on the matter of the mine, and in 1963 the mine came, and an entire town – Nhulunbuy – was built to service it. Since then a 22,000-hectare principality has been carved out – an area larger than Washington DC – in Yolngu land. Rio Tinto effectively runs Nhulunbuy, which sits on the same excised area as the bauxite mine, a hulking structure that shuttles 8.2m tonnes of rust-red dirt a year to the refinery via a snaking 20km conveyor belt. And now, despite their early opposition, many Yolngu have come to depend on Rio Tinto, or rather what flows from it. This is why Rio Tinto’s decision to close its Gove refinery has sent shockwaves through the area. While the refinery didn’t employ many Yolngu, it was the raison d’etre for vital services in the area, from the hospital to the electricity to the food that is shipped into the Rio Tinto-owned port. The refinery closed in July; 1,100 workers were made redundant. People now worry about what Rio Tinto could still take away, because Nhulunbuy is a company town in almost everything but name. The power station, the port facilities, the warehouses, the fuel storage facilities and the airport all sit on Rio Tinto’s lease. Vast chunks of infrastructure could potentially depart; there are concerns the supermarket and bank could follow suit, despite assurances to the contrary. People are worried the hospital could be in danger. The NT government says cryptically it will assess what the “impact of Rio’s decision is on the future health demands of Nhulunbuy and the east Arnhem region”. “If they take things away from us, we’ll have no money,” says Peters. “I’m worried about everything going. I’m worried that they will take the principal away from our local school. He grew up here.” It wasn’t meant to be like this. Just three years ago, Rio Tinto promised “long-term intergenerational benefits” from an agreement struck with Gumatj elder Galarrwuy Yunupingu and senior Rirratjingu figure Bakamumu Marika, representing the two key Yolngu clans. It was the first agreement of its kind signed between traditional owners and a mining company – “Rio found its conscience”, as a negotiator for the clans recalls it. For the previous 40 years, the federal government had compensated the Yolngu for having their land forcibly removed and then ripped apart by metallic teeth and arms. Payments amounted to $3m in 2010. By contrast, the handsome new deal was to provide between $15m and $18m a year, depending on the price of bauxite, until 2053. The money was paid to funds run by the Gumatj and the Rirratjingu to fund medical, retail and residential developments, as well as forge employment opportunities. But almost immediately the difficulties hit. The mining boom unhelpfully forced up the Australian dollar. The bauxite price then dipped and the NT government reneged on a deal to fund an epic 1,000km gas pipeline from Katherine to Gove to power the refinery, citing a $3bn risk to taxpayers. Rio Tinto insists the agreement with the Yolngu remains in place after the refinery closure, although the confidentiality of the deal’s details mean it is unclear whether the payments will continue as before. All of this has left the communities here confused about what the future holds. Effects of the exodus Nhulunbuy is a slightly surreal place, a piece of white real estate in black Australia. Neatly trimmed, verdant front lawns sit beside boat trailers in the driveways. Parents usher their floppy hat-wearing children in and out of a neat primary school, while a few Rio Tinto workers mill about their rather spartan company accommodation camp in the centre of town. The town’s population of 4,000 will slump by as much as half when all the Rio Tinto workers and their families leave, with most set to depart by January. The effects of the exodus are already being felt. Qantas, which is to cease its regional flights to and from Nhulunbuy’s airport, has put up its company-owned houses for sale. A fabric shop open for the past decade will be shutting. “It seems like the right time to go,” the owner says. A few houses lie empty. More will follow. Locals talk about a family spending $700,000 on a house that is suddenly worth $250,000. Meanwhile Rio Tinto has committed 250 of its now-dormant properties to a project that aims to bring in new residents – namely, Yolngu people. If the town is to survive, it will be in an altered state, both economically and socially. “Everything here is hooked up for Rio Tinto: the power, water, everything,” says a resident who has lived in the town for several decades. “They say the power station will stay but I saw them bring in diesel generators a couple of days ago. There’s a complete lack of information from the company.” The resident fears the change to come. “If the Yolngu people come in, it will change things a lot around here. It’s 99% white at the moment … we’ll see the crime rate go through the roof, it’ll be like Alice Springs or Tennant Creek here.” Racial divisions, and tensions, are hard to ignore here. Practically no Indigenous people worked at the Gove refinery, yet the Yolngu people have been on the receiving end of the benefits – infrastructure, and payments to the two main clan groups – and the ignominies – the alcohol dependency, the suicide – that have come with the mine, both directly and indirectly. The Yolngu didn’t want alcohol to be on sale in Nhulunbuy, but it is. Now parts of the beach at nearby Yirrkala, a Yolngu-dominated township where alcohol is banned, have a shimmering blanket of used Victoria Bitter cans. Charting a future Klaus Helms is a stout balanda, or non-Indigenous person, with a shock of white hair. Having worked alongside Yolngu people since his arrival on the Gove peninsula in 1969, Helms is now the chief executive of the Gumatj Corporation. “If Nhulunbuy is to survive, they will need about a 30% increase in Yolngu people in the town,” he says. “Some people will be very uncomfortable with that change. But you know what, it’s called tough luck. It’s Indigenous land.” The clan that put its trust in Helms call him “detun”, or buffalo, due to his frequent, gruff collisions with Rio Tinto and its predecessors in the area. His job is to help plot a future for the Gumatj. “We need to hold on to as much infrastructure as possible and we need to think about what we need to do to survive,” he says. “I say the word survive, not thrive. If we’re not careful we’ll lose what’s left. It’s OK for Rio Tinto workers – they’ve got a big payout and they’ve left. We’re still here.” While Helms wants to ensure essentials such as electricity remain, he sees an opportunity to diversify into new areas, albeit still primary industries – forestry on Rio Tinto’s rehabilitated mine area, development of pockets of gas and manganese. The Gumatj Corporation has an exploration licence for its own bauxite project, in a bid to wrest greater autonomy over the benefits of mining for local people. A $2.5m mining training centre , funded by Rio Tinto, will take on about 30 Yolngu to improve their skills. About 20 are already involved in the existing bauxite mine. “What kind of deal can you do for a mine on your land if you don’t know anything about mining?” Helms says. “If you don’t know anything, you leave the deal to other people and that’s what we need to cut out – those middle people.” Both the NT government and Rio Tinto have said they will not abandon the people left in Nhulunbuy. Rio Tinto says it will be increasing its bauxite mining, as well as ensuring vital services stay online and offering fresh investment into an economic development project to create new jobs. In a speech at the annual Garma festival, Phil Edmands, managing director of Rio Tinto Australia, said the closure of the refinery was a “difficult but necessary” decision. “Rio Tinto remains committed to working in partnership with the traditional owners, businesses, governments and community organisations to help provide opportunities for Yolngu people in this region,” Edmands said. Meanwhile, the NT government is continuing to talk up the prospects for north-east Arnhem Land, citing oil and gas exploration but also new opportunities, such as tourism . “The local community has shown that it’s resilient and adaptable,” a government spokeswoman said. “People in the region have worked together to support one another and that is expected to continue.” With about 90% of the NT covered by mining exploration licences, however, it is clear lessons need to be learned quickly if Indigenous people are to reap the long-term benefits they’ve been repeatedly promised. Joe Morrison, the chief executive of the Northern Land Council , says: “A lot of other Aboriginal people around the country will have to deal with what happens when a mining company leaves.” “We’ve seen the boom and bust that mining brings. Some people have done well, some have been marginalised and some have really struggled. In many places, during the mining boom Aboriginal people were left rotting in the streets. “You can’t see mining as a panacea for Aboriginal ills when you look at the high rates of suicide and self-harm, for example. There are big, big social problems. It also brings pressure for people to live in two worlds – their Aboriginal culture and also the aspirations of the balanda.” Australia’s grand experiment of handing dominion of remote towns to mining companies has social, as well as economic, implications. Ambitious visions during the boom years can lead to confusion and, sometimes, despair when the slump arrives. “The problem is that there is no plan to wind things down when the boom is over,” Morrison says. “I’ve got serious concern that there is no plan for Gove. “The Aboriginal people haven’t gone anywhere for thousands of years. It’s the mining that came and went and the Aboriginal people are the ones left with the question of ‘what now?’ ” There remains the possibility of a smart, diverse economy for Indigenous people, rather than simply tearing asunder the vast red dirt of the NT for minerals. “There are things like tourism and cottage industries selling bush products such as soap,” Morrison suggests. “These kinds of things intersect with cultural knowledge and they involve women and children, which isn’t the case with mining. We need to think about our language and our customs as an advantage.” Another legacy left by the refinery is an environmental one. Conservationists fret over whether contaminated wetlands can be returned to a semi-natural state, as well as the risk of a dangerous spill of the caustic soda used by the plant. A Rio Tinto spokesman stresses that full-time staff will continue to monitor the ponds of toxic waste, with environmental management still a “key priority” for its operations. But Dr Stuart Blanch , an NT environmental lawyer, says bauxite operations rarely leave behind a landscape that can be rehabilitated. “The Gove refinery has ponds of toxic material and if that was released into the sea, from a flood or cyclone, that would be really bad news,” he says. “The real concern would be the marine environment, as the area is a relatively pristine one for sea turtles, dugongs and three species of endemic coastal dolphin. “We want the refinery shut down and the toxins taken away, rather than it sitting there like an eyesore in the hope it may reopen.” Peters, the young mower-cum-welder from Gapuwiyak, would indeed like to escape the tentacles of mining. But, for now, there is little opportunity to be fussy. When I tell him of the new Rio Tinto/Gumatj mining training centre, he leans forward, his eyes wide. Instinctive hostility to digging up this storied, tropical terrain collides with expediency. “What? They will train people there?” he asks. “Train Indigenous people, like me?”",2014/8/11 15:07,Ethical Responsibility|Performance|Execution|Agility|Learning,Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights|Business Impact & Operational Outcomes|Infrastructure & Maintenance|Future Strategy & Foresight|Learning & Development,"{""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Cultural Heritage & Indigenous Rights"": ""positive"", ""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""negative"", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""negative"", ""Future Strategy & Foresight"": ""positive"", ""Learning & Development"": ""positive""}",0.76,"{""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""Boom and dust: uncertain future for the mining town run by Rio Tinto"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""destroyed our land and given us money for it,” he says. “I don’t want them coming in and digging everything up, destroying nature.

None,Rio Tinto sues Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz,Business,100,None,"The Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto is suing Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz, accusing him of stealing one of the world's largest untapped iron ore reserves with a scheme that breached US laws against organised crime. In the latest twist in the legal saga surrounding the ore reserves in Guinea, Rio Tinto has brought a claim in New York alleging that Steinmetz, his company BSG Resources (BSGR), and the Brazilian mining corporation Vale were guilty of ""the theft of Rio Tinto's valuable mining rights … through a scheme in violation of the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organisations Act"". The move comes three weeks after the government of Guinea announced it would strip Guernsey-registered BSGR of the concession because the company had obtained them through corruption. The concession was taken from Rio Tinto in 2008 and subsequently handed to BSGR, with the company saying it had secured the deal through a $165m (?98.5m) investment in the exploration of the area. BSGR then sold 51% of its prize to Vale for $2.5bn. However, Guinea says it now has ""precise and coherent evidence"" that BSGR used intermediaries to pay bribes to Mamadie Touré, the wife of Lansana Conté, the ruler until his death in 2008. Much of the evidence was gathered in the US by the FBI during an inquiry into the activities of Frederic Cilins, an associate of Steinmetz, and handed over to the government of Guinea. Cilins was arrested in Florida last year after the FBI recorded a series of meetings with Touré, and faces four years in prison after pleading guilty earlier this year to obstructing a criminal investigation. Unbeknown to Cilins, Touré was co-operating with investigators, who recorded their conversations. In a statement, Rio Tinto said it was asking the courts in New York ""to award compensatory, consequential, exemplary and punitive damages … in an amount to be determined at trial"". Steinmetz and BSGR deny any wrongdoing and say they will seek international arbitration against Guinea's government. Ian Middleton, a former British army officer who acts as a spokesman for Steinmetz and his company, said: ""Rio Tinto chose to do nothing with its mining rights so the mining rights were taken away. Baseless and bizarre lawsuits like this won't change that fact."" Middleton has refused to comment on the FBI recordings. Vale chief executive Murilo Ferreira said that no government had accused it of wrongdoing and challenged Rio Tinto to produce evidence against his company. The government of Guinea says Vale is welcome to bid for new mining contracts. Meanwhile, the Swiss newspaper Le Temps has reported that Vale is launching a $1.1bn claim against BSGR.

None,Rio Tinto heavily blamed by protesters over 41 mine worker deaths,Business,106,None,"Protesters and unions from around the world heavily criticise mining company Rio Tinto on Tuesday over alleged lapses in safety leading to the deaths of 41 people and a string of claimed environmental abuses. Global trade union IndustriAll, which represents 50 million industrial workers across the world, accused Rio of ""very wide breaches of fundamental rights"" and said the Anglo-Australian mining company could have done more to prevent the 41 deaths last year. Kemal ?zkan, assistant general secretary of IndustriAll, said the deaths of 33 gold miners when a tunnel collapsed at a Rio joint venture mine in Indonesia last May could have been avoided. He claimed that the Indonesian human rights commission found that the operators of the Grasberg mine, owned with US company Freeport, ""had the ability to prevent this from happening but didn't"". ""The lack of effort jeopardised the lives of others. The gravity of this case is serious,"" he quoted Indonesian human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai as saying in a report into the incident. Jan du Plessis, Rio's chairman, described the Indonesian deaths as a ""tragedy"" and said the company was doing all it could to improve safety. ""We've got to be [by far] one of the leaders in this field [safety],"" he said at the company's annual meeting in London. He admitted that the Grasberg mine, the world's largest gold mine, was ""far from perfection"". But said Rio's board believed both safety and environmental issues would not be improved by the company pulling out of the operation in Papua. Well-known private shareholder John Farmer said it was unacceptable for the company to ""gloss over 33 deaths just because it [the mine] is managed by someone else"". A company spokesman later said: ""Rio Tinto does not manage the Grasberg operation, but we do not stand aside when fatalities occur. We are working with Freeport, the managers of the mine on safety, as well as community, human rights and other issues."" Native Papuan people protesting against the Grasberg mine, which has also been at the centre of alleged environmental abuses, were joined by others complaining about alleged human right and environmental abuses in Madagascar, Australia, Namibia and the US. Perle Zafinandro, the leader of a community protest group against Rio's majority-owned coastal forest mine in Madagascar, accused the company of ""land grabbing and environmental devastation"". Sam Walsh, Rio's chief executive, apologised for poor communication and promised better engagement with local people. He said the level of compensation for people displaced by the QIT Madagascar Minerals mine was negoitated by the Madagscar government, which owns 20% of the mine, not Rio. Walsh also committed to ""turning the area back to what it was"" and has employed a ""team running a [plant] nursery to be able to fully rehabitualise the area"". Zafiandro said: ""How are you going to get these trees to grow on the dead sands left behind?""

None,Documents reveal extent of Shell and Rio Tinto lobbying in human rights case,Business,100,None,"The extent of lobbying conducted by Shell and Rio Tinto in seeking legal support from the UK government to dismiss allegations of human rights abuses has been revealed in internal memorandums released by the Foreign Office (pdf) . The documents, obtained by the Corporate Responsibility Coalition (Core) and Amnesty International, show the closeness of the relationship between the multinational corporations and UK government departments. They also show that UK government officials were privately worried about being seen to be promoting business interests over ethical trading principles. More than 60 pages of documents and letters from 2011 and 2012 have been obtained through freedom of information requests. The documents relate to two high-profile court cases against the firms at the US supreme court over alleged complicity in mistreatment of protesters and people who lived near extraction operations. The lead case, Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum Company , related to the fate of anti-Shell protesters in the Ogoni region of Nigeria who were executed by Nigeria's military junta in 1995. The second case was brought by environmental activists under the US's Alien Tort Statute against Rio Tinto, claiming that residents in Bougainville, an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea, suffered from pollution linked to the company's copper and gold mine. The US Alien Tort Statute dates back to 1789 but had been used to pursue claims over violations of international law. In a landmark judgment last year, the US supreme court limited the law's reach by declaring that it cannot be used to sue foreign organisations for supposed wrongdoing on foreign soil. The cases against Rio Tinto and Shell were consequently dismissed. In the runup to the hearings in Washington, Shell and Rio Tinto approached the Foreign Office and other ministries in London seeking UK government backing. The FCO initially intervened at the US supreme court with a legal brief supporting Shell, pointing out the damage to British business of ""extraterritorial jurisdiction"". The FCO documents say the submission ""was not at the behest of Shell"". The FCO then added a second, neutral brief – against Shell's wishes – making similar points of law. One memorandum states: ""While our argument in this case is a matter of sound legal principle, the perception of critics of HMG's position on business and human rights will be that we are standing up for big business and against the human rights cause of ordinary people."" Marilyn Croser, of Core, said: ""While paying lip-service to corporate responsibility, the government was conniving with multinationals to reduce their exposure to litigation for the worst kind of abuses."" Peter Frankental, economic relations programme director at Amnesty International UK, said: ""In these David versus Goliath encounters, the UK has effectively shielded the interests of powerful companie s at the expense of their alleged victims."" Responding to the claims, the FCO said: ""The UK intervened in this case to clarify our position on the proper limits of the extraterritorial application of US law. The UK initially submitted a brief in support of Shell because we were not advised that a neutral brief was a possibility. As soon as we became aware, we replaced our original brief with a neutral brief, as the best way of representing our wider legal concerns without taking a position on the specific allegations in this case."" A Shell spokesman said: ""Shell companies have the right and the responsibility to make our position known to governments on any matters which affect us, our employees, our customers, our shareholders or local communities in a manner which is in accordance with our values and business principles. We have always denied, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in the Kiobel case.""

None,Rio Tinto chief urges carbon capture progress despite research funding halt,Business,84,None,"A Rio Tinto executive has claimed it is “fruitless to keep indulging in idealistic discussions about climate change” because fossil fuels are “here to stay” and has demanded more investment in carbon capture and storage. But the company, along with other Australian coal producers, has stopped payments to the industry’s much-vaunted Coal21 fund to help finance research on that technology. In a speech to the Energy Policy Institute of Australia on Friday, Rio Tinto’s head of energy, Harry Kenyon-Slaney, said: “It is clear we can’t just wish away fossil fuels. Any solution to climate change must recognise the ongoing significant role of fossil fuels in the global energy mix. It would simply be impractical and unrealistic not to do so. “Aside from the obvious need to encourage behavioural change to reduce energy wastage, I believe that the answer will come from technological advances and innovative solutions. Raising the efficiency of power stations from the lamentable average of 33% will be one key step and advancing carbon capture and storage will be another.” He said Rio Tinto had spent more than $100m on “activities directed towards the development of carbon capture and storage technology”. But along with other Australian black coal producers, Rio has also “paused”, from 2012-13, contributions to what was supposed to become a $1bn industry fund to finance clean coal technology “in response to difficult trading conditions in the industry”. The objectives of Coal21, set up in 2006, have also been changed to allow it to use funding already collected for advocacy and promoting the use of coal. Its constitution now allows money to be spent on “promoting the use of coal both within Australia and overseas and promoting the economic and social benefits of the coal industry”. A spokesman for the Minerals Council of Australia said it was “axiomatic” that a healthy coal industry was necessary for more money to be spent on clean coal research. He said no money from the fund was being spent on advocacy and promotion at the moment and it was unrelated to the global campaign by Peabody Energy – which has been prominent in many Australian news outlets – to promote fossil fuels as the answer to world “energy poverty”. The “Advanced Energy for Life” campaign describes energy poverty as “the world’s No 1 human and environmental crisis”. The interim chief executive of Australian Coal Association Low Emissions Technologies (ACALET), Greg Sullivan, said “despite difficult operating conditions, the Australian coal industry is continuing to in invest in low emissions technology development. There has been a pause in levy liabilities but ACALET has and continues to commit new money to projects.” It is understood the new investments would come from funds already collected. It has cash reserves of about $26m.

None,"Rio Tinto and Citi lift miners, but FTSE falters after recent rise",Business,95,None,"A strong performance from mining companies was not enough to lift leading shares to their fifth successive day of gains. After Wednesday's jump to a near eight month high the FTSE 100 paused for breath, slipping 4.44 points to 6815.42. But a positive note from Citigroup and a well received update from Rio Tinto helped support the mining sector. Rio said it expected to reach a production rate for iron ore of 290m tonnes a year by mid-2014, up 9% on last year, as it attempted to meet demand from China, pushing its shares up 80.5p to 3334.5p. Meanwhile Citigroup analysts moved from neutral to bullish on the sector for the first time in three years. They said: While we remain concerned about the potential long-term structurally demand story for commodities in China, and we are cognisant of a potentially seasonal slowdown in the first quarter of this year, our move reflects better bottom up fundamentals, particularly from the major miners. We would rather be too early than too late in making this call. So Antofagasta added 42.5p to 832.5p, Anglo American was up 65p at 1397.5p and BHP Billiton 68.5p better at ?18.60. Glencore Xstrata climbed 7.75p to 327.20p following reports a Chinese consortium was close to buying its Las Bambas copper mine in Peru. It was Super Thursday for the retailing sector, with a host of high street names reporting on their festive trading. And a mixed bag it was too. Dixons Retail saw a 3% rise in like for like sales in period over Christmas but its shares lost 3.29p to 47.11p as it cautioned on the outlook. Primark owner Associated British Foods dropped 71p to ?26.25. For ABF it was a weaker than expected performance from its sugar business which has left investors nervous, and Numis moved its recommendation from hold to sell. But Halfords was 31.5p higher at 492.5p while Argos and Homebase owner Home Retail rose 3.1p to 204.1p. United Utilities added 30p to 689p after Morgan Stanley lifted its recommendation from equal weight to overweight. It said: The 2014 regulatory review will clearly be tough but this is surely well known. We expect clarity on allowed returns shortly, which should remove uncertainty, and we think fears of dividend cuts are overdone. United Utilities is our top pick – it trades close to regulated capital value and offers good value – hence we move to overweight. Elsewhere BSkyB dropped 24.5p to 845p after Credit Suisse cut its price target from 700p to 600p and reduced its earnings forecast on the prospect of the company putting in a knockout bid for the next Premier League rights to knock upstart bidder BT , down 5.2p at 380.8p, out of the game. The bank said the next rights auction was likely to be the most competitive in the league's history. Intertek was the biggest faller in the leading index, down 100p at ?28.79 after Berenberg downgraded the testing equipment group. The bank said: Despite recent guidance from Intertek that organic growth was set to stabilise in the fourth quarter, we believe that the industry-wide negatives experienced in the first half of 2013 have continued into the second, driven by weakness in the minerals market, challenging conditions in Europe and lower growth in the industrial inspection market following two years of exceptionally high growth. For the second half of 2013 we estimate organic growth of just 2.8% (versus the 6.3% reported in the first half), which implies only 2% growth in the last two months of 2013. While 2014 should see fewer extremes, we believe that Intertek's organic growth will be well below the 9% achieved by the company in the last decade; we have now revised down our estimate to 4.9%. The shares have been flat in the last 12 months; however with consensus earnings per share estimates having been revised downwards by 7%, Intertek trades on a full 2015 PE of 18.3 times. With further downward pressure on consensus estimates and a likely deterioration of the top line, we lower our recommendation from buy to hold and we lower our price target to ?30 [from ?33]. Lower down the market SVG Capital slid 41.5p to 424.5p as Aegon more than halved its stake in the private equity firm by selling 20m shares at 420p each to raise ?84m. Aegon has retained 7.9% of SVG. Premier Oil , which has projects in the North Sea, Vietnam and the Falklands, dropped 20p to 288p after a disappointing update suggesting flat production levels in 2014. The company forecast it would produce 58,000 to 63,000 barrels of oil a day this year, compared to expected production of 58,200 for 2013. The target for last year had already been revised down several times. Finally, Pilat Media jumped 23% to 90.5p after privately owned rival SintecMedia made an agreed 95p a share or ?63.3m cash offer for the business. The two companies work together developing business management software for broadcasters, and Sintec already holds a near 23% stake in its target.",2014/1/17 4:06,Performance|Customer Orientation,Business Impact & Operational Outcomes|Shareholder & Investor Returns|Localization & Market Adaptation|Market Valuation & Economic Outlook,"{""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""positive"", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""positive"", ""Localization & Market Adaptation"": ""positive"", ""Market Valuation & Economic Outlook"": ""positive""}",1,"{""Business Impact & Operational Outcomes"": ""Rio said it expected to reach a production rate for iron ore of 290m tonnes a year by mid-2014, up 9% on last year"", ""Shareholder & Investor Returns"": ""pushing its shares up 80.5p to 3334.5p"", ""Localization & Market Adaptation"": ""a well received update from Rio Tinto helped support the mining sector."", ""Market Valuation & Economic Outlook"": ""Rio Tinto and Citi lift miners""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto and NSW deny abusing planning process to expedite coal mine,World news,94,None,"Mining giant Rio Tinto and the NSW government have flatly denied claims they are abusing the planning process to expedite a coal mine expansion approval, and have rejected suggestions they coerced workers into submitting positive submissions to the state government. On Thursday the Newcastle Herald reported that employees of the Rio Tinto-managed Coal & Allied Warkworth mine in the Hunter Valley were “effectively forced” to write submissions to the state government supporting Rio Tinto’s application to expand the mine. The vast majority of the 1,300 submissions received were positive. The district president of the construction, forestry, mining and energy union, Peter Jordan, said employees were “pulled off their shift to fill out submissions”. A spokesman for Coal & Allied told Guardian Australia that while employees were invited to make submissions, none were forced to and none were told it must be positive. “It is entirely appropriate to keep our workforce, whose livelihoods depend on the future of the operation, informed about the Warkworth modification application process and to provide them with the opportunity and guidance to voice their opinions and have their say in a public process that directly affects them, should they choose to do so,” he said. “Our employees have a vested interest in the future of the mining industry. At all times correspondence with employees has been clear that if they choose to make a submission in relation to the Warkworth modification, that it would be entirely voluntary and confidential.” The spokesman also denied allegations that the company had held back Christmas payments from union members while giving payments to non-union employees, saying the different payments related to different workplace agreements. “A new enterprise agreement was not accepted earlier this year at Mount Thorley Warkworth and the current enterprise agreement at Mount Thorley Warkworth has a business performance payment (BPP) entitlement for employees up to 2012,” he said. While the NSW Department of Planning and Infrastructure conceded it did ""expedite"" its assessment of Rio Tinto's application to extend a Hunter Valley mine, it said all community rights were retained. The Lock the Gate Alliance and Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association (BMPA) wrote to planning minister Brad Hazzard on Thursday, accusing the state government of colluding with Rio Tinto to bypass due process. Rio Tinto has applied to extend its Warkworth mine operation and the planning department has recommended it be approved. The department says the modification sought would increase the mining footprint by 1%. But Lock The Gate Alliance's Steve Phillips questioned the level of scrutiny given to Rio Tinto. He said it took 21 days from the time the miner submitted its application until the department recommended the approval. ""It is patently impossible that the mining giant gave any consideration to community attitudes or expert advice in that time,"" he said. In a statement on Friday, the department said it was acutely aware of the concerns raised about the mine. ""We are also conscious that the mine employs some 1,300 people and the constraints on the existing operations put these jobs at risk,"" the statement read. The department said in ""consideration of the important local factors at play"" it decided to expedite the assessment. ""However, all existing legal and community rights have been retained throughout, including the right for the community to have its say,"" the statement read. Rio Tinto gained approval from the NSW government for a larger extension of the same mine this year, but the land and environment court overturned the approval following a challenge from BMPA. Rio Tinto and the O'Farrell government have launched action in the court of appeal to appeal the land and environment court ruling. Lock the Gate and BPMA argue Rio's most recent application is in the same area the land and environment court ruled mining should not take place. A Rio Tinto spokesman said the Warkworth application was for a minor modification that would help protect 1,300 jobs for the next two years. He said, after four years of consultation around the mine, it was ""disingenuous"" to claim the current application needed to be further delayed. ""Rio Tinto has a dedicated and highly experienced team who worked around the clock to assess and respond appropriately to all objections once the public exhibition period closed,"" he said in a statement. ""The implications of the minor modification now being sought are extremely well understood, thereby allowing the company to respond to submissions in a timely manner."" Premier Barry O'Farrell told ABC radio he was confident the planning department operated with openness and transparency.

None,Radioactive spill: similar incident at Rio Tinto mine days earlier,Business,91,None,"A week before a uranium mine in Kakadu National Park spilled a million litres of radioactive slurry a Rio Tinto-owned African mine had a similar accident. Rio Tinto owns Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), the company which operates the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory, where a crack in a leach tank turned into a massive spill in the early hours of Saturday. ERA said it had completed its preliminary inspections and was satisfied the surrounding area was safe and Kakadu had not been contaminated, but there were still concerns in the scientific and Indigenous communities that rain had the potential to carry the contaminated slurry. On 3 December, a similar accident happened at Rossing, a mine in Namibia owned by Rio Tinto, with the company reporting a leach tank failed but it did not say how much of the radioactive slurry – which, like the Ranger spill, also contained acid – was spilled. It said some employees were treated at the scene for “minor” injuries and there was no environmental impact. The leach tank had structural damage and Rio Tinto was investigating the cause of the spill. Dr Gavin Mudd, an environmental engineer from Monash University, said it was too early to say the national park and creeks surrounding the Ranger mine were completely safe, though at this stage it did appear the spill had been contained within the mining operation. Mudd said because of rainfall there would “almost definitely” be some contamination outside the mine, but only to a small degree and it would be diluted. “The primary issue is that it breached the containment lines. They should not fail, ever,” Mudd said. “It’s an extremely important failure.” Mudd said it was concerning Rio Tinto had two mines with similar spills in the same week and that could point to a “lack of maintenance, lack of oversight, continual deterrence of maintenance … maybe construction quality”. The Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation’s chief executive, Justin O’Brien, said there had been no independent verification of ERA’s claims that the environment and surrounding park had not been affected by the spill on Saturday. An indigenous community of about 60 Mirarr people live about 7km downstream from where the spill happened. “How can the Mirarr [people] be expected to trust a company that has continuously reassured them and yet continues to have major failures of protocol and infrastructure?” he said. “The Office of the Supervising Scientist is not politically independent. Without a comprehensive, independent audit of the entire ageing Ranger operation the Mirarr will continue to be deeply concerned for the safety of people and country.” The Ranger uranium mine has had a chequered history when it comes to safety breaches dating back to 1979, when there were two diesel spillages within months of each other. In 2011 the mine had to close for months after its tailing ponds almost overflowed and it was forced to pump contaminated water into one of its mines to prevent it going into Kakadu National Park. The year before, a review found the mine had been leaking 100,000 litres per day of contaminated water into fissures beneath Kakadu, although it has not been established where the leaked water went or what its effect on the environment would be. Rio Tinto and the supervising scientist, Richard McAllister, did not respond to a request for comment. The mine was suspended from processing uranium on Monday by the federal government as it launched an audit of the site. ERA has applied to open another uranium mine 22km from the Ranger site but has said it will not go ahead without the permission of the Mirarr people.",2013/12/11 8:30,Well-being|Ethical Responsibility|Execution|Accountability,Health & Safety|Environmental Protection & Resource Management|Infrastructure & Maintenance|Community Engagement & Social Responsibility|Corporate Governance & Oversight|Transparency & Disclosure,"{""Health & Safety"": ""negative"", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""negative"", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""negative"", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""negative"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative"", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""negative""}",0.95,"{""Health & Safety"": ""A week before a uranium mine in Kakadu National Park spilled a million litres of radioactive slurry a Rio Tinto-owned African mine had a similar accident."", ""Environmental Protection & Resource Management"": ""rain had the potential to carry the contaminated slurry."", ""Infrastructure & Maintenance"": ""“lack of maintenance, lack of oversight, continual deterrence of maintenance … maybe construction quality”."", ""Community Engagement & Social Responsibility"": ""“How can the Mirarr [people] be expected to trust a company that has continuously reassured them and yet continues to have major failures of protocol and infrastructure?”"", ""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""The mine was suspended from processing uranium on Monday by the federal government as it launched an audit of the site."", ""Transparency & Disclosure"": ""no independent verification of ERA’s claims that the environment and surrounding park had not been affected by the spill on Saturday.""}",The Guardian

None,Olympic medal mining firm Rio Tinto faces air pollution lawsuit in US,Business,86,None,"The British mining company that provided the gold, silver and bronze for London 2012 Olympic medals is being sued over claims of ""illegal air pollution"" at the open pit mine that produced the Olympic metals. Doctors, environmentalists and concerned citizens are suing the London-based mining company Rio Tinto in a case that starts on Tuesday. They allege the ?60bn company violated clean air laws at the US mine that produced 99% of the metals used in the 4,700 Olympic and Paralympic medals. The lawsuit filed at Utah district court against Rio subsidiary Kennecott claims the Bingham Canyon mine, near Salt Lake City, has breached air pollution laws for five years causing effects doctors called ""similar to smoking 20 cigarettes a day"". Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment (UPHE), one of the groups of claimants, said dust from the mine can be ""absorbed into the bloodstream, causing respiratory system damage, adverse pulmonary [heart and lungs] effects and potentially even premature death"". The claimants, which also include Utah Moms for Clean Air and environmental group Wildearth Guardians, say the mine has been ""emitting particle matter at levels in excess of those allowed by the US Clean Air Act"" for at least five years. Rio Tinto denies the claims. Claimants allege emissions from the mine, known locally as the ""biggest man-made hole on Earth"", are a ""major health threat to citizens living along the Wasatch Front [the northern part of Utah including the cities of Salt Lake City, Provo and Ogden]"". The boss of Rio Tinto ? which made $4.2bn (?2.6bn) profit in the first half of this year ? had said the medals were made of some of the most ethically and environmentally friendly metals ever sourced. Tom Albanese, who was CEO of Rio Tinto until earlier this year, said when the company won the London 2012 contract : ""Being ethically responsible is a thread that runs through everything we do. We aim to bring long-lasting positive change to the communities where we work, respecting human rights, bringing economic benefits and looking after the environment … We have rigorous standards for air quality, ecosystems, biodiversity, climate change, the use of energy, land and water and waste disposal."" The metals used in the medals, which weighed 14?oz (397g) each, were nearly all sourced from Bingham Canyon. The company refined 44kg of gold, 6 tonnes of silver and a couple of tonnes of copper to make the medals. Bronze is an alloy of copper, zinc and tin. Tin was added from mines in England and Australia. Rio Tinto donated the metals, worth $7.3m, to London 2012 organisers in return for publicity rights. The lawsuit claims doctors had been ""adversely affected"" by the emissions from the mine, owned by Kennecott Utah Copper, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto. ""On days with severe particulate matter [pollution] in Salt Lake, doctors have found the effect on people who are consistently outdoors is similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day."" UPHE said: ""These emissions are offensive to observe, particularly given Utah Physicians' knowledge of the adverse health effects of such pollution and pose a significant threat to health, wellbeing and quality of life. ""Utah Physicians feel ethically obligated to confront this illegal pollution in order to protect the health and welfare of its members, patients, friends, families and communities."" In its defence documents, the company said the mine ""complied with the relevant provisions of Utah's particle material [emissions] state implementation plan at all times"". ""For over 15 years, Kennecott has operated an ambient air quality monitoring station at Copperton, Utah, which station is located to detect potential particulate matter impacts from Bingham Canyon Mine. This monitoring station consistently shows air quality readings well below the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).""

None,Former Rio Tinto boss joins Vedanta,Business,99,None,"Tom Albanese, the former chief executive of Rio Tinto, has been appointed by fellow mining company Vedanta as chairman of one of its subsidiaries. Albanese resigned from the top job at Rio after more than 30 years with the company, taking responsibility for a $14bn (?8.8bn) write-down following bad deals. He will not sit on Vedanta's main board, but instead will chair Vedanta Resources Holdings, which sits in between the main board and the miner's operating companies. ""In this role, Tom will be actively involved in continuing to develop the company's strategy, policies and growth objectives,"" the FTSE 100 miner said on Monday. Albanese will advise both Vedanta's chairman, Anil Agarwal, and chief executive, Mahendra Mehta, in the new role, which takes effect immediately. Agarwal said he looked forward to bringing Albanese's ""considerable experience and energy to Vedanta to support our twin aims of delivering sustainable growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders"". Vedanta is London-based but with the bulk of its operations in India. It produces aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, silver, iron ore, oil and gas and commercial energy.

None,Rio Tinto rises after Australian job cuts as markets await Bernanke,Business,113,None,"As market nerves grow ahead of the US Federal Reserve announcement later, Rio Tinto has moved higher after job cuts and a broker recommendation. The mining giant is cutting more than 40 office jobs in its Australian iron ore division, to reflect changing market conditions. Chief executive Sam Walsh unveiled plans earlier this year to save $5bn of costs over the next two years. Meanwhile Citigroup added the miner to its most favoured stock list, helping its shares climb 52p to ?28.63 and making it the biggest riser in the leading index. Citi said Rio ""remains our mining team's favoured large-cap UK diversified miner."" Bank of America also issued a buy note on Rio as part of a metals and mining report. Overall the FTSE 100 has slipped 29.10 points to 6345.11, as investors wait for Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's latest pronouncements, in particular for any news on the future of its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Central bank actions to boost the global economy have been supporting the markets for months, but in May Bernanke spooked investors by suggesting an end could be in sight. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said: Heading into this [Federal Reserve] meeting, investors this week have scaled back expectations of an immediate unwinding of stimulus by the Fed, hopeful that the patchy run of data from the US economy will prevent a reduction in asset purchases in the near term. Traders are hopeful the Fed will shed some light on a timeframe of reducing the pace of QE and downplay the markets' over-reaction since 22 May. A number of companies went ex-dividend including Severn Trent , down 62p at ?17.03, and United Utilities , 26.5p lower at 700p. Among the mid-caps Micro Focus International jumped nearly 7% to 691p after the software group's full year earnings of $188m beat market expectations. Julian Yates at Investec said: Headline 2013 earnings are 3% ahead of our forecast, with solid progress in core COBAL licences and also Main Frame solutions, albeit aided by a large first half deal. Test licences continue to decline materially, as already factored into our forecasts. Of interest is that .... the company has stated it will now return to M&A if returns are superior versus the continued cash return strategy of the past couple of years. This could create some debate. We remain buyers. But Imagination Technologies has fallen 6.1p to 299.1p after the chip designer reported a fall in profits from ?36.8m to ?34.3m. Last month the group said it had suffered delays in signing licencing deals in the second half, but now says it has made a good start to the year. Lorne Daniel at finnCap said: A poor set of results – as expected, following the recent trading update. Adjusted pretax profit is down 7% to ?34.3m, hit by both the losses in [digital radio business] Pure and a slowdown in licensing sales. There was poor cash conversion, seeing a ?4m cash outflow from operations, leaving net cash of ?45.6m after the cost of acquiring [processing technology company] MIPS; however, there was also a liability of ?56.3m (since paid) for the patent sale tax liability, leaving an actual net debt position of ?10.7m. Royalty revenue continues to grow strongly (up 49% year on year) but licensing has let the business down (down 15% year on year and even more sharply in the second half, down 26% on last year), highlighting the increasing pressure of competition in the mobile graphics chip space, notably from Qualcomm.",2013/6/19 18:38,Performance|Execution,Workforce & Team Performance|Cost Management & Resource Efficiency,"{""Workforce & Team Performance"": ""positive"", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""positive""}",0.92,"{""Workforce & Team Performance"": ""The mining giant is cutting more than 40 office jobs in its Australian iron ore division, to reflect changing market conditions."", ""Cost Management & Resource Efficiency"": ""Chief executive Sam Walsh unveiled plans earlier this year to save $5bn of costs over the next two years.""}",The Guardian
None,Rio Tinto accused of environmental and human rights breaches,Business,97,None,"Protesters from around the world attacked mining company Rio Tinto for a string for alleged environmental and human rights breaches during a fiery meeting with shareholders in London on Thursday. Native Mongolian herders claimed that a $5bn (?3.3bn) expansion of the company's Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in the Gobi desert threatened the fresh water supply of hundreds of nomadic people and the area's unique ecology. Sukhgerel Dugersuren, executive director of Mongolian civil society organisation Oyu Tolgoi Watch, said: ""Water is a life and death resource. Rio Tinto is diverting water without the consent of the local community or the government. ""It is already evident that not only livestock but local communities are losing access to adequate water supply. Pasture ... [and] water resources are being taken from us and fenced in by the mine."" She claimed that a tailings pond used to collect waste material from the mine had leaked and told Rio's board that the local community demanded assurances that ""there isn't going to be a catastrophe in the region"". Sam Walsh, Rio's new chief executive, said the company was committed to environmental protection and human rights and was closely monitoring the mine's development to ""ensure our neighbours have a healthy and prosperous future"". At the company's annual meeting, Walsh said Rio recognised the importance of water and would draw water from a deep level aquifer, not from surface water. He said a seasonal river was being diverted around the mine, but the company would create a new spring for animal grazing and water collection further downstream. Walsh said the mine, which is 34%-owned by the Mongolian government, would provide a massive boost to the local economy and could represent up to 36% of Mongolia's GDP.

None,Rio Tinto falls into the red on coal and aluminium acquisitions,Business,111,None,"Anglo-Australian mining group Rio Tinto posted a $3bn (?1.93bn) loss for 2012 after taking a $14bn writedown from its aluminum business and the acquisition of a coal company in Mozambique. The loss – compared with a profit of $5.8bn in 2011 – came after two senior executives, Tom Albanese and Doug Ritchie, stepped down last month after acknowledging that developing infrastructure in Mozambique was more challenging than expected. It also needed to cut its estimates of recoverable coal volumes. Underlying earnings dropped 40% to $9.3bn because of falling commodities prices. Revenue from operations declined 40% to $16.5bn. Sam Walsh, the new chief executive, announced plans to cut costs by $5bn at the world's third-largest diversified mining company. Rio Tinto sacked chief executive Tom Albanese in January as it revealed a $14bn (?8.7bn) writedown in connection with his two most significant acquisitions, Mozambican coal mining and the Alcan aluminium group.

None,Ousted Rio Tinto boss pocketed ?22m in cash and shares,Business,88,None,"Tom Albanese, ousted from Rio Tinto on Thursday after a series of disastrous acquisitions, pocketed almost ?22m in cash and share options during his stint leading the mining company, which ended abruptly in the wake of a further $14bn (?8.8bn) writedown. The company said Albanese, who will not receive his contractual entitlement of an ?8m payoff when he leaves the company in July, will be immediately replaced by Sam Walsh, the 63-year-old head of its iron ore division which is Rio's largest and most profitable business. Doug Ritchie, who led Rio's acquisition of its Mozambique coal business, also stepped down by ""mutual agreement"". The changes came after the company admitted that the value of its aluminium assets had slumped once again – this time by up to $11bn following an $8.9bn writedown last year. The total rose to $14bn after the company added that its coal assets in Mozambique, which it paid $4bn for in 2011, were now worth just $1bn. It is also expecting smaller writedowns in other businesses totalling around $500m. Rio's chairman Jan du Plessis said: ""The Rio Tinto board fully acknowledges that a writedown of this scale in relation to the relatively recent Mozambique acquisition is unacceptable. We are also deeply disappointed to have to take a further substantial writedown in our aluminium businesses, albeit in an industry that continues to experience significant adverse changes globally."" The company said a ""further deterioration in aluminium market conditions … together with strong currencies in certain regions and high energy and raw material costs"" had caused the latest revaluation of its aluminium operations, while in Mozambique it misjudged the ease with which it would gain approval to transport coal by barge on the Zambezi river. Rio paid $38bn in cash to buy Canada-based aluminium group Alcan in June 2007, shortly before the worst of the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and shortly after Albanese became chief executive. The deal, which left Rio with large debts, led to a $15.2bn rights issue, while the first writedown also prompted Albanese to forgo his 2011 bonus. One major Rio shareholder, who pressed Albanese to abort the Alcan deal, said: ""This is a big writedown. For that to come on the back of the first and wipe out such a large chunk of value is shocking. Hopefully this will be a reminder to the mining industry not to get carried away when the going is good with regards to takeovers and capital expenditure. The industry is littered with examples of deals being done at the top of the market when chief executives' blood is flowing."" While Du Plessis paid tribute to the decades-long service of both Albanese and Ritchie, he was keen to point out that the pair would be receiving ""no lump sum payment, no annual short-term performance bonus for 2012 or 2013 [and] no long-term share award for 2013"". He added: ""Quite frankly the world has changed and I believe very strongly that large corporations are going to have to be more sensitive about societal expectations."" Albanese and Ritchie will both receive base pay, benefits and pension contributions until they leave in the summer. In total Albanese had already earned almost ?11m in salary since being promoted to chief executive in May 2007, while his unexercised share options from the 2003-09 period are his to keep – and are also worth almost ?11m. Furthermore, he leaves with a pension that, at the end of 2011, was calculated to pay out a yearly sum of ?476,000, which would cost around ?8.5m to buy in the open market. Shares in Rio lost 18.5p to ?34.40 although market watchers said that most investors had already written-down Rio's assets in their own calculations. Nic Stanojevic, an analyst at stockbrokers Brewin Dolphin, said: ""We think the more important driver for the shares has been the iron ore price which was down 5% overnight."" What is a writedown? A writedown, or impairment charge, is an accounting term that means a company no longer believes that the value of certain assets on its balance sheet can be justified. As a result, it will take a hit to its annual profits – though this may not be accompanied by much of a change in the company's cashflows. Companies often invite investors not to dwell on these ""non-cash"", one-off charges, and to focus on ""underlying"" profit performance. Writedowns are designed to draw a line under discrete issues facing a business, allowing it to move on. However, they are not always final, and contain a good deal of guesswork. The company may later be forced to make further writedowns; the original writedown can also turn out to have been overly pessimistic. On one level, writedowns are an accounting technicality. However, they are a clear indication that a company has made poor investment decisions. The CEO who failed to avert a crisis Tom Albanese has two degrees in mineral economics from the University of Alaska and is a huge Sudoku fan. Yet he never quite mastered the puzzle of handling mining investors during almost six years running Rio Tinto. Albanese was promoted to chief executive just before the Rio's acquisition of Alcan in 2007 - having joined Rio after it acquired his previous employer, NERCO, in 1993. But while he was not entirely to blame for what turned out to be a total disaster, shareholders recall how their protests to the new boss at the time were waved away. From there, the company descended into crisis under Albanese and, in a desperate attempt to repair the balance sheet, he went begging to China with the proposal of a $20bn (?12bn) injection from the state-owned Chinalco. Chairman-designate Jim Leng was unimpressed and quit. The shareholders eventually insisted on recapitalising Rio themselves via a $15bn rights issue. A bounce-back in commodity prices helped restore Albanese's reputation in the City for a while but the first write-down in the value of Alcan prompted him to waive his 2011 bonus at the beginning of last year.",2013/1/18 8:40,Accountability,Corporate Governance & Oversight,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""negative""}",0.8,"{""Corporate Governance & Oversight"": ""The Rio Tinto board fully acknowledges that a writedown of this scale in relation to the relatively recent Mozambique acquisition is unacceptable.

None,The Albanese years at Rio Tinto: a squandered opportunity,Business,86,None,"Tom Albanese had been on borrowed time at Rio Tinto for about four years. It was in early 2009 that the chief executive was obliged to confront his horrible mistake in paying $38bn – in cash, for heaven's sake – at the top of the commodities cycle in 2007 for Alcan, a major aluminium producer. Was it hubris, an attempt to bulk up to forestall a bid from arch-rival BHP Billiton, or an inherited deal from the former chairman Paul Skinner that prompted a gamble that, even at the time , smacked of staying on the dance floor too long? Whatever it was, the BHP bid arrived anyway – and then went away in the post-pop commodity world. The damage to Rio's balance sheet remained and Albanese's proposed repair job was humiliating. He wanted to flog minority stakes in some of Rio's operations to Chinalco, a Chinese state-owned firm, thereby creating a political storm in Australia. He was saved from himself only by the subsequent bounce-back in commodity prices, which gave shareholders the confidence to recapitalise Rio themselves via a $15bn rights issue. Calm was restored as the price of iron ore – the source of most of Rio's profit – headed skyward again. By early 2011, the company was generating cash at a rate of $64m a day, or $1m every 23 minutes. The balance sheet was once again pristine. All Albanese had to do was avoid shooting himself in the foot with another over-priced acquisition. He failed. In 2011, the never-ending struggle to diversify earnings led to a $4bn offer for Riversdale, a Mozambique coal miner. Today Rio wrote down the value of the asset by an extraordinary $3bn, or 75%. The problem? The company hasn't won the expected permits to transport coal along the Zambezi river and the estimate of recoverable coal has been cut. Basic stuff, in other words. To rub salt into shareholders' wounds, Alcan isn't judged to be worth even its written-down value. Another almighty impairment charge – $10bn-$11bn – in aluminium has been unveiled. The total from aluminium is now almost $30bn, with Alcan the major culprit. Albanese's departure by ""mutual consent"" was inevitable. By all accounts, he's terrific at the nuts-and-bolts business of organising the management of operations. But in the past decade's rollercoaster market for miners, success and failure has been dictated by acquisition strategy. The primary task of a chief executive was to avoid buying assets at the wrong time at the wrong price. Albanese has two stinkers on his record – one at the absolute peak of the market, one when on deal-doing probation – plus a highly dilutive rights issue. The chairman, Jan du Plessis, is being commendably strict in limiting Albanese's payoff, and that of Doug Ritchie, who was the day-to-day executive on the Mozambique misadventure. But a measure of how great Rio could have been for its shareholders is seen in the value of Albanese's unexercised share options from the 2003-09 period – ie pre-Alcan – which he'll obviously keep. Even with the calamities, these are still worth ?10.7m. If the mishaps and the emergency cash call hadn't happened, who knows? But miles more. The pricing dynamics in iron ore, where Rio is the world's second-largest producer, are almost heaven-sent. It costs the company about $47 to dig a tonne of the stuff out of the Pilbara desert in Australia and ship it to China, where it can currently be sold to steelmakers for $145. That's why Sam Walsh, the new boss, starts on the front foot.
