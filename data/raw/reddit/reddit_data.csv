Just seeking any feedback from those who have done the onboarding process with Rio Tinto.

Have not heard anything since. Would have expected maybe a generic email from HR but nothing. I was advised that it can be a slow process and not to quit my current job, which is fine. 

Just curious if anyone else has experience in the process and can shed some light on a timeframe/next steps.

I'm all for hiring more women in male dominated work places, but only if the policy is to get more women to apply thus making it far more likely a woman will be the best applicant. 

If the policy is simply hire more women then if ten people were interviewed for a job,  9 men and one woman,  you already know who's getting the job. You also know there's a good chance she wasn't the best applicant and she will be treated as a diversity hire on site. Unfortunately so will most women,  even though many will be employed because they were the best applicant.  The bulk of the men will just assume a woman is there because of her extra x chromosome and nothing more.

1g5c4ap,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto ($RIO)",Rippedyanu1,120,124,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining U stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operation Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If They were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 2, 3 4+ Billion USD per year for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company current has 200 million in liquid cash right now, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen (NXE) deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO), specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

My positions:

1300 shares at 5.37 a share  
5 January 25 5C calls  
5 November 25 6C calls  
12 January 25 6C calls  
10 December 7C calls  
100 November 7C calls (regard gambit for pennies)  

If you missed the start of space stock frenzy a few months back, here’s your next chance. Don’t bitch to me later if you miss the boat.

1k6x0if,Rio Tinto u Bosni,hajpristes,61,47,"Rodom sam iz Srebrenice. Retko dolazim, ali kad i dođem, uvek odem do Gubera (nekadašnjeg lokaliteta banje Guber). To je pravo čudo prirode: zemljište je obogaćeno kojekakvim rudama (izvinite, ne znam pravi izraz za to), vode koje protiču kroz samu banju su lekovite zbog tih ruda, sama korita/izvorišta su crvene boje, vazduh je neverovatno kvalitetan, itd itd.

E pa, danas sam otišla do gore, i čuvena očna voda jedva kaplje. Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto.

Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište.

Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga?

Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi. Rimljani su isto tu napravili prokop (da bi prenosili rude do Sasa, to prokopište se i dalje nalazi tu i vidi lepo).

This post will surely get a lot of hate, but i see a lot of uninformed people spreading FUD either cause they lost money or want to troll. Hopefully this helps anyone that’s serious about their investment and needs some reassurance. The main thing that’s caused some confusion is the fact that most people only read or know about the 6-K and not the 20-F. The 6-K is only a summary of the 20-F that’s published in a PR format for easier reading. Depending on the company, you can find future guidance and some of the juicier things in the 6-K, but that wasn’t the case for us.

My aim with this post is to provide information on some of the things we’ve found in the 20-F that might be unknown to some of you.

#Israel Railways

https://preview.redd.it/ckkaybqp18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5433734f83f77b64486a1ca734513c90c0cb4d

This excerpt highlights the current stage of their deal with Israeli Railways and what we can expect to come from them in the future. A lot people assumed that they were already paid for the 10 Main Line systems from January 31st 2023, but from our understanding based on this screenshot, seems like they’re still owed the majority of this amount once they finish installing the last of the systems. We suspect it took them this long because they needed to be certified first before installing their tech on passenger units, there isn’t much information on that currently. 


https://preview.redd.it/fjbjikfh18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9d92ee654dfb023b4f432592844da0de5d980e

As you can see this one is a bit different and goes into detail of just how huge this deal could be for Rail Vision in the near future. They have a long history working together and this is Rail Vision’s turf so i wouldn’t be surprised if this is where they get their first “big” contract. Installing their tech on 300 trains and possibly doubling that to 600 units for bidirectional functionality is a massive opportunity. At this stage, their tech would be recognized as successful and profitable for the business and would also help attract further interest from outside parties.



#Rio Tinto Iron Core

https://preview.redd.it/6yffowta18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ed7b31d07138242a535c6677912b4e65a0a480

This is a big one, a lot of us rightfully assumed that Rio Tinto was dead in the water so this is new to us and very important. From what we can read here, this deal is very similar to the one from India. Rail Vision signed a supply agreement with Hitachi Rail STS to provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing. The pilot ended in August 2022 and since then we haven’t heard anything from them. The thing is that they stopped testing altogether, they haven’t done pilots with any other company since then. It seems that they’ve been reviewing the data gathered by us and they’ve been planning the next phase to possibly procure our tech. This is evident now that they’re releasing tenders in Q2 2025 and Rail Vision is participating. Nothing is publicly confirmed as of yet, but this could be an unexpected catalyst before EOY.




#Existing Pilots

https://preview.redd.it/pnygldc818se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76e1af49c244af41f9f2e0bd98859cad235cc60d

From this paragraph right here we get a bit more information on how it is that they roll out their units for pilot testing. So first it mentions how they have multiple pilots running at the same time, these are the ones from North America, Central America, India and presumably South America with Vale. Most of these pilots started around the same time in 2024 and based on current data, we can expect these to finish by mid 2025. 



#Financials - Balance Sheet and Runway

As of Dec 2024, Rail Vision had $17.5M in cash, up from $3.3M the year prior. This comes from $24.1M in gross raised through private placements, warrant exercises, and the equity line.

With operating cash burn at $9.7M for 2024, they currently have about 1.5 to 2 years of runway if spending remains the same, more if pilot contracts convert and revenue goes up. That gives them time to push pilots into rollouts without needing to dilute.




#Research and Development (RnD)

https://preview.redd.it/rfwlwmzy08se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d0bdb1e50f461ca93e9ae3f45c94af45f3c861

Rail Vision’s RnD expenses for the year 2024 were $5.28 million, down from $7.15 million in 2023. This shows a 26% decrease YoY.

From this paragraph we can see they reduced their RnD team by 12 employees and spent less on equipment and materials. This is a positive sign as they’re phasing out of the heavy RnD phase, we should expect this trend to continue for future reports. 

Additionally there are some things i found regarding what they’re currently working on when it comes to RnD. These include: Maintenance and Predictive Maintenance, Data Services and Mapping. 




#Operating Loss

https://preview.redd.it/gu1vpv4218se1.jpg?width=1256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fbdf2cc8a217656ba9bfc59702ed17435be57a

Rail Vision reported an operating loss of $9 million which is an improvement from the $11.4 million in 2023. This is a 21% reduction YoY.

The two main reasons for this reduction are the reduced expenses from RnD which are down $1.87 million and also the higher revenue generated of $1.3 million. Again, we can expect these figures to get better and better in future reports. 

They’re improving on operational efficiency and they’re proving that they know what they’re doing when it comes to the management of their finances. If the prior pilots convert to full contracts in 2025 then we can expect profitability by H2 2025.  



#Opportunity Roadmap

https://preview.redd.it/74ivfo3k28se1.jpg?width=1312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57300b1f6ccef324b2026d92aec25bbd92bd2d2f

Also wanted to share a roadmap from u/Time_Shoulder_1493, i think its a good visual to show all of the active pilots and everything else Rail Vision is working on.



#Closing Remarks

In my own personal opinion, this ER is exactly what we expected. There isn’t any surprises when it comes to their financials, they’re reducing expenses by cutting their biggest spender which is RnD and growing their revenue through multiple clients. I believe this will only get better with time as they finish the current pilots and start gaining contracts. If these contracts come to fruition then i expect profitability by H2 2025.

I know this is a very difficult time we’re going through and  the lack of transparency from management only makes it worse. I believe that the general feeling we’re all experiencing could’ve been avoided if only they communicated with us. The good thing is that they’re working, they have presence in multiple countries and there’s potential contracts in the near future. They seem optimistic about what could possibly happen this year and they’re probably getting promising feedback from their pilots. For now i’ll remain patient and look forward to H1 2025.",2025/4/2 0:06,,Climate Action & Sustainability|Governance & Ethics,"{""Climate Action & Sustainability"": ""negative"", ""Governance & Ethics"": ""negative""}",0.7,"{""Climate Action & Sustainability"": ""corporate lobbying to undermine climate solutions"", ""Governance & Ethics"": ""corporate lobbying to undermine climate solutions""}",Reddit

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

&gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

&gt;*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Isto devido a reputação ganha nos anos 2000. Porem qual a razão por continuar a ser tao espalhada essa imagem decadas depois.?

Eu irei me mudar daqui a umas semanas para a avenida da conduta entre fanzeres e rio tinto. Eu nunca tinha ido para essas zonas, mas ja desde o meu tempo de estudante ouvia as novelas contadas sobre essa zona. Tanto amigos como colegas de trabalho e ate os homens que estao a fazer ad remodelações nao param de dizer, “vais te arrepender, rio tinto nao da para andar a pe sem ser assaltado a noite é de esquecer, carro senao tiver na garagem nem um dia ta sem os vidros partidos, as pessoas sao todas de mau feitio e nao ajudam ninguém, quando for jogo do porto fodem tudo nas ruas, anda sempre de faca no bolso, devias ter ido para gaia ou para a maia onde nao existem gunas é so gente idosa aka os dormitorios do porto etc”.

Porem do que explorei da zona ate agora parece me pacifica e os vizinhos ate agora foram 5* e mesmo funcionários de lojas a que fui e restaurantes, nada de diferente de outras periferias do porto, ve se um guna por entre outro, sim mas isso em nada difere do resto do porto, o guna por m2 em zonas como paranhos, matosinhos perto do norte e boavista na cm é bem maior e ninguem fala mal dessas zona. 

Claro nao digo que isto seja uma foz do douro ou jardins da arrabida mas nao me parece de todo a imagem que as pessoas fazem passar que isto seja quase o bairro do cerco. Porque é que as pessoas continuam a transmitir esta imagem de fanzeres/rio tinto? Eu tou me a foder para o que as outras pessoas acham mas admito que me mete uns nervos quando alguém pergunta onde comprei casa e eu digo rio tinto e malta ou comenta ou faz uma cara a questionar se porque ali.

1fjdbbq,Debata o iskopavanju Jadarita-Rio Tinto,RimputapaChimbunaba,34,46,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGOCZKA9oLg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGOCZKA9oLg)

Veceras na RTS je bila korisna naucna rasprava u vezi iskopavanja litijuma, dva clana debate su za, a dva protiv rudarenja Jadarita, rekao bih da ovaj jedan (Dejan Ilic) i nije naucnik, ali vredi pogledati.

Za one koji nemaju volje i vremena za to, ukratko cu izneti bitne zakljucke.

Studije i analize koje je iznela kompanija Rio Tinto su Teorijski izvodljive. kada bi stvari gledali teoretski.

Svaki rudnik ima odrdjen uticaj na zivotnu sredinu, samo je pitanje koliko. S obzirom da je Jadar veliki Rudnik,ne kao Bor, ali odredjena kontaminacija bi sigurno postojala. Zbog toga se svi rudnici Litijuma u svetu nalaze u industrijskim zonama i u nenaseljenim mestima, kako bi sve bilo pogodno za eksploataciju.

Dubina na kojoj se nalazi ruda je na 350m do 700m ispod povrsine zemlje, sto je dobro sa ekoloskog aspekta jer se ne radi o povrsinskom kopu.

Litijum se u svetu masovno proizovdi iz minerala spodumena i taj mineral ima istu kolicinu litijuma kao jadarit, s tim sto jadarit ima i natrijum i bor i silicijum, a spodumen se sastoji od litijuma, silicijuma i aluminijuma pa kada se izdvoji Litijum ostaje alumosilikat koji nije opasan po zivotnu sredinu. Tako da bi se morao resavati i problem bora i natrijuma.

Jadarit je i otkriven tako sto se trazio bor, ali trenutno potraznja za borom i bornim jedinjenjima kao prozivodima trenutno nema komercijalnu vrednost, a to potvrdjuje i podatak da Rio Tinto u rudnicima u Kaliforniji poseduje rezerve Bora koji je ostao u otpadu.

Na sadasnjem nivou razvoja tehnologije jos nije izveden proces razdvajanja litijuma od bora bez velike kolicine bora kao otpada i to bi bio novi tehnoloski proces koja se planira u Jadru. 

Kolicina Sumporne kiseline da bi se razlozio Jadarit je 943tona dnevno, koje bi se dovozile u Jadar narednih 10000dana, koliko iznosi period eksploatacije litijuma u Jadru.

Jedne od najvecih rezervi pijacih podzemnih voda se nalaze u Macvi, na 15km od rudnika, postoje brojni rizici kontaminacije tih voda, mogucnost poplava,stvaranja pukotina u vodonepropusnim stenama usled sleganja tla. Rio Tinto je u svojoj studiji naveo da ce ceo rudnik biti podignut iznad nivoa poplavnog talasa iz 2014. godine tako sto ce podici ceo plato rudnika za 4m na POVRSINI OD 220 HEKTARA. Kako?

1g5c5pb,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto",Rippedyanu1,74,34,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale.

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company currently has 200 million in liquid cash, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen's (NXE) Arrow deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO) or close to it, specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto which trades at a 110Billion market cap. If UUUU even becomes worth 20% of that which I think is a fair assessment given the above points (I didn't even get into vanadium mineralization) that would be \~120 a share based on the current float. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

(Bloomberg) -- The US-China dispute over Beijing’s control of rare earth supplies has yet to be resolved, the head of a visiting US congressional delegation said after meeting Chinese officials, signaling a key irritant persists in bilateral relations.

Representative Adam Smith described continuing challenges on the matter in a press briefing on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, where he’s leading the [first](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/china-hosts-us-house-group-as-tiktok-trade-talks-gain-momentum) official visit by US House lawmakers since 2019 as relations steady before a [potential meeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/xi-asks-trump-to-avoid-taking-restrictive-trade-measures-in-call) between the countries’ presidents.

**“I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question,” Smith said, without specifying what the sticking points are. “I think that that still needs to be worked on.”**

China dominates the global supply and processing of the minerals, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. Beijing has used its position as a [strategic lever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/china-deploys-rare-earths-as-weapon-in-trade-war-with-trump) as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalated earlier this year.

The two governments reached a framework agreement in June that includes a [Chinese commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-27/china-says-it-confirms-trade-framework-details-with-us) to review applications for shipping rare earth magnets, although few details of the deal have been disclosed. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last week said supplies to his country had “bounced back up significantly,” although European companies have complained about [shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-rare-earth-product-exports-hit-highest-since-at-least-2012) that threaten to halt production.

Smith also struck a note of caution in response to a reporter’s question about whether Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. will have any role in maintaining the app’s algorithm in the US. Citing privacy and security concerns, he said the matter has “not been 100% resolved,” while adding that he wasn’t privy to the negotiations. 

The US and China are nearing an agreement to hive off the US operations of social media platform TikTok to a consortium that includes software giant Oracle Corp. Under the spin-off arrangement being discussed, TikTok will be majority-owned and controlled by Americans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Many of the finer details of the agreement have yet to be made public.

Joined by US Ambassador to China David Perdue, the delegation’s visit may build more goodwill ahead of a possible sitdown between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in South Korea. 

The world’s two largest economies are in the [final stages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/us-china-talks-for-huge-boeing-aircraft-order-in-final-stages) of negotiations for a “huge” Boeing Co. aircraft order, Perdue said at the briefing. Such a deal, which has been years in the making, would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two nations but has been contingent on an easing in tensions.

On the security front, Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged Beijing to engage in talks over its “rapidly growing nuclear arsenal” to prevent miscalculation. 

“When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation about it to make sure that we understand each other,” Smith said. He stressed the need for better military-to-military dialogue, a message he delivered in meetings with Chinese officials including Premier Li Qiang since the delegation arrived on Sunday. 

During the trip, the US delegation has also discussed the flow of fentanyl and called for fair [access](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/us-lawmakers-call-for-more-defense-talks-in-rare-china-visit) to China’s market for US firms.

The group is scheduled to meet with National People’s Congress Chairman Zhao Leji and Foreign Minister Wang Yi later on Tuesday, Vice Premier He Lifeng said Monday.

* **Australian rare earths, graphite firms eye US expansion**
* **Large, developed customer base is key attraction**
* **Investors show interest in critical minerals projects, execs say**

MELBOURNE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Some of Australia's most advanced critical minerals producers are moving forward on plans to build processing facilities in the United States, despite Australia's strategic push to build up its own domestic industry. An Australian delegation of critical minerals companies visited Washington and New York last week to meet senior administration officials and investors. ASX-listed firms including Australian Strategic Materials [(ASM.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ASM.AX), Ionic Rare Earths [(IXR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IXR.AX), and International Graphite [(IG6.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IG6.AX) are looking to expand in the U.S., company executives told Reuters.

The scale of the U.S. customer base is a major attraction, they said, given its rapidly developing electric vehicle, defence, and advanced manufacturing industries, as well as cheap energy and the hefty subsidies it is set to deploy. ""We've identified six states as ones that we're looking at seriously,"" said Chief Legal Officer Annaliese Eames of ASM, which is seeking to expand beyond its rare earths metallization plant in Korea. Of those states, ASM, an $85 million firm, is conducting detailed due diligence, including reviewing sites, in Oklahoma and South Carolina. What drew ASM to the U.S. was more than strong federal and state support and incentives. ""It's the commitment that they're making to grow the entire ecosystem,"" she said.

Some critical minerals firms that supply to customers in defense need to locate nearby for reasons of national security and the series of complex steps in turning raw materials into magnets used in everything from wind power to missiles. That is the case for Ionic Rare Earths, which is planning to replicate the magnet recycling technology it has developed in Belfast in several U.S. states, including Tennessee, where it is in advanced discussions, Managing Director Tim Harrison said. ""There are a number of other states that can provide very low cost of power... They also have a lower labor cost base and they have both federal and state governments that are willing to deploy immense funding,"" he told [Reuters.International](http://Reuters.International) Graphite, which is building an advanced processing plant in Western Australia, is also looking at options to build in the U.S. and Europe, to be more closely aligned to the specific requirements of its customers, CEO Andrew Worland said. China's restrictions on rare earths exports [in April](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) galvanized the U.S. to supercharge its rare earths industry, and higher Western world prices that have emerged are attracting investors and greasing the wheels of project finance. Even so, acess to U.S. funding is expected to be highly competitive. Australia's Lynas Rare Earths [(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), the biggest supplier outside China, warned last month that its heavy rare-earths processing plant in Texas may not go ahead after the Trump administration provided multibillion dollar funding to its U.S. rival.

# POLICY CHALLENGES

The trend highlights critical policy challenges in Australia that are impeding the government's ambition to develop new export markets beyond its mainstay fossil fuels. That opportunity was worth A$170 billion ($112 billion) to its economy by 2040, according to a PwC report as recently as 2023.""Australia has been struggling to set up the critical minerals industry beyond primary extraction,"" PwC Australia chief economist Amy Lomas said. Australia's high power and labor costs, and a cumbersome approvals process, are dragging on growth and diminishing the country's international competitiveness, major miners regularly [complain](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bhp-flags-organic-copper-growth-us-allure-silent-big-buyouts-2025-09-15/). Meanwhile, advanced manufacturing is still a small sector, its development clipped by the closure of Australia's car industry in the 2010s.""For an Australian company to look at building it in Australia, where do we sell our materials? Where is the metals, alloys, magnet capacity being built? It’s not being built in Australia because our cost base is too expensive and we have minimal advanced manufacturing industry,"" Ionic's Harrison said. Still, Australia passed a A$17 billion production tax credit in February that will provide a 10% offset for critical minerals processors from 2027. It is also building critical minerals partnerships with allies including Japan, India and Britain that could deepen its customer base, PwC's Lomas added. ""Then that starts to set the foundations for Australia to be able to run a lot harder typically for midstream processing, and then ideally downstream processing,"" she said.

**American Rare Earths (** [**(AU:ARR)**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:arr?utm_source=msn.com&amp;utm_medium=referral) **) just unveiled an announcement.**

American Rare Earths has completed test mining and primary crushing of approximately 3,080 tonnes of rare earth ore at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek deposit. The company is conducting comminution optimization tests on 13.7 tonnes of ore samples to improve rare earth magnet element recoveries and project economics. The remaining ore will be used as feedstock for a demonstration plant, which will validate processing methods and support future technical studies. These efforts are expected to enhance the company’s position in the domestic permanent magnet industry and increase stakeholder confidence.

# SEPT. 22nd, 2025~US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto

[US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto](https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/28947/us-buys-scandium-oxide-from-rio-tinto/)

https://preview.redd.it/v2wsy6wlxvqf1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44f8a5f123757f6819aa59df812be17fbe3b19b

**The Logistics Agency of the US Ministry of Defense (DLA) plans to buy scandium oxide worth up to 40 million dollars from a branch of the mining company Rio Tinto in the next five years.** The goal is to replenish strategic stocks for military and technological needs. Scandium is one of the rare earth minerals, and its role in military devices and advanced technology is crucial. Currently, the largest producer is China, which has introduced strict export controls.

""Until recently, we sourced scandium primarily from China. In late 2024, China introduced scandium export controls that limited the supply chain and prompted us to purchase for National Defense supplies,"" according to a DLA document released last week. 

**The plan is to buy a total of 6.4 tons of scandium oxide in the next five years, which in the first year amounts to almost two tons or about five percent of last year's total global production. Last year, according to the data of the American Geological Survey, 40 tons of scandium oxide were produced, with a total capacity of 80 tons.**

**In order to encourage domestic production, the US in August granted $10 million to Elk Creek Resources, an arm of the mining company NioCorp Developments, which plans to produce scandium in Nebraska. Until then, America had to import metal from abroad, and Rio Tinto was the only seller capable of meeting the state's needs in the required quantities.**

The management of the British-Australian company refused to comment on business details, **but it was pointed out that it is ""actively working with the US government to explore opportunities and take advantage of government support for greater domestic production and stabilization of the supply chain"".** In 2020, Rio Tinto researchers developed a process to extract high-purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production.

The company in Quebec, Canada, has been producing scandium oxide for three years, and the current capacity is three tons per year. ""Rio Tinto is in a unique position and can help supply materials critical to America's future,"" management told Reuters.

# 📌 DFARS, Defense Primes &amp; Scandium: Why the Timing Matters

The Reuters scoop (Sept. 22) confirms the Defense Logistics Agency just opened a $40M, 5-year scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto to shore up the National Defense Stockpile. **But even more important — it explicitly cites the $10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp) in August to accelerate domestic scandium production.**

**Here’s why it matters: under DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a stopgap, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement are slated for November.**

# IMHO~The Bottom Line:

# The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) just paid a contract price of $6,250/kg!— a strong benchmark for federal price support.*

**This pricing level is especially significant for NioCorp, which received a $10 million U.S. award in August to accelerate domestic scandium production. Unlike other suppliers, NioCorp plans to vertically integrate: producing scandium oxide, refining it into metal, and alloying it into Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloys —** the form required by defense and aerospace primes under DFARS regulations. That integrated pathway allows NioCorp to potentially capture a similar material pricing (\~$6,250/kg) but also additional alloy-level premiums moving forward.

**In short, the DLA contract sets a price floor, confirms real demand, and validates the economics behind NioCorp’s business model. With federal buyers already valuing scandium this highly and policy driving secure domestic sourcing, NioCorp’s mine-to-alloy strategy is aligned perfectly to meet DFARS-compliant defense demand!**

# The Setup Before the Strike

Tomorrow kicks off NioCorp’s biggest showcase week in years: the **RedChip investor presentation at 4:15 PM EST (Sept. 24)** followed by **Mark Smith live with Maria Bartiromo at 7:30 AM EST (Sept. 25)**. That sequence is deliberate — first, Wall Street and institutions get the technical roadmap, then the very next morning the retail base and national audience hear the story on Fox Business. It’s a one-two punch engineered to maximize visibility.

But the real kicker dropped this week: **Reuters confirmed that the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency just awarded Rio Tinto a $40M scandium oxide contract (6.4 tonnes over five years)**, paying the equivalent of **\~$6,250/kg Sc₂O₃** (≈$9,600/kg scandium metal-equivalent). **That sets a** ***price floor*** **for Scandium in defense supply chains —** and with NioCorp potentially funded to advance utilities and site prep, **and with Mark Smith openly teasing Scandium alloy partnerships and November announcements, the timing could not be sharper.** Elk Creek is positioned to be **the only U.S. upstream source of Scandium** at scale, meaning the DLA’s stopgap with Rio Tinto is just that — a bridge until domestic supply comes online.

Put together, the picture is clear: **Phase 1 drilling complete with assays due mid-October, Scandium alloy breakthroughs lined up for November, and a Q4 DFS that folds in all upside just as EXIM/DFC financing comes to a head.** Against a backdrop of new federal critical mineral funding and active Pentagon stockpiling, NioCorp isn’t just a niobium play anymore — it’s becoming the cornerstone of a **North American multi-metal critical minerals complex.** Translation: the table is set, the catalysts are stacked, and starting tomorrow, the ignition sequence begins.

🚀 **Bottom line:** **Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine.” It’s shaping into the U.S. Resource Independence Keystone — Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths all under one roof.**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2029 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

Rodom sam iz Srebrenice. Retko dolazim, ali kad i dođem, uvek odem do Gubera (nekadašnjeg lokaliteta banje Guber). To je pravo čudo prirode: zemljište je obogaćeno kojekakvim rudama (izvinite, ne znam pravi izraz za to), vode koje protiču kroz samu banju su lekovite zbog tih ruda, sama korita/izvorišta su crvene boje, vazduh je neverovatno kvalitetan, itd itd.

E pa, danas sam otišla do gore, i čuvena očna voda jedva kaplje. Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto.

Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište.

Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga?

Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi.

1nitbru,Homicídio 71 - Tio do homicida de Josué 'Boxista' morto a tiro em Rio Tinto,lll1572002,6,0,"[https://www.cmjornal.pt/portugal/detalhe/tio-do-homicida-de-josue-boxista-morto-a-tiro-em-rio-tinto](https://www.cmjornal.pt/portugal/detalhe/tio-do-homicida-de-josue-boxista-morto-a-tiro-em-rio-tinto)

&gt;Valquírio, o tio do homem que matou Josué 'Boxista', na madrugada de 4 de maio, durante uma rixa no exterior de um bar, na Rua Escura, no Porto, foi morto com três tiros ao início da tarde desta terça-feira, em Rio Tinto, Gondomar.

&gt;O homicídio aconteceu num posto de combustível, perto do quartel dos Bombeiros da Areosa, quando Valquírio se encontrava dentro do carro. No local, esteve um forte aparato policial, elementos dos bombeiros de Rio Tinto e do INEM.

&gt;As autoridades acreditam que o crime possa tratar-se de um ajuste de contas.

&gt;Recorde-se de que, na madrugada de 4 de maio, Josué Maia, conhecido por 'Boxista', de 24 anos, ter-se-á desentendido com algumas pessoas no local e acabou por desferir um murro a Valquírio, tio de Daniel 'Cenoura'. Por vingança pela agressão ao tio, 'Cenoura' sacou de uma arma de fogo, já no exterior do bar, e atingiu Josué a tiro no tórax, junto ao braço esquerdo.

1mgkh7y,"Well, I got robbed in Rio (lol)",No_Spell_9356,77,105,"I’m Puerto Rican and have been traveling through Brazil with my boyfriend (he’s Peruvian) for the past three weeks. We’re not clueless gringos (although I guess we are lol), we’ve been cautious the whole trip. But yesterday, for the first time, I asked him to take a photo of me in Santa Teresa. We had been there before and felt safe, asked locals and they said it was pretty safe as well.

Out of nowhere, a guy on a motorcycle pulled up, took out a gun, and demanded the phone. We handed it over. It sucks, but whatever, I can get a new phone. What’s worrying me more is my data.

I marked it as lost through Apple (although I made a mistake and marked the wrong device at first and only realized today), now it’s locked and erased. But due to that mistake, they had a whole day where I didn't mark it as lost through apple (which should I ideally turn it into an expensive brick that you can't use).

**My questions for people who know how this works in Brazil:**

* What usually happens to stolen phones here?
* Can they access your data even if it’s locked with Face ID and a passcode?
* Do people here typically hack into phones, or do they just wipe and resell them?
* Is there anything else I should do to protect myself right now?

Any insight would be really appreciated. Obrigada!

  
**Edit:** 

This was during the day, like 3 pm ish. I don't know exactly where it was, but we were by a coffee shop that is going down a hill with a beautiful view, there was a cool wall if you went a little farther down and I asked my boyfriend to take a picture there. It was on the sidewalk but the sidewalk was full of cars so I'm not even sure how he got into the sidewalk with his motorcycle. There were people up on the coffee shop but not too many where we were. There was a couple around who threw their stuff under a car and ran, lol. They later told us that the main area is safe but when you go a little farther down it gets sketchy.

1ndpbb3,Why do foreigners romanticize Rio de Janeiro so much?,Square-Upstairs1816,1586,690,"I’ve noticed that many foreigners, especially Europeans, tend to romanticize Rio de Janeiro a lot. Many dream of living there, even though most Brazilians themselves wouldn’t necessarily choose Rio as their ideal place to live.

It almost feels like a “Paris effect,” where the city’s global image sometimes overshadows its realities. But unlike Paris, Rio doesn’t really hide its contradictions, beauty and problems exist side by side.

What’s also interesting is that Brazil has been breaking records in international tourism lately. According to recent data, Rio alone saw a 51% increase in foreign visitors compared to last year. The city’s international appeal seems stronger than ever, even though locals often see it with more caution.

Even among my own European friends, I’ve noticed a shift: instead of planning a Eurotrip or the classic “European summer,” many now dream of spending their summer in Rio, treating it like their own version of a “Euro summer.” Honestly, I find this surprising.


Why do you think foreigners romanticize Rio so much?

Is it the beaches, the Carnival, the landscapes, or the “myth” of Brazilian lifestyle?

1mxyol7,We tried to skip the cable car line in Rio… ended up needing rescue,carlosrudriguez,2357,172,"There are things one thinks, “that will never happen to me.” For example: I’ll never be left abandoned at sea, adrift; I’ll never be shipwrecked on a deserted island; or I’ll never get lost in the forest. Especially with that last one, whenever I saw in a movie or TV show that someone got lost in the woods, I always thought that could never happen to me. I have a good sense of direction, I consider myself capable, I simply didn’t understand how someone couldn’t retrace their steps back to the starting point. Well, that overconfidence landed me in one of those situations I thought would never happen to me: getting lost in a forest. Well, not exactly a forest, it was the Morro da Urca, a hill in Rio de Janeiro right next to one of the city’s most famous peaks, Sugarloaf Mountain. It was a short but terrible experience that left me with a good story to tell and feeling a bit humiliated. To explain what happened, I need to start with how the day began.

It was a Thursday, and my wife and I decided to visit Sugarloaf Mountain, which is a hill on the bay of Rio de Janeiro. The way to get there is by cable car from the Bondinho Park. From there, the cable car takes you to the first station on Morro da Urca, a smaller hill right next to Sugarloaf. At the top of that hill, there’s a restaurant, some shops, and the next cable car station that takes you up to Sugarloaf itself. We did the whole tour, walking through the viewpoints, taking pictures, and having a good day. By sunset, we came down from Sugarloaf to Morro da Urca (the first hill) for an event they host on certain days, where a DJ mixes dance music as the sun goes down. The event lasted till about 6:00 p.m., when it was already dark. Both hills and the park close at 8:00 p.m.

Suddenly, everyone wanted to go down on the cable cars, and the line was massive. My wife and I decided to wait a while, having a couple of beers while the line shrank. But an hour later, it was even longer. I estimated, without exaggerating, that standing in line would take nearly two hours. Another 30 minutes passed, and the line seemed to have grown even more. We couldn’t believe so many people were still trying to go down. Then we noticed a group of about six people heading toward a trail to go down. Turns out there’s a hiking trail down the hill. At the moment, it seemed like a good idea. I thought we could skip the line and be at the bottom in 20–30 minutes, it would even be a small adventure. Big mistake.

I asked the guard at the trail exit, and he said we had to go to an office and sign a liability waiver, releasing the park from any responsibility if something happened to us on the trail. Of course, what could happen? We signed it, came back, and by then there was no one else going that way. My wife and I were the only ones. The guard calmly led us to the gate, opened it, we walked through, he wished us good night, closed the gate behind us, and left. I have to say, the casual attitude of everyone, the waiver office lady, the guard, fed my confidence that this would be an easy walk down. I’ve hiked other trails before, and while some are tiring, they’ve never been a big deal. So between my usual overconfidence and the staff’s attitude, I thought, “No problem. In 20 minutes we’ll be down, and it’ll have been a mini adventure.” I turned on my iPhone flashlight since the trail was completely dark, and off we went.

Well, the trail kept getting narrower and steeper until we reached a point where I wasn’t sure we were even on the trail anymore. After trying to continue in a few different directions, it was clear we were no longer on the right path, maybe 20 minutes had passed. We decided to retrace our steps back to the park entrance, and that’s when the fear of feeling lost began, because going back, we couldn’t find the starting point. It seems impossible, and whoever reads this might think we’re idiots, but really, several factors contribute to getting you disoriented. It wasn’t our first time hiking, but it’s shocking how quickly we got lost. After a while of not being able to find the entrance, I told my wife our only option was to try to go down somehow, no matter what.

By then I was getting really nervous because the park must have been closing, and we couldn’t hear any noise in the distance. My phone had about 25% battery, my wife’s only 5%. Just like in a movie. What followed were about two hours of false trails, arguing among ourselves in the darkness: “It’s this way!” “No, it’s that way!” “We came from there!” “No, we didn’t!” “We already passed this log.” “No, we didn’t.” Every tree looked the same, every trunk the same, every plant the same. The vegetation was dense, we couldn’t see the moon, we couldn’t see city lights because of the dense vegetation, the terrain was steep, everything was slanted —it’s a hill after all— and we only had an iPhone flashlight.

“This can’t be,” I thought. “We can’t be lost. We’re in a city, not a real forest. Civilization is only 600 or 700 meters away. (About 2,000–2,300 feet)” And for those who know Morro da Urca or at least have seen pictures, you might say, “It’s just a hill, how could you get lost there?” Well, it’s not a small hill. From a distance it looks small, but in reality, it’s quite large. I couldn’t find the exact surface area of Morro da Urca, but together with Sugarloaf, they cover 91.5 hectares (roughly 226 acres). Morro da Urca is 220 meters high (about 720 feet), and the trail, I googled later —idiot—, is 1.5 kilometers long (just under a mile), but normally takes about 45 to 60 minutes. So it’s not like getting lost on a tiny hill.

[The small buildings at the bottom of this illustration are around 7 to 8 stories high. This pic won't show the dimension but gives you a slight idea of the geography there.](https://preview.redd.it/la5g8v2j4rkf1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50d3ce9a5826d4701ddbb77a6f08b0cc08f8c405)

You might also think: “It’s a hill, just walk in any direction until you reach the bottom.” Logical, right? Except that when we tried, all we found were cliffs, ravines, or vegetation so dense we couldn’t pass. A fun fact I discovered: the hill is full of thorny plants… and I was wearing shorts. We reached a point where we couldn’t go any further, every path seemed harder, it was pitch dark, the phone batteries were running low, and reality set in: yes, we were lost. Yes, we needed to be rescued somehow.

[One would think it's just a trail down a hill, well it's not that small of a hill nor a trail.](https://preview.redd.it/clvq8z6d5rkf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a739288f4c8421df19448a29d4c063473eaa7e4)

My wife had the very obvious idea—which hadn’t even occurred to me—of shouting for help. In Spanish (we’re Mexican), in English, in Portuguese, she shouted at the top of her lungs. Reflecting on that later, I realized why I hadn’t thought of it: I think men are programmed to believe we don’t need help, that we can always get ourselves out of any situation. A very stupid way of thinking, but deeply ingrained. I told my wife I was going to call emergency services since my phone still had some battery. I was reluctant to doing it before because it felt humiliating but also because I thought somehow we were going to set a whole thing in motion that would probably cost us money. I could picture the morning news story: “Two stupid Mexican tourists had to be rescued from Morro da Urca last night”. I called, a recording said, “For English, press star.” I pressed star. Someone answered in Portuguese. I asked if they spoke English or Spanish, no, they didn’t. With my terrible Portuguese, I tried to explain. Out of frustration, I spoke very slowly in Spanish, hoping they would understand. I said we were lost on Morro da Urca and asked if they could alert a park ranger. “Wait a moment,” they said, and put me on hold for a few minutes. I don’t think they understood. Meanwhile, my wife kept shouting, and then we heard a shout from up the hill. She shouted again, another reply. “They found us!” my wife said. “Hang up!” I did.

After shouting back and forth, we saw a flashlight from above. “Você pode me ver?” I asked in Portuguese (Can you see me?). “Sim, vejo!” they replied (Yes, I see you). More voices above. At least now we knew the park staff knew we were there. They shouted for us to go right. “Sua direita ou minha“ (Your right or mine?) I asked. They signaled with the flashlight, far away but visible. We started moving in that direction, constantly shouting so they could track our position. A few minutes later, we heard voices closer, at our level. We shouted, they shouted back. I had never felt so vulnerable yet so relieved to know help was coming. Finally, we saw the flashlight beam pointing at us. “Here!” we shouted waving our arms, like castaways spotting a rescue helicopter. When they reached us, My wife looked at me as if to say, “Holy crap, we made it!” I laugh now when I think about it.

At last, we were found: three park workers with flashlights, one with a rope. They asked if we were okay, if we had any injuries. They led us back, about 10 minutes walking, to the spot we had started from. Pavement, civilization. Out of that green hell that, under the iPhone light, looked more black-and-white. They offered us water. I hadn’t noticed how sweaty and thirsty I was. We must have looked ridiculous, with our tourist clothes, a tote bag from a Danish museum and iPhones. Just a couple of dumb tourists who tried the trail and got lost.

We had been lost about three hours, but it felt like six or seven. When I checked the time, I couldn’t believe it had been so short. Darkness, disorientation, and fear stretch time. They said they’d take us to a cable car to go down. My wife asked if there was any dangerous wildlife on the hill. “Only snakes” they replied.

Normally there are two big enclosed cable cars on service, that hold 65 people each, but the workers use a small open one, like a metal basket. We got on that one with them and began the descent. “Nobody else gets to ride this,” I thought. “At least I got a VIP trip.” While descending I looked back at the hill, it was much bigger than the picture I had in my mind, all cliffs around. “Lucky we didn’t fall off one,” I thought.

I asked the workers if we were the first ones to get lost. “No.” One asked where we were from. I told them. Representing Mexico. We reached the bottom, they led us out, we said goodbye and thanked them profusely. We walked onto the street as if nothing had happened, hard to believe just minutes earlier we had been contemplating spending the night on the hill, waiting for daylight. We walked about 200 meters (around 650 feet) to call an Uber. I looked back, and the park staff were still there, waving goodbye. I waved back. Five minutes later, we were in an Uber on the way to our flat, with a few scratches and cuts, but laughing.",2025/8/23 21:12,,Security Incident,"{""Security Incident"": ""negative""}",0.6,"{""Security Incident"": ""Um Policial Tirando um cara do telhado de um Mercado""}",Reddit

1n8yai2,Streak 1508: Las minas de Riotinto,logrono,2,2,"Ayer visitamos las minas de Riotinto. Me había parecido muy interesante cuando lo había encontrado en internet, así que madrugamos y conducimos una hora y media para llegar con tiempo y así poder verlo todo. 

No obstante, no creo que valiera la pena. Es decir, había unas vistas espectaculares, pero el resto de las actividades turísticas nos decepcionaron. O eran muy cortas, o no mostraron nada. 

Lo que debería haber sido el punto álgido de la visita, el tren, fue bastante incómodo y demasiado largo. Duró una hora y media y como fue un recorrido de ida y vuelta, empezamos a aburrirnos un poco. 

Es una pena, porque sí que me había parecido interesante. Creo que vamos a visitar las minas de Almadén también, espero que ahí la visita sea más interesante.
