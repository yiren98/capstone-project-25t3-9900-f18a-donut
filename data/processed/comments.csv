1,njrq3g1,t3_1o7zuj7,1o7zuj7,flimsypantaloon,"A spokesman for the traditional owners was interviewed on the ABC, those cost may be around $250M. They don't want steel as it will rust. 

It's super remote and the chap said it is not planned to open it up as a tourist site  and that it will be only for local traditional owners to visit.

I find it interesting that they want hundreds of tons of epoxy resin installed out in the virgin wilderness where it will inevitably decay to become microplastics. 

Wouldn't $250M be better spent on health or education? Seems like a no brainer.

You obviously seek the sources- a large part of lithium mining today even is all about finding groundwater brines and mineral springs that contain heavy amounts in the water. So we’d be Piping from underwater vents and such. Obviously not just dropping a tube in the ocean and processing what you get- that’s insane. Like digging your back yard dirt and relying on that for lithium. What a non-argument lol

The great salt lake contains 60 mg/l, for example, lots of hot springs in Japan have been reported with large quantities, the Dead Sea, mineral springs and groundwater brine outlets into the ocean would be a safer target than digging up the ground next to them, and anything on the ocean or near the ocean has perpetual wave energy available and higher wind and solar potential to greatly alleviate grid pull. It would be foolish to calculate the cost as completely taken from a fossil fuel grid- it’s on the ocean, ffs

&gt; Belgrade - Hundreds of environmental protesters blocked roads in Belgrade and other Serbian towns on Saturday, angered at mining giant Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s plans to extract lithium in the Balkan nation.

&gt; &amp;quot;I am here because I don&amp;#039;t want them to sell off the land of my ancestors. Serbia is not for sale,&amp;quot; one of the protesters, Milan Milosavljevic, a 31-year-old musician, told AFP. Protesters also blocked roads in several other Serbian towns, including Novi Sad in the north, central Kragujevac, Sabac in the northwest and the western town of Valjevo, according to the N1 television channel.

&gt; The company intends to invest $2.4 billion in the project, according to Vesna Prodanovic, director of Rio Sava, Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s sister company in Serbia.
