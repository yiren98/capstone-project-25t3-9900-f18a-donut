One walk around the offices shows moroseness, heads down, scared looking, and staring blankly ahead. Nobody says greetings like ""good morning"" or ""hello."" It is horrible. Read the other reviews on Glassdoor. In order of worst Cons: 1. Seems to be that employees are the ""enemy"" and they are frequently undermined. No pun intended. 2. Salary - Initially, salary seemed pretty good, but company has a habit of unilaterally cutting base salaries and benefits whenever possible, sometimes up to 30% or more. This can be a blanket ""removal of allowances"" or a restructure of the bonus calculation - all with the aim of reducing salaries paid to employees. Similarly, almost any time a role is refilled, the ""banding"" or salary range will be downgraded so that the incoming replacement is shorted some compensation. Similarly, roles often get combined or off-shored so have to do more for less 3. It is an ""old boys network"" in the classic sense. In order to keep this lucrative musical chairs going lower downs may be undercut and outsiders never brought in. 4. Backstabbing - Setting up for failure or simply not supporting are common practice in my experience, it is the accepted way of work here. It is remarkable that anything actually gets done (not much does) due to the constant plotting and restructuring and empire-building that goes on. 5. Ego - Rio Tinto thinks of itself as the greatest company in the world: ""We aren't a mining company, we are a tech company ""... Well, certainly suppliers and customers laugh at that. The company doesn't want fresh or innovative ideas despite paying lip-service to this. 6. Diversity and Inclusion - Or, lack of. 7. No training or development budgets. This was always hidden from employers and only recently was essentially taken away. Training or development must come from departmental budgets and hence ... not supported. 7. Double-speak: Rio are masters of ""saying one thing, yet doing another."" One has to read between the lines for almost all internal communications to understand the real meaning or intent. Up is down, black is white and night is day in the Rio Tinto world. For example, the recent revision of the bonus calculation method was ""not a cost reduction exercise"" but rather a ""positive revision to make the system simpler."" Oh, but the fact that many will get lower bonuses well, that is just a coincidence. [Sarcasm intended.]",negative,Recognition|Respect|Collaboration|Leadership|Inclusion|Belonging
