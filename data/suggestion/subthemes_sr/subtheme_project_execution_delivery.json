    "Execution"
  ],
  "overview": "This subtheme captures how the company delivers on its projects and commitments, reflecting its operational reliability and follow-through. It matters because consistent execution directly impacts stakeholder trust, resource efficiency, and long-term project viability, while failures can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal challenges.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Projects are evaluated based on their alignment with strategic goals and resource availability",
    "Stakeholders highlight both successful project deliveries and significant delays or cancellations",
    "Mention of specific, named projects (e.g., 'Jadar', 'West Angelas hub') as examples of work done or not done",
    "External certifications or permits (e.g., 'licences') are cited as factors influencing execution"
  ],
  "sentiment_snapshot": {

  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments often arise in response to official company announcements about project milestones, delays, or terminations.",
    "They are also triggered by external events that impact the company's operations, such as government decisions or activist campaigns.",
    "They frequently connect to broader discussions about corporate responsibility, governance, and strategic direction, not just the project itself."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Polarized stakeholder perception: The equal split in sentiment indicates deep divisions, where the company may be seen as both a responsible operator and an unreliable partner, depending on the stakeholder group. This erodes universal trust.",
    "Over-reliance on external validation: The positive mentions often cite external certifications (e.g., 'access to year-round work') or partnerships (e.g., 'Rio Tinto said...'), suggesting an over-dependence on external actors for validation of successful execution.",
    "Failure to communicate the 'why': The negative comments focus on outcomes (e.g., 'revokes licences') but lack context on the causes. This indicates a blind spot in transparently communicating project setbacks, leading to speculation and mistrust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute a 'Transparency & Accountability' framework for major projects: This should include clear, public timelines, regular updates on milestones (even for delays), and a transparent ledger of lessons learned from both successes and failures.",
    "Develop a 'Stakeholder Impact' communication protocol: For every significant project, proactively and clearly communicate the 'why' behind decisions (e.g., why a project is paused, why a site was chosen) to all affected stakeholders, not just shareholders.",
    "Integrate 'Social License' metrics into project delivery KPIs: Beyond financial and technical metrics, formally track and report on the social acceptance and community impact of projects as a core part of execution success."
