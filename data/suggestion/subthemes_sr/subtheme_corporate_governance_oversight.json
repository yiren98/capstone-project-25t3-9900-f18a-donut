  "overview": "This subtheme captures how external stakeholders perceive and discuss the company's governance structures, decision-making transparency, and adherence to ethical standards. It matters because consistent negative sentiment indicates a crisis of confidence in the company's leadership and oversight mechanisms, which can directly impact investor trust, partner relations, and social license to operate.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "External critics and observers directly challenge the company's official narrative on specific decisions or governance failures",
    "Scrutiny focuses on specific high-stakes operational decisions (e.g., partnerships, project approvals) that are perceived as misaligned with stated values",
    "Allegations of insufficient oversight or due diligence in major corporate actions (e.g., M&A, partnerships)",
    "Perceived hypocrisy between public commitments (e.g., sustainability) and actual operational decisions"

  "sentiment_snapshot": {
    "positive": 5,
    "negative": 29,
    "average_confidence": 0.826
  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Criticism emerges in reaction to specific, high-profile company announcements or investigative reports that reveal potential governance failures",
    "Discourse is often tied to real-world negative outcomes (e.g., environmental incidents, financial losses, community impacts) that are attributed to governance failures",
    "It interacts with dimensions like 'Accountability' and 'Ethical Responsibility' by questioning who is responsible for outcomes and whether structures exist to hold them accountable"
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "A significant 'say-do' gap develops where external parties perceive company actions as contradicting its stated values, eroding trust",
    "Governance failures are often only addressed reactively after public criticism or scandals, rather than proactively",
    "External stakeholders (e.g., NGOs, local communities) have a more accurate read on governance risks than internal leadership does"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute transparent, third-party facilitated reviews of major strategic decisions (e.g., partnerships, projects) before and after execution to validate alignment with stated values",
    "Formalize and publicize the terms of reference and membership of all board-level committees (e.g., risk, sustainability) to demonstrate rigorous oversight",
    "Create and mandate a 'Governance & Transparency' annual public report that goes beyond financials to cover decision-making processes, stakeholder engagement, and ethical dilemmas faced"
