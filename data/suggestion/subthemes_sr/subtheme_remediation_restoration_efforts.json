  "overview": "This subtheme captures instances where a company undertakes active efforts to repair, restore, or remediate damage it has caused, whether environmental, cultural, or social. It represents a tangible, action-oriented response to past mistakes, moving beyond mere acknowledgment.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Public commitment to funding and conducting independent environmental impact assessments",
    "Funding or physically rebuilding destroyed cultural or historical sites as replicas",
    "Publicly releasing findings and documentation of past incidents",
    "Explicitly linking remediation actions to core ethical principles like integrity"
  ],

  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "This behavior is most visible following a significant public scandal, legal action, or investigative journalism that exposes the extent of the damage caused by the company.",
    "It often appears as a response to external pressure, where the company is compelled to 'do something' tangible to address the harm.",
    "It interacts with dimensions of Accountability and Ethical Responsibility by demonstrating that the company is willing to invest resources to make amends, but it is often a reactive, not proactive, strategy."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Remediation can be misinterpreted as a full resolution of the problem, potentially diverting attention from systemic change and deeper accountability.",
    "Restoration efforts, like building replicas, risk being seen as symbolic gestures that do not address the root causes or prevent future incidents.",
    "If not paired with transparent communication and independent oversight, remediation efforts can be seen as a PR tactic, further eroding trust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Integrate remediation and restoration as a core component of the ethical framework, not just a reactive measure. Make it a standard part of the project lifecycle.",
    "Ensure all restoration efforts are developed and validated in partnership with affected communities and experts, not unilaterally.",
    "Communicate the 'why' behind remediation efforts transparently. Highlight it as a step in a longer process of accountability, not as the final solution."
