  "typical_contexts": [
    "Discourse focuses on high-stakes legal battles, such as class action lawsuits alleging serious misconduct.",
    "Scrutiny arises from cases where the company is a defendant in cases with significant financial or reputational implications.",
    "Discussions often link these legal challenges to broader issues of corporate culture, like ethical standards and accountability mechanisms."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Significant reputation damage from repeated legal challenges, especially those involving ethical breaches like fraud or harassment.",
    "Perception that the company prioritizes financial settlements (e.g., settlements) over genuine cultural or systemic reform.",
    "Insufficient communication or transparency around legal issues leads to distrust among external stakeholders."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish and enforce a zero-tolerance policy for any form of harassment or fraud, with clear, transparent reporting mechanisms.",
    "Implement rigorous, independent oversight of compliance and ethics programs, not just legal compliance but cultural adherence.",
    "Proactively communicate the steps taken to address issues (e.g., governance changes, training) to rebuild trust, rather than letting legal cases speak for themselves."
