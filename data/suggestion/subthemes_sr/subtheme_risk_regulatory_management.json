    "Over-reliance on reactive measures rather than proactive risk forecasting and mitigation",
    "Insufficient transparency in risk communication, leading to stakeholder distrust and speculative criticism",

    "Establish a proactive, enterprise-wide risk assessment framework that integrates with strategic decision-making at all levels.",
    "Enhance transparency mechanisms for risk reporting and compliance, ensuring stakeholders are informed about risk postures and mitigation efforts.",
    "Cultivate a culture of accountability where risk ownership is clearly defined, and employees are empowered to report and address risks without fear of reprisal."
