  "key_patterns": [
    "Mentions of specific, high-profile partners (e.g., Rio Tinto, Hitachi, Mitsui) to signal credibility and scale",
    "Focus on logistical or operational benefits (e.g., 'year-round work', 'access to infrastructure')",
    "Emphasis on financial or strategic advantages (e.g., 'low dilution', 'funding for cleanup')",
    "Contrast between positive outcomes (funding, expansion) and negative outcomes (partnerships ending, public backlash)"

    "Incomplete disclosure of partnership terms or benefits, leading to speculation and mistrust in some stakeholder groups"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish a transparent and multi-stakeholder review process for selecting and managing joint venture partners, ensuring alignment with core values and long-term strategy",
    "Develop a communication strategy that proactively highlights partnership benefits and learnings, not just outcomes, to build trust",
    "Create a partnership 'exit strategy' or review mechanism to proactively address underperforming or high-risk collaborations, minimizing negative fallout"
