    "Skepticism of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives as performative",

    "Insufficient communication of ethical due diligence and compliance processes, leading to assumptions of negligence"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement and transparently communicate a robust, multi-tiered ethical sourcing and partnership policy that is consistently applied across all operations",
    "Establish a transparent, third-party-audited reporting system for ethical performance, including supply chain ethics and partnership impacts, to rebuild trust",
    "Proactively engage with critical stakeholders, including local communities and international watchdogs, to demonstrate commitment beyond compliance and address concerns before they escalate"
