    "Innovation"

  "overview": "This subtheme captures how stakeholders perceive the company's ability to innovate in its products and services. It is a direct indicator of market confidence and the perceived future-readiness of the company. In this case, the discourse is currently negative, suggesting stakeholders feel the company is failing to innovate effectively.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Comparisons to unflattering or suboptimal benchmarks (e.g., 'PsBattle: The Rio Tinto River')",
    "Focus on past failures or shortcomings rather than future potential",
    "Association of the company's offerings with something of poor quality or inauthenticity",
    "Lack of concrete examples of positive innovation"

    "negative": 1,
    "average_confidence": 0.7
  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Discourse appears in informal, public forums like social media and Reddit, where users feel free to offer blunt critiques.",
    "Criticism is often triggered by a specific, recent event or communication from the company that fails to meet expectations, such as a product launch or an earnings report.",
    "Negative sentiment on innovation is often linked to broader criticisms of company strategy, leadership, or resource allocation, indicating a systemic rather than isolated issue."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Risk of innovation efforts being perceived as inauthentic or incompetent, leading to a loss of stakeholder trust.",
    "Blindspot in failing to communicate innovation successes, allowing negative perceptions to dominate the narrative.",
    "Potential disconnect between R&D initiatives and public-facing communication, leading to misaligned expectations."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute transparent communication channels (e.g., innovation blogs, behind-the-scenes features) to showcase the process and progress of innovation, not just the end result.",
    "Establish formal feedback loops with key stakeholder groups to understand and address specific concerns about product and service innovation.",
    "Leadership to publicly champion and celebrate incremental innovation and learning-from-failure, to reset internal and external expectations."
