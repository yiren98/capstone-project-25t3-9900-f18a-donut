  "overview": "This subtheme captures how workplace policies and social environments directly impact employees' daily living conditions, dietary habits, and overall lifestyle well-being. It matters because it highlights the direct, often unintended, consequences of corporate decisions on personal life, from work-life balance to physical health.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Companies implementing cost-cutting measures that directly reduce employees' quality of life (e.g., reducing sick leave)",
    "Social events or workplace culture encouraging unhealthy habits (e.g., excessive alcohol consumption)",
    "Corporate decisions creating negative environmental conditions (e.g., noise, pollution) that impede healthy living",
    "Positive exchanges around shared food or recipes as a form of social bonding and support"

  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments arise when companies implement policy changes that negatively impact employees' work-life balance or health, such as reducing sick leave entitlements.",
    "Also appears in discussions of social events gone wrong, where company culture enables unhealthy behaviors like excessive drinking, leading to serious incidents.",
    "Positive mentions occur in more personal, community-based contexts, like colleagues sharing recipes and food tips as a form of low-stakes social support."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Ignoring the impact of 'lifestyle' policies (e.g., leave, benefits) can lead to significant employee discontent and turnover, as it directly affects well-being.",
    "Overlooking the role of social events and daily workplace culture in normalizing unhealthy behaviors (e.g., excessive drinking) creates long-term health and safety risks.",
    "Failing to recognize the value of positive, low-stakes social interactions (e.g., sharing food, recipes) as a means of building community and resilience, missing opportunities to improve culture."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Conduct a full audit of all people policies (e.g., leave, benefits, remote work) with a focus on their impact on daily lifestyle and health, not just cost.",
    "Establish clear, publicized guidelines on alcohol and social events to prevent health and safety incidents, and actively promote healthy alternatives.",
    "Create and support platforms (physical and digital) for employees to share positive, lifestyle-oriented content (e.g., recipes, wellness tips) to build community and offset negative policy changes."
