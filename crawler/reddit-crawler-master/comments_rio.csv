But they seem to be looking at diversifying their business into high demand metals and it seems like they cut dividend to fund growth initiatives which could pay off down the road. They have a low p/e and a higher dividend yield than SCHD and they are a profitable company. What am I missing?","1","2025-08-09T16:03:34","1","t1_n7qfh5e"

"7","n7savt8","1mlhvni","CostCompetitive3597","Your RidingDeath handle may be prophetic with this investment strategy?  Points: not smart risk management to only invest in a single stock.  A company in transition adds more risk. They are foreign based in the UK listed on the NYSE. The US has the toughest company financial reporting requirements of any country. Investing directly in any foreign company increases risk. FYI. Investing in an international fund that invests in foreign company stocks is less risky because of the professional investment management involved. The current yield is only 6.03%. There are lots of higher yielding domestic stock/funds with less risk. Hope my perspective helps. Good luck !","1","2025-08-10T01:02:04","0","t3_1mlhvni"

Mining is one area where Australian companies get to be world class bastards. About the nicest thing you can say about Rio Tinto is they weren't responsible for one of the biggest mining disasters in history at the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea. That was BHP.

Worked in iron ore mining years ago. New mine sites were opening all the time. “New deposits”not really something new. E.g greater brockman mines 2, then 4, then silver grass. Main Brockman Mine camp was huge. Hope downs 1 started, then 4 and i believe it has expanded further towards West Angelas mine.

Mines all over the Pilbara.

I'd heard that safety advisors were on 95-105 at the time with some on slightly more or slightly less (no safety advisor would've been making anymore than 120 base). Assuming (off nothing other than vibes) you'd just pair back ~30k off of K band to get to L. 

Again, anecdotally, Lab techs were one of the lowest paid RTIO jobs onsite ~65-80k base (granted this was a few years ago). 

Commute allowance was ~14-15k for 8/6 | 5/2 4/3, the function allowance was dependent on the contracted hours, effectively overtime. 30% on base for 8/6 and 37.5% on 5/2 4/3, averaged to a 40 hour week.

So that's a lot of words to say, 65-125k but Lab techs likely to be around the 75k mark, for a total salary of ~100-115k?

Despicable.

But expected nothing less from Rio Tinto.

Rio Tinto is widely regarded as [having the worst track record for human rights among mining companies.](https://www.corp-research.org/rio-tinto), and that's saying something.

 Interestingly enough, its also the biggest private mining company in the world.

Back in the 70’s ( damn, the 70’s were an especially crap time to be a poor exploited worker from the third world ), Rio Tinto bought up the [Rossing mine in Namibia](https://www.namibian.com.na/164043/archive-read/Why-Rio-Tinto-must-go), and used the funds to [bribe the apartheid government of South Africa, the government of SA would then in return allow Rio Tinto special access in the country to mine for diamonds.](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=623) 

Read the whole link to be blown away by corporate bullshit.

From straight up shooting random ass natives, to telling miners that poisonous chemicals would cause them ” no harm “, to firing those workers even remotely associated with worker’s unions.

You know, I could leave it at that, but then I’d be forgetting the time They [funded a civil war in Papua New Guinea for a mine then refusing to pay for the clean up of said mine.](http://www.smh.com.au/world/billiondollar-mess-a-major-disaster-the-people-do-not-deserve-to-have-20160817-gquzli.html)

Or for doing the [exact same in Indonesia.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091222033219/http://www.waronwant.org/attachments/Fanning%20the%20Flames.pdf)

Or for locking out [600 workers in a contract dispute.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mine-lockout/locked-out-rio-tinto-borax-miners-in-u-s-get-support-idUSTRE61O0CV20100225)

Weirdly enough, it’s won some awards for “ethical behaviour “, from an award group that no longer exists. An award that was sponsored by the also-known-for-their-ethical-behaviour Tate and Lyle.

This method of deflecting criticism by way of ” hey we can’t be bad, we just got this awesome prize for ethics ” is referred to as [” greenwashing. ”](https://archive.is/20130414123201/http://www.clientearth.org/media-briefing-rio-tintos-greenwash-challenged-in-first-big-test-of-uks-company-reporting-regulator)

This was a theft from all of us.  Every single human alive today lost something when this went down.

I don't want to downplay the rights of the aboriginals here.  This was their heritage more than anybody elses, but at 46,000 years old the site would have held clues to a period when humans were still very much in the process of becoming human.  The oldest (known) musical instrument is about that old.  Complex language probably showed up about 50,000 years ago.  Cultural, religious and other traits were still pretty closely related across the world at that point.

This site contained clues to a unified human past, to pieces of our history that pertain to everybody.  It wasn't just Aboriginal or Australian or Asian/Oceanian history that was lost.  It was *human* history.  

And now it's gone forever.  For fucking IRON.  Iron is literally everywhere.  But some sociopathic fuckhead decided that he can boost his quarterly earnings by .0002% with this fucking mine.

My plea to Australia is this:  Please take this CEO to the exact center of your country and leave him there with nothing.  Maybe a beer.  A *warm* beer.

EDIT:

On a side note, apparently Rio Tinto's iron mostly goes to China.  Because of course China is involved.  One more reason not to buy anything made in China.","6724","2020-05-28T10:25:41","1","t1_fs0zvty"

&gt; A sacred site in Western Australia that showed 46,000 years of continual occupation and provided a 4,000-year-old genetic link to present-day traditional owners has been destroyed in the expansion of an iron ore mine.

&gt; Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under WA&amp;#039;s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents.

&gt; One year after consent was granted, an archeological dig intended to salvage whatever could be saved discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in artefacts, including sacred objects.

So, I *duckduckit* and found out they are both named after the same thing

The ""Rio Tinto"" company started their mining functions near the river (rio) Tinto in Spain, which is the exact same river that passes through that Portuguese town, reason why it's also called Rio Tinto

**Edit**: As /u/john-1973 pointed out those are actually not the same rivers, seems like one runs in southern Spain (for which company is named for) while other runs in northern Portugal (which named the town). My mistake, sorry.","34","2020-05-27T04:50:23","0","t3_gqymm1"
"238","fryxwck","gqymm1","John-1973","I'm sorry, but you're not correct. There might be a Rio Tinto running through that town, but it is not the same river the Rio Tinto mining company is called after.

The origin of that river is in the Sierra Moreno mountain range in Andalusia and flows into the sea in Huelva after running it's course exclusively in Spain.
There is a small town called Minas de Rio Tinto which is called after the original Rio Tinto mine and the name of the river comes from iron an copper that leaks into the river after mining operations, that have been going on there for more than 5000 years, coloring it red.


The town also has a nice little mining museum I have visited during my stay in the Sierra de Aracena area. 

My main goal was to see the red river myself after reading an article in New Scientist.

The article was about the almost alien feeling landscape surrounding some parts of the river which was actually used by NASA or ESA (I don't recall) to test equipment and routines for astronauts for a possible visit to Mars.","2","2020-05-27T21:55:18","1","t1_frwcfdr"

But most of the rage is not directed in the right place, and there are plenty of keyboard warriors making offensive and bigoted comments without understanding the facts. 

Don’t go blaming the average Australian, or the average West Australian, or the average mine worker. This is not front page news until after the fact, and based on how it transpired there’s no way Rio Tinto’s intention would have become common knowledge until after it has occurred. It’s also been widely reported in Australian newspapers since so don’t go blaming Rupert Murdoch left wing media for some tin foil hat cover up. 

Don’t go blaming the conservative Federal Liberal government and ScoMo; the consent was granted under West Australian legislation. And you can’t blame the current WA Labor government either; the consent was given in 2013. 

Rio Tinto followed the law. What this is, is a failing of the process for granting consent to disturb a site with heritage value. Consent was given for Rio Tinto to undertake the blasting under the Aboriginal Heritage Act in 2013. In order to get that consent, Rio Tinto had to engage with the traditional owners, and before consent was given, an independent body provided advice to the government. However, after consent was given, further details of the significance of the heritage value of the site was uncovered when Rio Tinto went to collect artefacts identified during earlier heritage surveys. It’s a failing of the Act that once consent was given, it couldn’t be altered or revoked once new info came to light. The law is old and in need of reform - successive governments have recognised that and there is currently a review process on foot. 

If you want to blame anyone, blame the mining company that proceeded with blasting despite  having the new information which came to light after the consent was granted. 

The SMH published a good article here if anyone wants to learn more about the process before they start flaming the first person who comes to mind to blame - https://www.smh.com.au/national/blast-destroys-one-of-country-s-oldest-known-aboriginal-heritage-sites-20200526-p54wmt.html","5","2020-05-27T20:34:29","0","t3_gqymm1"

On the whole, that's the entire reason we can't just go for high-tech renewable energy stuff. We don't have the resources. We primarily need to reduce consumption and all that stuff, not just replace fossil fuels. 

But on a smaller scale. We need to take into account other things than pure economic profit when mining for minerals. What will happen when Rio Tinto don't get their way all the time is that stuff will become a bit more expensive, there are still ways to get the resources though, it's just not as profitable.

Social distancing has forced millions of people to leave the workforce.... the *non-essential* workforce. And the result is [record-breaking drops in air pollution.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/climate/coronavirus-usa-traffic.html)

The data will be coming in for a while, but it looks like the virus has accomplished in a few weeks what climate activists &amp; policymakers have failed to make progress on for decades. And all it took was telling everybody not to go to work.

Now ask yourself. If these jobs we've let go of are really so non-essential.... why *should* we force everyone back to work when this is all over? If we want to, we can distribute a basic income instead, let most people do what they like with their time, and just pay higher wages to the smaller % of people who *choose* to work.

The truth is we've already automated most of our key industries. There's no reason to chase full employment like we've been doing. Full employment *is* climate crisis; this whole time, we've been inventing unnecessary jobs, which wastes unnecessary resources, just to give people wages.... which are barely sufficient way.

If we raise basic income instead, we can make people as rich as technological productivity allows, within whatever upper limit of consumption we feel the environment can sustain.

This hasn't occurred to most people yet. Most people still assume ""full employment, with clean energy"" is the right goal. But what the climate really needs is *minimum* employment.","3","2020-04-10T07:07:46","0","t3_fxqijc"

A couple million years if I remember my geology correctly.

Imamo čitav serijal mitova o Kosovu, ciklusi narodnih pesama se ravnaju prema Kosovskom boju, velika većina novokomponovanih etno pesama su o Kosovu, SPC stalno spominje Kosovo, u novinama svakog dana, na televiziji svakog dana, doslovno vršimo indoktrinaciju Kosovom. 

Koji god desničar hoće da se nametne na političkoj sceni, organizuje tribinu o ugroženosti našeg stanovništva na Kosovu i Metohiji i o našim nacionalnim interesima. Ma nemoj? Nova informacija u 2024. godini. Doslovno su isprali i iscedili tu temu kao suvu drenovinu. Dovoljno je u određenoj meri dozirati narod da ne zaboravi i ne odustane od svoje zemlje, ali ovo ide do iznemoglosti.

Ovo govorim kao tradicionalista i konzervativac. Smešno je kad se neko nađe da zamera kako ne radimo dovoljno po tom pitanju i kako eto niko ne spominje Kosmet, kad on doslovno iskače iz frižidera svakog dana, nosi se na majicama, na bilbordima, muralima, na yt, svuda.","39","2024-07-28T08:01:26","0","t3_1edq87a"

Wyam is a word that is common across several of the local languages, and in all of them it means 'the sound of falling water on the rocks'. Lewis and Clark described it as ""a great emporium...where all the neighboring nations assemble,"" with a near-urban population density in the Spring; the people there traded goods from as far away as Alaska and the Mojave. Since its discovery by Europeans, it had been protected by numerous treaties all guaranteeing the Indigenous people the right to fish there forever. In the 1940s, people were still building wooden platforms out over the river and fishing with nets and spears, still gathering there to trade and celebrate the abundance of salmon. It was a unique geographical feature that fed the people of Oregon for more than ten thousand years. In 1952, they dammed the river, flooded the villages, and forever silenced the sound of water falling on the rocks.","40","2024-05-16T05:44:32","0","t3_1csj9qu"

A community member was clearly more familiar with the mining company and asked whether the coloration was due to modern mining practices. A question that may well have been primed by the use of the word ""toxic"" in the original post and contemporary news items. There was no need to cut them down for their lack of knowledge about the actual Rio Tinto. It wasn't a stupid question and this could have been a great opportunity to help someone expand their knowledge.

I think we need to be less quick to attack people when they genuinely don't know something or misunderstand. I've been wrong a load of times and I always appreciate when someone can just help me get on the right track without trying to make me feel shitty.

The difference, I think, is that in the rich Western democracies the corruption tends to be high-level and not visible to the general public. So you can generally go through your whole life without directly experiencing it. It tends to be rich mofos paying off high level people. Whereas in the poorer and more overtly corrupt nations, the corruption is more visible at the lower levels, with low level civil servants and cops openly soliciting bribes. Basically in the rich western democracies you're unlikely to have a low level bureaucrat (say a worker at a government office or a traffic cop) openly demand a small bribe from you.","13","2024-05-18T23:32:34","0","t3_1cuqods"

As a male, I've applied hundreds of times for company jobs after extensive contracting work in that specific mining industry, on half a dozen different mine sites operated by that company, and contract work in other mining industries.  

A former female coworker who just got her trade certification applied her first time, interview, job offer. Zero mining experience. And, at THE top choice mine for the fact you can see it from the city. Mine money, home every night. 

Granted, she is a very talented sparky and fully deserves that job, and will excel at it. 
She was a 4th year apprentice when I worked with her on a small shutdown job with a mostly journeyman crew. We all told her she needs to pursue mining as soon as she gets her ticket.

While my resume and work experience checks all of the boxes and then some for the actual job, there's a couple big boxes I can not check as male outside of the visible minority group. 

Heck, a former male coworker of mine applied for a company job in a different mining industry. We worked together over a number of years on multiple mine sites for this other company, and were working together again when he interviewed for a position. It was during covid, so video interview. 
He recorded the interview and showed me, asking how I think he did. 

The interview started with ""tell us a bit about yourself"" and he replies with ""uhhhh, my name is Bobby and I uhhh, like electrical"". The rest of the interview was of equal caliber. 
He got the job. A $60+/hr +OT job at that. 
Again, he is a very talented electrician, just horrible at interviewing haha. 
He was able to check the other most important box.","1","2024-12-13T15:09:17","1","t1_m1s5ns5"

The Rio Tinto area has been the source of approximately 5,000 years of ore mining, including copper, silver, gold, and other minerals and this could be the possible reason for the high level of acidity of the river. However, this deep reddish color of the Rio Tinto is maintained for an approximate length of 50kms, and after which the coloration starts to decline.","383","2021-05-03T10:25:12","0","t3_n3jpr0"

Worse too the new legislation is pretty much forcing Indigenous Australians to ‘compromise’ with mining companies but removing any chance of blocking mining all together 

&gt; But the National Native Title Council said the native title act (NTA) is flawed. It only gives traditional owners a six-month window in which they must negotiate with mining companies or face an outcome that allows mining to go ahead without any benefits to them.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/12/mining-industry-opposes-new-laws-for-aboriginal-heritage-sites-despite-juukan-gorge-failures

&gt; Native title lawyer Greg McIntyre said relying on the architecture of the native title system would only work if groups representing traditional owners – known as prescribed body corporates, or PBCs – received greater federal funding.
“What really needs to happen is to lift the status of Aboriginal heritage to where it at least has some equality with iron ore. Ultimately whatever agreements you have, the government, of either colour, is going to consider the billions of dollars or iron ore is worth more to them than Aboriginal heritage,” McIntyre said.

&gt;Agreements under between mining companies and native title holders are commonplace in the Pilbara. They are usually confidential and often contain a gag order preventing traditional owners from publicly objecting to any proposal by the mining company, in exchange for a promise to minimise damage, follow a heritage management plan with regular consultation.

&gt;Rio Tinto had such an agreement with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people when it blew up the 46,000-year-old rock shelter in Juukan Gorge in May. BHP has a similar agreement with the Banjima people, which prevented them from objecting to an application to destroy up to 40 sites despite telling an archeological advisor they would “suffer spiritual and physical harm if they are destroyed”.

&gt;” The Western Australian Treasury, of course, benefits from every additional tonne of iron ore that is exported from the state.”

Tragic story of most Indigenous people is they are ‘given’ their sacred sites or land until colonial governments discover there’s gold, a pipeline, a new building, logging or other wealth to me made and old agreements are ripped up or loopholed ‘legally’. In some places they don’t even bring lawyers they just move in and ignore any legal rights.

*****
&gt; Mining giant Rio Tinto stripped its CEO of US$3.5 million Monday after the company destroyed a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site to expand an iron ore mine in Australia.

&gt; The board-led review found Rio Tinto had obtained legal authority to blast the sites but doing so &amp;quot;Fell short of the standards and internal guidance that Rio Tinto sets for itself&amp;quot;.

&gt; Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said there had been &amp;quot;Numerous missed opportunities over almost a decade&amp;quot; and the company had failed to respect local communities and their heritage.

Can guarantee that we didnt ask for sick leave to be cut in the employee survey, we asked that they stopped using low personel numbers as an excuse to cancel employee development and training and prioritise profit and productivity, after they decided to make so many people redundant earlier in the year.

Yes there was a few cases of people taking the piss out of the system which puts pressure on the employees that show up every week. But the problem lies with their ability to manage those people or manage them out.

45 was too high to maintain, but 10 is too low. Due to flight scheduling if you are sick for 2 days you're usually forced to take 3 or 4 days leave. You or your kid have a specialist appointment on a friday? Costs 3 days leave as they won't fly you home and back up in the middle of a swing you have to stay home. God forbid you're fatigued after your 6th 12.5 hour nightshift shift in a row and don't think it's safe to drive in the pit, youre stuck in your camp, also costs you a sick day.

I'm all for an adjustment but applying a standard leave measure to a very non standard industry with limited accessibility to site a risky move, given how abysmal employee satisfaction scores were in the last peoples survey.","126","2025-08-07T16:30:52","0","t3_1mjs4ol"

My thoughts.  
People do abuse the system; it brings down team morale as it stops training from happening plus the added workload.  
  
However, last year I did use 30 sick days and quite easily.  
1x swing (8 days) off due to covid, was asked not to come to site with symptoms.  
2x swings off due to severe back muscle spasms and multiple visits to physiotherapy. This was inflamed due to ripping hard rock in a track dozer and was persuaded not to put it down as work related to avoid being recorded as an LTI.  
1x further 8-day swing on site with forced isolation in my room with the flu, people not in mining don't see this but even though on site, it's still a sick day.

With being over 30 recorded sick days, a meeting was setup with the operations manager, superintendent and myself where I was put on a health and wellbeing plan to avoid any further sick days being taken..","5","2025-08-07T21:29:09","0","t3_1mjs4ol"

Rio Tinto had gotten approval from the government to mine the area on the condition that it would make sure it collected and saved materials from the site.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*But artifacts salvaged from surveys done by a contractor that Rio Tinto hired were stored in bags in a rusted shipping container with holes in the roof that let water leak in.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“Bags were labeled, however this did not always correspond with their contents,” the submission said. Some of the artifacts were at first misplaced in the trash and then deliberately tossed away by Rio Tinto, according to the submission.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*“So little was the respect for either the state’s conditions, or for the cultural heritage that was destroyed on a massive scale, hundreds of Eastern Guruma cultural artefacts ended up in the bin,” the submission continues. “It is WGAC’s view that the accidental, and then deliberate, discarding and destruction of Eastern Guruma cultural material was never disclosed to the Eastern Guruma people. It is a secret that has been kept by \[Rio Tinto’s subsidiary\] and the government for some 25 years.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*While the government has standards in place for how mining companies like Rio Tinto need to go about handling and treating Aboriginal sites, there’s actually a separate piece of legislation in place just for this specific mine that insulates Rio Tinto from oversight and legal action from Aboriginal people. The WGAC said in its submission that that specific law needs to be reconsidered in light of its allegations.*","77","2021-06-26T02:51:57","0","t3_o7qyn7"

https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/biden-administration-says-oak-flat-land-swap-should-proceed-11558259

&gt; For years, two Australian mining companies, Rio Tinto and BHP, have sought to build a massive copper mine in Oak Flat, a region of the Tonto National Forest east of Phoenix that is considered sacred by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other regional Native American tribes. The proposal, which was approved by Congress in 2014, involves swapping 2,422 acres of federally protected forest land in that area for over 5,000 acres of private land and constructing a roughly mile-wide crater to extract copper deposits located underneath Oak Flat. Critics of the project argue that it will be an environmental disaster and decimate indigenous sacred sites.

&gt; For critics of the Oak Flat copper mine project, the latest arguments made by the Biden administration's attorneys amount to a slap in the face.

&gt;""We thought that when Biden was coming in that he would also see this as really hurtful,"" said Robin Silver, co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity. ""This is basically still Trump-speak.""","56","2021-06-26T04:26:14","0","t3_o7qyn7"

"1140","gw9ipw6","n0xi1r","ExploreMoreMysteries"," The Río Tinto is a river that rises in the Sierra Morena mountains of Andalusia, in southwestern Spain. What makes this river unique is its red and orange colour, which originate from its chemical composition that is extremely acidic and containing high levels of iron and heavy metals. The Rio Tinto area has been the source of approximately 5,000 years of ore mining, including copper, silver, gold, and other minerals and this could be the possible reason for the high level of acidity of the river. However, this deep reddish color of the Rio Tinto is maintained for an approximate length of 50kms, and after which the coloration starts to decline.

Anyone in the industry knows you have good camps bad camps and shit camps. I'm curious how many complaints come from the good ones as opposed to the recognised shit ones because the good camps normally attract better quality people. When you start working at the bad or shit camps that's where everyone that can't get into or stay at a good camp goes so it can go downhill quick, gathering the dregs who back each other up like chimps.

&gt;
&gt;It's alleged the video was found in the man's locker along with the stolen items.
&gt;
&gt;Ms Green said she had been told she was on the video and had noticed some of her underwear was missing.
&gt;
&gt;But when she spoke to her supervisor about the incident, she alleges she was shut down and later interrogated in an official meeting with two senior executives.
&gt;
&gt;""I sat down and wondered what was going to happen. Concerned, I said 'am I going to be sacked?'"" she said.
&gt;
&gt;""And they said 'well, it depends on the answers that you give' and they started to question me about who I'm having sex with.""
&gt;
&gt;She said she was shocked and later accused of rorting an employee awards system and falsifying log books.
&gt;
&gt;""The accusations are not true. I have an immaculate work record and I've never had an issue or even a written warning,"" she said.
&gt;
&gt;After complaining to the BHP Ethics and Investigations team in March this year, Ms Green claims she was later terminated.
&gt;
&gt;In May, she was allegedly offered compensation for the way she was dismissed, but only if she signed a non disclosure agreement (NDA).
&gt;
&gt;""BHP state office said if I signed it then they would clear my record and change it to say I resigned instead of being terminated,"" she said.
&gt;
&gt;""That clears their name and their history and makes out like I happily left of my own free will.""
&gt;
&gt;She refused, is now unemployed and is speaking out to encourage other women to come forward.

As someone who works in this field and works for one of the big companies, they are big on sexual harassment. I have seen blokes get the sack for the smallest of comments (one guy said to a female employee “be careful, that’s heavy” and her response was “what? Because I’m a female?”). And I’ve seen blokes who have said some stupid shit that deserved the sack and never work in mining again. 

I know the site I am at, we have double locks on doors, 24/7 security, a help number, a code word you can say to any camp employee if you’re in danger and much more. Same with on site we have education and a lot of support and all is taken very seriously. Sometimes too far. 

Unfortunately, mining camps/sites are big communities. You are always going to get shit people just like you would get in your local suburb regardless how many rules are in place. 

Most blokes are good out there on site for these big companies but you are always going to get dickheads. Just like the women who are there. Most are great but some are dicks. Some cause trouble, some put themselves in these shit situations (a girl who is mid 20s recently invited a few old guys in their 50s to the pool area for a swim while she wore a tiny G string bikini) and yes, she should be able to wear that without any issues but cmon now, surely common sense would kick in. 

My point is yes females should feel safe in mining. 100%. But you are going to get a few dickheads and they need to be held accountable and punished accordingly. Also, you need to be careful how you conduct yourself. Both males and females.","1","2024-12-12T11:37:06","0","t3_1hbl2xx"

If you're talking about fixing gender equality, the time frame to fix this is at least 1 generation. More likely 2 generations. 

The reason why is because you've got to fix it from the bottom up. 

So for example, if the ceo position is to have potential female candidates for ceo, the female needs to have worked in the industry for years doing all sorts of shit properly to move up as a potential candidate. 

Instead you get these arbitrary metrics and unqualifed people and all they do is just wreck things in the organisation. 

I used to work in a very heavily male dominated industry and colleagues would say it was fucked that the woman with no industry experience got that x manager position. All because she had the correct organs. Instead of a proper hire, it was more like a wrecking ball. The existing staff were not happy and she was being white anted as a result.

In a crew of 30, I saw 5 new female staff members come and go in less than 12 months. There were particular older men who would sit there during the day, at crib, down at the wet mess, and spend half the day having a go at these women. And cruel jokes played by the younger men both at the site proper, and back at their dongas.

When the woman had enough and left the table at less, or the space, it would be ""what did I say?"". And when she inevitably quit, it would be ""women can't hack it out here"". And since I would have been sitting there the entire time they were saying some really nasty shit to whichever woman dared to join the crew, directed at me would always be ""not you, of course"". Because I didn't stick my head out, as I was too worried that I would be next on their hit list. Just their not so subtle little reminder that that it would be me if I made waves. 

The key point was that they didn't do that to the blokes.  The worst one of them got was a ribbing when he decided not to drink water so he didn't have to get out of the cab to pee, and got so dehydrated he nearly put the bucket through a truck window. 

If they want to have targets until they can stamp out that kind of bullshit, let them have targets until things even out a bit. But they need to clamp down on the bullying behaviour at the same time, or things will never change.","10","2024-11-20T20:59:14","0","t3_1gvll5t"

Now maybe you might not always get the best applicants because of that (at first), but you should still be getting qualified applicants none the less. Once you get a field used to having more women in it, it moderates to their existence and becomes more tolerable for women but also encourages a pipeline of future woman to see it as a field worth working/studying towards.

There's a bit of thought behind this, more than it being a morally right thing to do in most cases. But generally it can be a short term hit, for a long term cultural shift that will yield more economic benefits down the line... It turns out having half your population also capable of participating in the economy, whom then pay more taxes, as much as possible is a good thing for the economy and society at large, who knew.

May be hit and miss depending on the field of course.

Hiring a random person for the sake of it would be a bad use of such targets, but I do wonder how often its exactly the case of a random being hired, or a woman who is also qualified being hired, but viewed as just being a random from assumption.

Also there is an unspoken aspect of feminism that gets glossed over, that it is in a lot of cases about retribution than empowerment or equality at all. Making up for interpreted hardships of the past and getting revenge from those hardships. To me this makes the argument for an ideology being respected, listened to or taken seriously in instances like this article talking about equality to be very hard to do as for a lot of women following the movement its about restricting men like they think they were restricted in the past.

&gt; Health professionals and resources executives are growing concerned crystalline methamphetamine, or ice, is becoming a ""drug of choice"" for miners intent on circumventing on-site testing.
&gt; 
&gt; Sources said some miners were using ice on their rostered days off because the drug can be eliminated by the body much faster than other recreational drugs such as cannabis.
&gt; 
&gt; A mining contractor who has predominantly worked a four-weeks-on, one-week-off roster in Western Australia told The Australian Financial Review he was aware of his workmates using ice.
&gt; 
&gt; ""There's a big ice epidemic that's going on because it is easy to get and faster to get out of your system than, say, marijuana,"" he said. ""You can come back to site and test clean.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I've never been around it personally but there definitely have been people on my job site that have used it, not while on site but on their days off.""
&gt; 
&gt; Australian Drug Foundation head of workplace services Phillip Collins said there was strong anecdotal evidence workers were using drugs they knew would circumvent mine-site tests, such as methamphetamine.
&gt;
&gt; ""What we are finding in various sectors, including the mining sector, with the introduction of drug testing, is employees are finding ways to get around testing and what we have seen as a result is a shift from one illicit drug to another illicit drug,"" Mr Collins said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We have done extensive interviews in campsites in the mining sector and they are coming back to us highlighting that when people go on leave, whether they are fly-in, fly-out or based in town, people understand they can take these synthetic illicits and then a day or two before coming back [to site] stop taking them because they know they will be out of their system.""
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Collins highlighted that because of the nature of the drug use, there is no data collected to validate it.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It is all anecdotal but it is a reality based on the interviews we are conducting,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Police raids
&gt; 
&gt; In December, Western Australian police began raiding mine sites across the Pilbara, using police dogs to search miners' bags at a Fortescue Metals Group mine. Raids at BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Pilbara airstrips followed in January.
&gt; 
&gt; All three companies supported the police operations and participated in a meeting with police where local officers raised concerns about increasing drug use in the Pilbara.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe they are doing enough in this space. You need to put that time and energy into education of managers and employees.
&gt; 
&gt; The raids followed a separate operation launched in early December to address drugs being imported through the Port Hedland airport and the town's port, where the bulk of the nation's iron ore is exported.
&gt; 
&gt; No miners were caught with drugs. But it sent a warning to the sector.
&gt; 
&gt; A 2013 survey by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found 2.1 per cent of Australians said they had used methamphetamine or amphetamine in the past year. This number is in decline but 50.4 per cent of those users said the main form of the drug they used was ice, up from 22 per cent when the survey was last conducted in 2010.
&gt; 
&gt; Western Australia's methamphetamine-usage rate is close to double the national average, with the number of methamphetamine users in the state opting for ice up from 43.9 per cent to 78.2 per cent.
&gt; 
&gt; While there is plenty of anecdotal evidence the situation in the state has worsened in recent years, getting hard numbers around it is difficult because of the lag in government statistics.
&gt; 
&gt; The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union recently for called for ""blanket"" drug and alcohol testing in a bid to stamp out illicit drug use, particularly ice, in the construction industry.
&gt; 
&gt; The resources industry is also concerned about the impact of workers using drugs in their own time, concerned it may hinder their ability to do their jobs even when they do not test positive for any illicit drug use while on site.
&gt; 
&gt; Industry performance
&gt; 
&gt; Perth-based forensic science lab ChemCentre provides analysis and scientific advice to government and industries, including mining companies.
&gt; 
&gt; Nathan Sumner, ChemCentre team leader of workplace toxicology said both on-site urine and oral fluid tests were effective in detecting drug use but depending on how fast a person metabolised a drug, some synthetic substances could leave the body within hours.
&gt;
&gt; One of the growing concerns resources companies were raising, according to Mr Sumner, was how to go beyond the tests to ensure people were ""fit for work"".
&gt;
&gt; ""One of the issues is what we call the hangover effect,"" he said. ""So the employee might not have a positive drug test they might have been awake for three days before, or been partying all night so while they are not under the influence drugs, they are tired and it might affect how they can drive a truck or do things like that.
&gt; 
&gt; ""It's often not just about whether there are drugs present but also: can the person function properly and do their role?""
&gt; 
&gt; Australasian Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health chief executive Jennifer Bowers said companies were developing thorough education programs, not only for employees but also for management level staff to help identify when someone was not fit for work.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Mining companies have strict regime in terms of on-site testing and are very conscious of the impact on safety,"" she said. ""I think companies are really on the front foot in terms of education.""
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Collins said mining companies could do better.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I don't believe they are doing enough in this space,"" he said. ""We have some leaders who are putting in high level management upskilling programs to help them identify risks and symptoms. There are not enough organisations doing that but rather putting their head in the sand, saying they have a policy of no drugs and people don't seem to be taking it and that's where they leave it. You need to put that time and energy into education of managers and employees.""
&gt; 
&gt; BHP Billiton said it provides education and awareness training, confidential counselling to employees and support for workers seeking treatment for drug and alcohol-related issues.
&gt; 
&gt; ""BHP Billiton has extensive health and safety management systems in place to support the physical and psychological health of its entire workforce,"" a spokeswoman said. ""As part of this we require our businesses to implement risk-based alcohol and drugs testing programs.""

But like most bans it came about from a business losing profits. Newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst, the Rupert Murdoch of the early 20th century, had big interests in timber plantations to print his papers and was threatened by the alternative of hemp which could be produced much more cheaply. So he directed his papers to run a campaign against hemp/cannabis by turning this effective and multi purpose plant into a dangerous drug that would ruin society. He directed cannabis to now be called “marijuana”, a drug that was smuggled by evil Mexican crime lords and would be given to “jazz singers” (a dog whistle against black people) who would get high and sleep with young white girls. White Americans reacted in horror and hemp/cannabis was quickly demonised and banned.","178","2024-04-04T13:42:41","0","t3_1bvajnb"

"1387","kxz7xar","1bvajnb","anakaine","It's going to be an interesting battle, that's for sure. Hopefully the CFMEU will fund it.  As it stands the legislation in many states has something to the effect of making site management personally responsible for injury and death on site, and its a rigorously enforced thing. So for site admin and others above in the companies to discharge their legal obligations they must, by law, lower risks to the lowest reasonable level.


Reasonable level has been tested in many states previously, and outlawing going to work under the influence of prescription medications which cause some level of impairment and/or cause positive drug screens is pretty widely accepted across the industry and legally. The on site process looks something like: Declare medication and prescription, piss/swab test, go positive, present prescription, forced time off (typically paid, unless you're a contractor) waiting for lab tests to confirm its prescription and not party drugs, rinse and continue.


I'm most curious to see how they will work this in with impairment timeframes and declarations before testing. If they fail to do this, that's likely a good window for a motivated industrial body to drag them through the court on discrimination based on prescribed medication residue but not impairment, and thus not operating under the mining legislation and outside the presumed bounds of OHS legislation, whilst flying against enabling healthcare legislation and against a patients medical plan.","9","2024-04-04T17:46:39","1","t1_kxyagm4"

Firstly, I understand there are many possible outcomes from taking medicinal / non medicinal cannabis - but hey at least medicinally prescribed cannabis is regulated.
But, why specifically for mining workers? Is it just to do with their 0 aim for health and safety? Because if zero harm is so important to them, how about they treat their workers like human beings with emotions and families... I'm going to guess that mental health issues cause more problems than workers deciding to dabble in cannabis use in their RnR. 

If it's so important for mine workers, why aren't we testing surgeons, GPS, teachers, psychologists, child care workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers.... Anyone that literally has someone else's lives in their hands? Why is it just mine workers - I genuinely don't understand. 

Obviously no one wants people to be sucking down cones before starting a 12 hour shift onsite, getting schizophrenia or anything like that.

At least  2 of the examples you have given are subject to random drug and alcohol testing, these are the driver categories and the tests are administered by the government.  

The last point is the mining industry is an extremely dangerous occupation, individuals, co-workers, and millions of dollars are at risk of harm due to a single accident. Each of your examples has different extrinsic and intrinsic points that need to be addressed individually, for example, a surgeon or psychologist risks mainly the patients they interact with, while childcare workers might be considered more high risk due to the interaction with their clients.","2","2024-04-04T17:42:29","1","t1_kxz46q3"

&gt; Rio Tinto hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the destruction of ancient rock shelters in Juukan Gorge three days before it was destroyed in a mining blast, according to meeting notes released to a parliamentary inquiry.

&gt; The meeting was called after the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners asked Rio Tinto to delay the blasting and named the rock shelter as a significant heritage site.

&gt; Since the blast, Rio Tinto said it had reviewed more than 400 of the 1,780 Aboriginal heritage sites which it currently has approval, under s.18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act WA, to destroy.

&gt; Aboriginal landowners have called for a &amp;quot;Reset&amp;quot; in Australia&amp;#039;s lucrative mining sector after an inquiry pilloried Rio Tinto for blowing up a 46,000-year-old heritage site to expand an iron ore mine.

&gt; An Australian parliamentary inquiry recommended late Wednesday that the Anglo-Australian mining giant pay restitution to the PKKP, rebuild the destroyed site and commit to a permanent moratorium on mining in the area.

&gt; The site had contained some of the oldest Aboriginal artefacts ever found in Australia and was considered sacred by the PKKP..

I get that applying geological timescales to human times scales is hard, even harder to make it seem important relative to our own speck of quick existence, but fuck, can’t someone on that site have wrapped their minds around if for a minute, found some moral fortitude and said ‘Nah maybe not hey?’.

I mean, they sold out unimaginable windows to human history for some low grade ore to send to China. Half the country is iron ore you could’ve scraped it up in any other place. For the profit a multi national that will just offset its profits so it has to pay minimal revenue to our country anyway. You don’t even have to appreciate aboriginal cultures to realize on every level, humanity’s been fucked over as well as Australia as a nation.

I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly, with regard to anyone not a white male worker. 

But this situation took the cake. And outlined, to me, how utterly clueless big mining is.

On commencement of employment with BHP at the new shiny South Flank in mid 2021. I witnessed a situation that still blows my mind to this day. 

The Mulla Mulla camp is truly a modern, well appointed, camp. With a cafe, bar, multiple gyms, meditation, music and rec rooms. 

And BHP had a full on no harassment policy in place with training. For employees. Etc. 

And yet they had a couple of thousand BHP employees. Many of whom where young woman new to mining. In a camp alongside 100’s if not a thousand non BHP construction contractors. Full of young men having an awesome time with no alcohol limits (at that time). All mixing at the main bar. Which most people had to walk through to get to their accommodation. 

I spotted the potential problem immediately. And it was only weeks before the first media stories surfaced of rape and attempted rape in that camp. 

But not a single BHP manager seemed to have an issue with this. Which I brought up in pre-start meetings, and often commented on. No one was interested.

And it wasn’t until construction was finished and all the dickhead construction contractors left that things quieted down. But by that time the damage was done. 

This just highlighted the problem mining has with ANY equality. Gender bias is not exclusive. I have seen, and continue to see, ANYONE who is not one of the group. Get picked on mercilessly. Every day. And every night. 
It really is just a symptom of the issues in our Australian community. But magnified by the mining lifestyle.

Mining management doesn’t really care. As all they ever do is try and keep everything quiet. And it hasn’t changed much in 24 years.

TLDR: Mining management are truly clueless. And don’t really care.","32","2024-12-11T21:43:44","0","t3_1hbnue0"

Great leaders know that well documented harassment is totally unacceptable 



Mining work may be difficult and take place in remote places, but there should always be respect

I’ve seen some of the best women succeed in the remotest parts of Canada where I suspect the culture already supports a strong level of equality

Australia aspires towards this level of integration but struggles at times with older generations, IMHO.

Chile is a strange mix of very capable women in mining despite the historic religious preference for traditional roles.  I think the mix of talent, education, and performance overwhelms any systemic hesitance

The opportunities and needs call out to more women in the mining workforce because they bring a unique perspective to challenges and leadership choices

This perspective comes because they are women.  Their minds, bodies, and life experiences are shaped by different factors

Working through the early years in mining, they will harden their conclusions about certain types of men in the workforce whose careers will diminish as these women advance into leadership roles

One thing is certain, the personal rewards from a mining career bring tremendous satisfaction and far outweigh petty engagements of the ignorant, who you will find in every industry.  

Any issue of safety, personal risk, or assault should be raised immediately, loudly, and all the way up the chain of command as soon as possible without hesitation, WITHOUT HESITATION.

Anyone who says otherwise has something to hide and is exactly the reason your executive leadership wants to know the facts

You better have a damn good notebook / logbook of dates and incidences, just like any safety issue.

Ne verujem da bi ovde bili isti komentari da je Dinko Gruhonjić bio govornik i da je rekao nešto protiv pravoslavaca na primer, i ne verujem da bi ostavio isti komentar kako su ""našli priliku da se stave u ulogu žrtve"".  Već bi ga svi pljuvali zbog prisvajanja protesta i retorike podele.

Kačio je ovde jedan lik temu gde je kukao kako protest ima previše ruskih zastava, desničarskih obeležja i majici Ratka Mladića i svi smo mu s pravom rekli da ne sere, i da ne treba potencirati takve stvari koje izazivaju podele i skreću pažnju sa glavnog razloga protesta.

Došlo je do te mere da je više LGBT organizacija moralo da izdaje saopštenja kako nemaju nikakvu povezanost sa Rio Tintom, ali tu razne pretnje nisu prestajale. Na više mojih postova i u privatnim porukama su me pitali gde su to LGBT osobe na protestima? Obično svaka diskusija je prestajala posle ovakvog potanja:

&gt;hoćete li vi braniti LGBT osobu koja ima jasna obeležja LGBT zajednice, kada bude napadnuta na tom protestu ili ćete se i dalje praviti da ne one ne postoje ako žele da zaštite svoju bezbednost, te su tu bez obeležja?

Upotreba litijuma: Litijum je efikasan tretman za bipolarni poremećaj, koji može biti posebno koristan za osobe koje doživljavaju ozbiljne promene raspoloženja.

Važno je uzeti u obzir jedinstvene potrebe za mentalnim zdravljem LGBTQ+ osoba, koje mogu imati veće stope mentalnih problema zbog diskriminacije, stigme i manjinskog stresa.

Usled nastavka trenda povećanja broja samo-dijagnostifikovanja poremećaja, procena je da će se samo-lečenje litijumom dodatno povećati. I tako se ugrožene grupe osećaju još više ugrožene jer su u grču usled neizvesnosti otvaranja rudnika litijuma u Srbiji.","2","2024-08-06T07:06:29","0","t3_1ektyii"

Ne neophodno zato što osoba promeni stav, nego zato što progres dostigne tačku za koju su se borili i preko toga im se čini previše. Onda nova generacija mora da gura dalje. I LGBT je primer. Nije ujedinjen. Mnogi L ne vole B. A i dosta mahom starijih LG ne vole T. A do juče su se borili za ista ta prava (nije da su sada jednaki, ali misle da im unazađuju progres koji su napravili).","13","2024-08-06T04:20:47","1","t1_lgn3fbn"

Дал има неко тамо паметан да истера идеју која нам је свима заједничка? Не копању! 

Разумети и схватити осећања и размишљања огромне већине Срба је кључ у овој заједничкој борби. 

Ићи на националну опцију и помињање Немаца као покушај треће окупације је ствар које ће довести до циља. 90 посто народа има негативна осећања према Немцима. Исти број према педерима. Пустите та woke срања. Такође увући цркву у причу и ако су тамо сви корумпирани. 90 посто људи поштује традицију и ако је много мањи број стварно религиозан. Црква је део наше традиције. 90 посто људи слави Славу. Размислиће још једном ако им црква каже копање није добро. Скорашњи пример, литије у црној гори су довеле  до промене, какве такве.

Мада кад боље размислим не би ме чудило да је СНС пустио овај плакат да изазове негативне реакције, или чак добро платио да се пљује по ЛГБТ-у. Дефинитивно тамо људи знају како се манипулише масама. Раде свој посао.

Along with artificial pride for them. 

Especially since the TGA only has the vaccines listed provisionally, and not fully approved. 

Which means Crown can say we’re only open for vaccinated customers, however, it cannot enforce them on their employees. 
Almost every vaccine, but especially provisional vaccines have always been opt in. 
Typically provisional medication is experimental cancer medication. Things that may help, but the full research isn’t out, but those people may be out of options and will try and anything. 

The problem with creating an artificial pride and morality with these vaccines, is that because there is nothing inherent to be proud about in them, making a medical choice, it implies everyone not taking them is therefore shameful. The point of pride derived from their shame. 

Layman’s terms. It’s a peer pressure tactic which I would have hoped our government and businesses were above. 

Whether you’re in favour against the vaccine or not. Applying both social and what seems like official pressure Re peoples medical choices, represents a dangerous precedent. 

So was the no jab no play. 
I have all the normal vaccines. But Re covid vaccines, many point to the no jab no play as precedent. 
In the future the covid vaccines and restrictions on the non vaccinated will be pointed to as some precedent. 

It also makes a mockery of what the HIV/ AIdS carriers fought for in the 90’s. Freedom from being medically persecuted. That their medical status cannot be ascertained, and society just had to adopt a higher level of hygienic practises.","-5","2021-09-15T10:13:09","0","t3_pnzgje"

Nama ne gine sukob vecih razmera jer mi ne zasluzujemo ovu generaciju studenata, bukvalno dece, koja vide gde idemo i sta radimo, iako smo ih osakatili i unistili im skolovanje (sa jedne strane ovu godinu im dugujemo svi mi, sa druge strane kakvu su srednju i osnovnu skolu imali, i kakve su tek sada skole Boze sacuvaj i hvala ti Boze sto ih sacuva i sto su ovakvi kakvi su).

  
Cinjenica da su samo prosvetari, medicinski radnici, univerzitetski radnici (sve tri fele samo delom, ne u vecini) i studenti jedini ustali na ovu situaciju pokazuje gde smo kao drustvo. Ovde govorim o drzavnim ustanovama, naravno cast izuzecima iz privatnih sektora. Pre svega isticem IT zajednicu (kolokvijalno ne znam kako bih drugacije nazvao, jer definitivno je u NS to siri pojam od ovoga koji koristim) koja je u Novom Sadu gotovo vise od 60% iznela finansije studenata u blokadi, plata prosvetara i meni se cini i u smislu ljudstva podrzala zborove u ogromnoj meri. Zato i ne pravi nasa drzava subvencije za ovaj sektor, kako bi ga osnazila i zastitila od trenutnog tobogana na kojem se mozda nalazi (ne znam punu sliku, malo citam sab programatora (morao sam) malo pricam sa ljudima). Uostalom, nasa drzava nije u stanju ni poljoprivredu da pomogne, granu koja nas hrani ili bi trebala da nas hrani, a gde tek neku drugu granu.

  
Da li SNS uhlebi stvarno misle da ce oni ziveti tako sa tim svojim pozicijicama i platicama kada ovo sranje krene da radi? Kada izvan Bora Zidjin krene da se siri? Kada krenu raditi punom parom sve fabrike guma po Vojvodini? Ta ideja da su se Zajecarci prodali masovno, da su se u Kosjericu u tri nedelje njih 70-oro prodali dok su oci cele Srbije bile uprte u njih, je zastrasujuca. Pored svega sto su studenti pokazali, mi smo imali najveci izliv neljudskosti upravo u ova dva mesta plus u mestima u kojima izbijaju pozari gde retardirani SNS-ovci idu na miting dok gore kuce njihovih komsija (a mozda cak i njihove).   
  
  
Ne zasluzujete SNS botovi, a znam da citate, ovu generaciju koja pokusava od vas naciniti ljude. Od govana nikada pita.","95","2025-07-11T05:25:30","0","t3_1lwkzak"

We all know the price curve will become flatter, and we want to do is remove thermal generation. So it does become more peaky.

&gt;MELBOURNE, Australia-- The Gladstone Power Station (GPS) Joint Venture confirms that CS Energy has formally notified the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) of the potential retirement of GPS in March 2029, aligning with the expiry of existing supply and operational arrangements.

&gt;The notification ensures compliance with the National Electricity Rules to provide notice of closure of electricity generators 3.5 years in advance. The notice period can be extended at any time.

&gt;No final decision has been made to retire GPS, which has operated since 1976, and there is potential to extend the life of the power station should market and other factors allow.

&gt;There is no immediate impact of this notification on GPS operations. Existing power supply contracts, including to Boyne Smelters Ltd, will remain in place until their scheduled expiry in March 2029.

&gt;The JV participants recognise the contribution of GPS to the Gladstone community and are committed to work with the operator NRG Gladstone Operating Services to ensure transparent and timely engagement with employees, contractors and suppliers throughout this process.

&gt;Between now and March 2029, the JV participants will engage with stakeholders on the energy market and on options for the future use of the site, which will inform the timeline and strategy for retirement of the facility.

&gt;GPS is an unincorporated joint venture of which Rio Tinto has a 42.125% stake. More information can be found here.

&gt;Notification was submitted to AEMO by CS Energy at the recommendation of the Joint Venture in CS Energy’s capacity as the nominated generator for GPS in the National Energy Market. CS Energy trades the output of GPS in excess of the Boyne Smelter requirements.","7","2025-10-01T11:39:01","0","t3_1nuu5sp"

I poslaše k njemu neke od fariseja i irodovaca, da ga uhvate u reči. Oni dođoše i rekoše mu: „Učitelju, znamo da si istinit i da se ne obazireš ni na koga; jer ne gledaš ko je ko, nego učiš putu Božijem u istini. Da li je dozvoljeno dati caru porez - ili nije? Da li da ga damo - ili da ne damo?“ No on sazna njihovo pretvaranje i reče im: „Što me kušate? Donesite mi novac da ga vidim.“ A oni donesoše. I reče im: „Čiji je ovo lik i natpis?“ Oni pak rekoše: „Carev.“ Isus im reče: „Dajte caru carevo, a Bogu Božije.“ I divljahu mu se.","0","2024-07-29T21:28:53","1","t1_lfgma4j"

Zato sto PRavoslavna Crkva,a pogotovu SPC nije institucionalizovana kao RImokatolicka i nema sisteme u kojima zaista ima kontrolu.Nema policiju,nema poluge za izvrsenje icega.Patrijarh i sinod mogu samo da opomenu i rascine nekog,a taj neko ako je opomena moze da baci taj papir u smece i nastavi po starom ili ako ga rascine da samo napravi svoju crkvu i ubedi narod u kraju da je on ispravan,sto se desavalo,pa zato i crkva strahuje od opominjanja odredjenih vladika.

Znaci crkva treba da se mesa kad ti pozelis? Uz takve kao tebe i SNS botove kada bi crkva bila opoziciona i politicka Vucic bi gledao da je urnise i napravio haos u narodu.Treba biti pazljiv.Mi u crkvi se borimo za Gospoda ISusa Hrista i Carstvo Nebesko.Sve ostalo je manje bitno.

Moras nauciti da crkva nije svetovna.Uloga crkve je da spasi dusu,da te priblizi Hristu pre nego sto umres. Da mozes da izadjes pred Hrista i steknes vecni zivot.I ovaj zivot na zemlji ce delovati kao [tren.To](http://tren.To) je poenta crkve.Mi cekamo Carstvo Nebesko i zivot buduceg veka.Jer po nasem verovanju,tek tada krece pravi zivot kakav ljudska bica zasluzuju.

A sto se tice Rio Tinta. Jasno mi je da se patrijarh ne oglasava,da je omeksao,da je ovo ipak bitna tema za sve nas i nasu zemlju.ALi ne znam. Godinama pratim njegov rad otkad nije bio patrijarh i oduvek je igrao kao dupli agent za Boga.On ima taj drugi [nacin.To](http://nacin.To) je odredjena svetogorska struja misljenja.Gde neki sveti oci misle da treba biti direktan,a neki da treba biti nevin kao golub a mudar kao zmija.Znajuci ga,toliko dugo,verujem da je ostao i bice uvek dupli agent za Hrista.Jer verujem da ce da rovari po SNSu za Hrista i na fin i perfidan nacin pokusavajuci da pridobije ljude,kao sto je uradio u Hrvatskoj gde su ga svi voleli.Da je ostao jos malo tamo,pridobio bi mnoge.Mozda gresim,mozda su to puste zelje,ali prateci ga skoro 2 decenije zelim da verujem da je ostao isti.

Sadruge strane imas mnoge vladike i svestenike koji su direktni.Koji su based i koji su se digli poput Arsenija koji je rekao da je spreman da pogine ako treba da ovi ne koipaju.I koji je rekao da mu je vec preceno zbog toga.

  
Nije na meni da osudjujem bilo koga.Pogotovu kad nemam sliku cele situacije 1/1.

Pljuvanjem Vucica necemo nista postici.Treba se ici sarkasticno.Ako se ova vlast busa u grudi da je patriotska(sto je naravno laz) treba ih podsecati na to i folirati se da mi u stvari zelimo da pomognemo nasoj patriotskoj vlasti da otera ""okupatora"". To bi izazvalo razdor izmedju Vucica i EU i napravili bi im haos i pomrsili konce.ALi mnogi ne kapiraju kako se stvari rade.Vucic je pljuvanjem dosao na vlast,nece pljuvanjem otici jer je to njegova igra i nece nikad izgubiti u svojoj igri.","3","2024-07-30T00:07:54","0","t3_1eeucj4"

[Syntilistalla on kaikkea mahdollista raamatulliset mittasuhteet saaneesta ympäristön turmelemisesta sisällissotiin:](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(yritys\))

&gt; Rio Tintolla oli Papua Uuteen-Guineaan kuuluvalla Bougainvillen saarella kuparikaivos vuosina 1972–1989. Maiden ja vesien saastuminen sekä kaivostuottojen epätasainen jakautuminen maanomistajien kesken johti kapinaan, joka kärjistyi lopulta tuhansia uhreja vaatineeksi sisällissodaksi. Hylätty kaivos aiheuttaa edelleen ympäristön pilaantumista. Vuonna 2021 joukko saaren asukkaita laati Australian hallitukselle valituksen kaivoksen aiheuttamista ympäristövahingoista. Tarkoituksena on edetä neuvotteluihin, alueen hoitotoimiin ja yhtiön asukkaille maksamiin korvauksiin. Rio Tinto kiistää vastuunsa kaivoksen aiheuttamista ympäristövahingoista.

&gt; Toukokuussa 2020 Rio Tinto räjäytti Australiassa alkuperäiskansalle kuuluneen 46 000 vuotta vanhan luolaston Juukanin solassa. Rio Tinto selitti tapausta väärinkäsityksenä, mutta myöhemmin tehdystä selvityksestä käy ilmi, että yhtiö tiesi paikan arvon, mutta räjäytti sen silti. Tapauksen seurauksena yhtiön johtoa joutui eroamaan. Tapaus aiheutti paljon närkästystä ympäri maailmaa ja myös yhtiön sijoittajissa. Neuvoa-antavassa äänestyksessä Rio Tinton sijoittajien enemmistö ei hyväksynyt väistyvien johtajien eropalkkioita. Yhtiö on kertonut ottaneensa tapahtuneesta opiksi ja haluavansa rakentaa luottamusta uudelleen alkuperäiskansojen kanssa.

&gt; Yhdysvalloissa Rio Tinto on osakkaana Resolution Copper -hankkeessa, jonka tavoitteena on kuparikaivos Apassi-heimon pyhille maille Oak Flatiin Arizonan osavaltiossa. Hankkeella ei ole alueen alkuperäiskansojen suostumusta. Vastustajien mukaan kaivos turmelisi alkuperäiskansojen pyhiä alueita, minkä lisäksi se uhkaisi alueen jokia, lähteitä ja pohjavesiä.

&gt; Mongoliassa Rio Tinto suunnittelee Oyu Tolgoin kuparikaivoksen laajennusta. Laajennuksen arvioidaan vaikeuttavan alueella elävien paimentolaiskansojen vedensaantia ja elämäntapaa.

&gt; Norjan valtion eläkeyhtiö veti sijoituksensa pois yhtiöstä vuonna 2008. Syynä oli erityisesti Rio Tinton osakkuus Indonesiassa sijaitsevassa Grasbergin kulta- ja kuparikaivoksessa, jonka jätevedet saastuttavat läheisiä vesistöjä.

&gt; Rio Tinton litiumkaivoshanke Serbian Jadarissa on johtanut voimakkaaseen vastustukseen ja laajamittaiseen kansalliseen protestiliikkeeseen. Mahdollisen kaivoksen ympäristövaikutuksia pidetään liian riskialttiina alueella, joka on maanviljelylle ja luonnon monimuotoisuudelle tärkeä. Jopa 15 000 maataloudesta toimeentulonsa saavaa taloutta on hankkeen vuoksi uhattuna. Tammikuussa 2022 Serbian hallitus perui Rio Tinton hankkeeseen liittyvät luvat. Yhtiö etsii vastustuksesta huolimatta edelleen keinoja jatkaa projektia ja kertoo arvioivansa lupiensa perumisen oikeudellisia perusteita.

&gt; Vuonna 2022 ulkopuolisen arvioijan tekemä raportti paljasti Rio Tinton työpaikoilta laajaa seksuaalista häirintää, rasismia ja kiusaamista, josta yhtiön työntekijät ovat joutuneet kärsimään.","108","2025-10-08T20:23:52","0","t3_1o154ms"

Tuo Litium-kaivos on hyvä esimerkki. Litiumia pidetään EU tasolla tosi tärkeänä, mutta samalla Suomi estää äärimmäisen tehokkaasti kaivostoiminnan perustamista.

"2144","k2027b5","16qy22j","sweet_chick283","Ok some context.

Rio Tinto is one of the two big Australian mining companies (the other being BHP). Considering the Aussie mining companies are one of the major reasons Australia escaped the GFC relatively unscathed, they have been able to get away with a hell of a lot with very little consequence for a long time.

However, the traditional owners of the land on which they want to dig their big holes have been fighting back. They have been trying to protect their sacred sites for years, and have finally started gaining a little traction with the media and the public.

You have to remember Australian Aboriginals have been on the land for 40,000-60,000 years. These sites are basically the Australian version of the [Lascaux caves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux). They have sheltered generations upon generations for tens of thousands of years, and are woven into their Dreamtime stories.

So the Aboriginal populations, especially those whose country Rio Tinto operates within, have been getting increasingly frustrated by the lack of care that is taken around their culturally significant sites.

What complicates this is that the Aboriginal people have only recently been able to establish native title claims that formalize their access to and ownership of the land that they have been custodians of for tens of thousands of years. When non-native private owners got their mits on the land before native title could be established, the Aboriginal people were effectively SOL; where a mining company had a lease, but not formal ownership of the land, it has been often a very messy grey area, but the Aboriginal people rarely get a fair outcome. 

This all kind of came to a head a couple of years ago with the [Juukan gorge debacle](https://reporter.anu.edu.au/all-stories/destruction-of-juukan-gorge-highlights-flaws-in-native-title). Basically, Rio blew up some rock shelters that wer some of the oldest in the world (and incidentally had promised not to), and became of how the law is structured, there was bugger all recourse open to the Aboriginal people. But Rio crossed their heart and hoped to die that they would never, never, never do it again. No, really.

And now they've damaged ANOTHER site that should have been protected. Less than 2 years later. And the likelihood of there being any formal/legal consequences whatsoever for Rio are slim to none.

Edit: So yeah. It's easy to think - it's just a couple of rocks falling. What's the big deal? But I don't know what cultural impact it will have on the Aboriginal people whose country it's on (I suspect there will be some pissed off spirits as a bare minimum, but it could cause a fair amount of psychological distress in those whose cultural duty it is to protect the land and the sacred sites), by an organisation who regularly get away with trampling over a group who are already pretty disadvantaged and will likely face no consequences for their actions.","137","2023-09-25T01:12:11","0","t3_16qy22j"

When Covid hit and the market tanked I actually bought some for 1.20 a share. My dollar cost average was 3.89 for all the shares purchased to that point. Recently after this past summer's stock I bought a big block of shares at 4.90. I honestly have not been able to get my head around the fact that analysts aren't upgrading the stock based on a TON of different revenue streams this company will have access too. In fact one analyst downgraded the stock from MKM Roth -- who i might add doesnt have a great track record imo. What am I missing ?? What are analysts missing ? A lot of it iI believe is they are sworn to secrecy with DOE DOD and various other agencies as well as other countries they deal with. They can't inform until they announce earnings and even then there are no specific details given. I believe in CEO Mark Chalmers. He's implemented the plan and they're in the process to initiate plan. He's making it happen with a lot of smart people they have acquired from recently acquired companies as well. In this respect he can continue to monitor uranium which he has multiple decades of experience and delegate other duties to people more qualified then him for REEs and medical isotopes divisions.

&gt; An inquiry into the destruction of Juukan Gorge has heard that Rio Tinto is expected to destroy another 124 Aboriginal heritage sites at a new iron ore development less than 100km away from the exploded rock shelters.

&gt; Robin Chapple, a WA Greens MP, told the inquiry that Collier gave consent under section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 on the basis of a recommendation from a meeting of the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee on 18 December 2013.That meeting ran for 50 minutes and considered 124 Aboriginal heritage sites, including the rock shelters known as Juukan 1 and 2.

&gt; In a statement provided after the hearing, Rio Tinto said it was currently undertaking a feasibility study on the proposed Western Range development, which included consultation with YAC.A Rio spokesperson said the company had taken steps to protect more than 250 of the 370 sites identified in the project footprint.

The options are ‘get little compensation or nothing’ either way the mining company gets its way. Some groups claim to ‘respect or listen’ but at the end of the day there’s no real choice when there’s more value in destruction and a government willing to write in loopholes to benefit themselves and mining companies.

Same thing happens to the US, Canada and elsewhere it’s Indigenous land until it has some value from logging, mining or pipelines and then old treaties are broken or loopholes get used.

"2307","g652n1k","iwxw22","himswim28","&gt; Problem with current legal situation and new laws is that it doesn’t let Aboriginal nations say no to mining.

Much of that is based on biased reporting.  That is important to note, because these sites are not just Aboriginal history, it is Australian and human history. Why are they allowed to sell off the rights to everyone's history?

Why the reporting is biased, is that the Aboriginal groups sold off mining rights at these mines, and agreed to the discovery rules for a handsome price for themselves, and had to turn over much of the power to the mine long term many decades ago. This was necessary to get the mines to be willing to pay the most and the capital costs to setup mines in the middle of no where. So because these groups agreed on the terms, often 50+ years ago, the Australian laws do not have protections that trump those contracts.  So it is true Australian protection laws do not allow them to rescind these agreements because of new findings, but they do allow significant delays.

Keep in mind, this was done when almost everyone was in favor of these mines. The governments tax money the money for the very poor aboriginal tribes, and guaranteed jobs for aboriginals. The Australian economy and economic growth was very dependent at the time on mining.  Not nearly as true today.","5","2020-09-22T05:47:47","1","t1_g63oo9u"

So the closing of Tiwai will mean a cut in global aluminium production. 

It will also free up the renewable energy that Tiwai used, just need to invest in capacity to move the electricity to where it is needed. Treasury modelling in 2013 (last time we bailed out Tiwai) [put that cost at $200m](https://i.imgur.com/co37man.png). It would mean that we would uses less coal and gas at Huntly.

Unions got rules put in place that require all people on site to wear hi-vis with a printed/stiched name on it. 

Also, the site has to provide one if you don't already have one.

So when the Labor PM visited one of the biggest job sites in the town he was in, he probably wanted to talk to the workers, being the Labor leader and all. To do so, he would have to follow site rules. 

You bunch of tinfoil hat wearing, windmill tilters.

Edit:

Ok so more info. Not everybody needs hi-vis. If you don't enter the mine proper, so you stay in the parts where the media would be allowed, you don't need to wear hi-vis.

Also, to attend site you need to do an induction before you arrive. Some sites allow you to do induction when you arrive, but that's not exactly the done thing anymore. 

Now lunch rooms and places they hold union meetings and such are all in the parts you do need hi-vis. There is more than one reason for that. Most of the suits don't have white cards. Plus having lots of people who don't need to be there, being there is a safety issue. Oh and it means you don't have people who aren't union members ""randomly"" walking into your union meetings

"2468","hq66x80","rpraix","Majesticpork","Answer: This is simply the lastest chaff in the long running discord between the Mongolian government and its mining investor over the mine.

Oyut Tolgoi mine was supposed to generate 5% of GDP growth per year for Mongolia. The contract was signed with Rio Tinto, a mining company. It began operation in 2013 and planned to increase it's capacity to 500k tonnes of concentrate per year, making it the 4th largest mine in the world.

Rio Tinto got really sweet initial deal with the mine because Mongolia is a pretty young state.

However, the costs have ran deep into 1.5bn over the budget of 6.7bn for the expansion.1st shipping of concentrate would be delayed by 2 years.

So the Mongolian government is pretty miffed about it because it didn't get any dividends with it's 34% stake in the mine for years and possibly more years to come as the delays and over run of the budget continues. It gets saddled with a huge debt as the mine continues to go deeper into debt.

Each side is blaming the other side. Rio Tinto blames corruption, inefficiency and red tapes while the government blames the company is fleecing the country.

Mongolia wants to renegotiate. So it was pressing aggressively for it.","536","2021-12-28T04:58:40","0","t3_rpraix"

This google earth compares the difference between the two parks, You can see that the Rio Tinto park A and B were empty and had nothing, which would cost less and the National Amusement park did give the land for free, compared to the Urt Tsagaan park where it is a residential area, that has plumbing lands, also there is the cost of acquiring the lands of the Urt Tsagaan park where it is largely a shop, i guess? and the city needs to pay the shop owners to leave their stores for demolishment, which results in more money, and as you know, most Mongolian's wont do it unless they get paid, typical, but it is what is.","4","2025-08-06T19:46:02","0","t3_1miwosn"

Honestly, I don’t get why people constantly complain about parking. If you choose to buy an apartment without a parking space, that’s your decision. And if you prefer to shop somewhere that has parking or not parking, again that’s your personal choice. It shouldn’t be the public’s job to subsidize expensive underground parking just to satisfy those preferences.

Ne znaju ni kako se izgovara Jadar, Loznica. Glavni argument lokalnom stanovništvu im je: But you will get money. Don't you want economic money? Čak ni naslov filma nisu pravilno preveli!

Report &gt; Misinformation

3.02 Serbia is not on the border of western Europe and Russia, it is more than 1000 km from the Russian border. The filmmaker keeps insinuating that Russia is financing protests in Serbia, despite none of his interviewees confirming this. The entire film smells like a Russian-scare propaganda film, and is financed by the European mining industry.

31.28 I've been following this project since the beginning, and this is the first time I've ever heard about radioactivity being a key concern.

\^promenite tekst da ne ispadne da sam Ruski bot.

Moj zvanični odgovor:

Rio Tinto has a long and rich history of broken promises given to local communities. The exact same can be said of the current Serbian government.

Supposedly, Rio Tinto has changed its ways and this time it will be different, especially because it’s in Europe? Excellent! Create a comparable project in the EU using ESG standards, so that we can then consider whether we should copy it in Serbia once a new government comes into power. There is absolutely no trust in the competence of the SNS government when it comes to obeying environmental laws, reducing corruption and developing vertical value chains.

Until these two factors change, the support of the local community for Rio Tinto will remain only a dream.","19","2025-02-20T23:10:38","0","t3_1itufrk"

If it makes you more supportive of the efforts of political.parties to address the issue of environmental and economic sustainability; it's worthwhile.

The more it’s discussed, the more it enters the public discourse, the more positive change is possible.

Having a dismissive or pessimistic attitude is your right as an individual, but it won't help.

First off, I'm a y12 graduate who knows that highschool does not prepare you for life or a job or anything except handling conflict and depression - if you make it out alive. You learn how to work at a factor in our outdated education, you learn how to be effective at the job you're passionate about in uni or tafe. Most of the time I spent in highschool that I still consider useful was the certificate ii I took, which is equivalent to a Tafe course and actually has resume value. Also the time at home after school and during lunches that I spent teaching myself instruments.

And the kids did organize this. I'm on the marshall team for tomorrow and they're at the top of the hierachy, three specific kids who organized the marshall team and recruited police liaisons, they collborated with the police themselves, they got the permits and decided the route, and have the final say on everything. More than any supporting adults involved. The inspiration for this whole movement is Greta Thunberg who I can guarantee you has no ghostwriters on her UN speeches.

And you can see where the money goes. There are so many articles from whistleblowers going into details about how many tax breaks massive corporations like Adani get, and all the government donations headed their way, and all the laws they're being allowed to dodge.

It is now included in the House’s $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. H.R. 1884 will repeal Section 3003 land exchange of the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, introduced an identical bill (S 915) in the Senate. The Save Oak Flat Act (SOFA) would protect a 2,422-acre site known as Chí’chil Biłdagoteel (Oak Flat), the foundation of traditional Western Apache culture and religion. Congress now has a historic opportunity to protect American Indian cultural and religious resources by enacting the Save Oak Flat Act, which is currently included in the House version of the budget reconciliation legislation in Subtitle B—Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands 3 SEC. 70201.

3. Your average yobbo doesn’t just take his screwdriver out and remove the source from a nuclear gauge so it’s easier to ship around.

There's just more rent to extract. 

(2) Qatar is a essentially a modern slave state. And I'm not talking slavery in the sense that ""Oh, some Indians on dodgy student Visas are getting paid $12/hour to pull nightshifts at Caltex"". That's bad enough, but it's not 'The entire construction industry is full of migrants that get paid $20 a day, and also their passports are confiscated, and their bodies are basically chucked in the concrete if they die on site"". More broadly, an absurd amount of the Qatari population are basically indentured servants with no citizenship or voting rights. If you think 5-10% of the working age population are on temporary visas is bad, try over 80%. 

It amazing how much more profitable it is to fund capital works projects when your upfront construction costs are 1/50th of what Australia's are. 

(3) Both of those states don't really have equivalents of the sort of mass scale private investing through superannuation. 

Not having to fund a welfare state, Qatar is much sillier than Norway with their investments. Think about how much money has been poured down the drain in the FIFA World Cup/ subsidising our flights to Europe through the airline. It's crazy.","7","2023-10-04T16:10:36","1","t1_k3dprpn"

"2771","k3dyrbp","16zb7jv","taj14","It depends. You look at other countries minninng operations, such as Norway, Mexico, Sweden, and the State ownership in those companies is insane. 

Reading the history of Norway's gov'd mining regulation is absolutely mindblowing. Norway’s Labour Party when elected to government in the early 1970s, with support from public servants, established substantial taxation of the international oil companies which came to drill in Norway’s new North Sea oilfields. It also successfully created Statoil, a national, publicly owned oil company which took a 50% ownership share of all new oilfields. It was designed so that the Norwegian community as a whole can become self sufficient. 

Here's another interesting part. When resource taxes were increased in Norway in 1974, large private oil companies protested angrily but, as one book explained, “the Norwegian Ministry of Finance … did not let itself be scared off. Its underlying understanding was … \[that\] the state had to aim for the greatest possible share of the economic” benefit from large oilfields “to go to the community”. Further, the ministry correctly judged that “as long as the oil companies secured profits which corresponded to, or were higher than, those in other industries”, then they would continue their operations."" Pretty much they didn't gaf what the large oil and mining companies were squealing about lost profits, wages, etc (same boogeyman tactics that they use here). Such a huge contrast to our politicians. Tey just get paid off with cushie jobs after they leave the office, ie McGowan and BHP.

With your thinking, can a Norwegian company come and drill in Australia? Sure it can! And it is doing it so in SA, that very same Statoil (now Equinor) which 2/3rd belongs to the Norwegian gov'd. Can Australian firms set up operations in Norway - sure they can, but the Norwegian state gov'd will own a large portion of the operation.

But I wonder if wanting to protect the wife and children (who were not there) is an attitude they extend to other contexts or if it's special to this case.  
Or maybe it's like how middle and lower class Americans oppose tax cuts to people richer than they'll ever be; they prefer to identify with the oppressors rather than the oppressed, even though they are being directly harmed by the people they're eager to protect and defend.  

I will add the caveat that I wouldn't be posting this if the children were home. (Though I don't think they'd be too harmed by a flag and smoking ceremony. Worse things happen outside houses in other suburbs all the time. And, depending on their ages, you could explain what's happening and reassure them. But it would still be pretty iffy.)

&gt; Their windows broken and roofs smashed, the abandoned homes in an otherwise bucolic valley carpeted with cornfields and orchards near Serbia’s border with Bosnia look like the wreckage of the Balkan wars of the 1990s.
&gt; 
&gt; But the houses are actually the casualties of a current struggle freighted with geopolitics: where and how Europe can get the materials it needs to make electric car batteries and break its dependence on sources like China.
&gt; 
&gt; The houses, in the Jadar Valley in the west of Serbia, were bought up years ago by the minerals behemoth Rio Tinto, which planned to tear them down and start mining and processing lithium, a crucial element for electric car batteries. Its plans stalled by vociferous opposition, the company left the properties to crumble.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The project has been supported by the United States and the European Union, which is in desperate need of lithium to [meet its climate goals](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/climate/europe-election-climate.html). But it has generated a wave of public fury in Serbia, where fears that the mine will poison the air and water have set off huge street protests against President Aleksandar Vucic.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Europe has plenty of lithium and more than 20 mining projects for the mineral at various stages of development. But none have started producing battery-grade lithium. The giant project in Serbia was aimed at filling that hole.

"2864","litg0bo","1evr66f","coolbern","&gt;The proposed mine in Serbia has not only provoked fury among farmers, environmental activists and ordinary citizens, it also has become a proxy battleground in the West’s efforts to extract the country from the orbits of Russia, its traditional ally, and China.

&gt;...Among those taking part in recent nationwide demonstrations against Rio Tinto have been leaders of People’s Patrol, an ultranationalist group aligned with Moscow. Social media accounts known for spreading Russian disinformation have been active in promoting horror stories about the planned lithium mine.

&gt;But leftists and middle-of-the-road pro-Europeans have also joined the protests, chanting opposition to a project that has become a lightning rod for diverse grievances against the government.

&gt;“He sold out Kosovo but is not going to take away our clean water,” read a sign denouncing Mr. Vucic that was held by Angela Rojovic, 25, at a recent protest in Belgrade, the capital. She said the president had not done enough to defend the interests of 
Serbs living in mainly ethnic Albanian Kosovo.

&gt;And she said Mr. Vucic was sacrificing Serbia’s environment to serve Europe’s climate goals. “I don’t need green cars,” she said. “I need green apples and green grass.”

&gt;...Mr. Karajcic, the district head, said he was infuriated by German assurances that the mine would be safe, recalling Nazi atrocities in a nearby town in 1941 that the Germans had promised would be left unhurt.

&gt;He said his great-grandfather fought nearby against Austrian troops during World War I. “He fought to keep our land, and now I’m supposed to give it away to Rio Tinto. No way,” he said. “There is a lot of bad blood in these hills.”","12","2024-08-19T12:57:27","0","t3_1evr66f"

[Harry Dempsey in London and Nic Fildes in Sydney](https://www.ft.com/content/620fd8c0-ca40-4ffd-93fb-2297a0987e89):

*Iron ore prices have hit their lowest level in two years as China’s stricken property sector depresses steel demand, threatening to squeeze earnings at the world’s largest mining houses.*

*Prices for the key steelmaking ingredient have plunged by more than a third since the start of the year, cumulatively wiping off about $100bn in market capitalisation of the “big four” iron ore miners — BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale and Fortescue.*

*Hu Wangming, chair of Baowu Steel, the world’s largest steel producer, warned this week that the sector was in crisis, facing a “winter” that was “longer, colder and more difficult” than the previous market downturns of 2008 and 2015.*

*Iron ore is a cash cow for the world’s biggest miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto, giving them the firepower to make bumper returns for investors and a solid foundation for growth in other commodities such as copper and fertiliser.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Until recently, many executives seemed unfazed by the demand declines in China.*

*Rio chief executive Jakob Stausholm last month told the Financial Times that steel demand for Chinese property had dropped 100mn tonnes but had a 40mn tonne boost from the energy transition between 2020 and 2023. That is a fraction of the 1.9bn tonnes of last year’s global iron ore production.*

*Steel mills in China are currently making negative profit margins because of a glut of the construction metal, piling pressure on them to cut production to boost prices and survive.*

*Xinying Yao, director of steel at SMM, a Shanghai-based metals data provider, said given the time between purchasing land to construction, it was difficult to see demand for steel from the property sector improving in the next 12 months.*","2","2024-08-19T11:07:11","0","t3_1evp3d6"

Bailouts-for-equity are obviously much fairer to the public than the current model which is to structure a bailout as an interest-free or low-interest loan. The post-Covid inflation rate is much higher than the interest rate charged on any bailout loan, so these loans effectively earn negative interest. In other words, free money to the corporations.

The government did get six percent of Air Canada as part of its Covid bail out, but unloaded that stake soon afterwards. Meanwhile, any debt still owed by Air Canada is quickly being inflated away.","38","2025-07-05T10:36:05","1","t1_n1e8zct"

As someone who worked in large plants for 20 years, problems like this are rarely not known about beforehand.  The only way to curb bullshit like this is to fine them massive amounts of money, not just a 'tax for doing busniness' and someone needs to be put in jail.  Then other companies would start doing something about similar problems.","69","2025-08-17T02:47:53","0","t3_1mrzk8e"

In my own experiences usually all the guys on the floor know the details of the problem and a few ways to fix it, so they bring it up with lower management. Middle management then sticks their fingers in their ears because Upper management doesn’t want to hear about problems, it’s bad for the shareholders.

The solution is officer accountability. Discovery for how far up it went, and consequences / charges / time sentences to officers who entered the public / made bad safety calls for profit / etc. it is time to stop corporations from shielding officers for these calls that are causing harms. It is time to incentivize officer compliance with individual accountability. How that actually looks? Unknown, but when there's a safety problem that kills one or more people, at least one person needs to suffer consequences from the state.

"3093","n92j3l3","1mrzk8e","Rummoliolli","The release likely was part of tripping out the system in order to prevent damage to the equipment and personnel. Our boilers when they trip will run the fan for 2 volumes of the furnace to ensure any gases are purged out. This also happened after maintenance was done on the system so possibly a valve was left closed. Something simple as 1 valve being left closed can cause an issue to prevent a pump from starting, and since it is a cooling pump most equipment will trip out to prevent damage from overheating and the coolant boiling. Considering the spike in emissions was brief it likely was from the equipment tripping out, which is likely factored in for emissions regulations so they didn't get fined. The thing I'd blame management for is not giving enough time like they usually do for maintenance. As an operator I wonder if they test run the equipment after maintenance is done to prevent finding out unexpected issues like someone forgetting a cooling water supply valve closed to the feedwater pumps, we do that to prevent finding out issues that trip out the line while in production or delay startup. Also you should know that there are some special operators out there that make dumb mistakes and don't realize what's going on infront of their eyes even(I work with some unfortunately).","2","2025-08-17T06:53:25","1","t1_n918tuy"

"3099","n92l3kq","1mrzk8e","Rummoliolli","The release is because of the upset from the cooling system not activating and then the equipment likely bypassing and shutting down immediately to prevent overheating which will release a small amount of emissions but hopefully prevent injury to personnel or equipment.

Rio Tinto’s blind pursuit of profit at any cost has caused disputes with numerous unions as well as environmental, community and indigenous groups.

Za vreme Drugog Svetskog rata, imali su kontrolu cena kompanije, veliki deo proizvodnje pirita bio je kanalisan silama Osovine (Nemačka i Italija). 

Zapadna Australija je imala dokaze od 46.000 godina ljudske civilizacije u svetom mestu australijskih Aboridžina u klisuri Juukan. Rio Tinto je i pored alternativnih opcija, ipak odlučio da uništi tu klisuru da bi mogao da proširi svoj rudnik. Ovaj incident se desio 2020. godine i nakon njega je svaka normalna država odlučila da prekine apsolutno svaku saradnju sa pomenutom kompanijom.

Kompaniji to i dalje nije prekinulo biznis, jer znaju, da dok god ima gnjida na visokim pozicijama, oni će moći da nastave da rade šta god namere.","60","2024-06-13T23:25:56","0","t3_1dey2ap"

 Ovo oni zovu nacrt. Ja kad sam kao studirao nesto inzenjerski ovo se nije zvalo nacrt, ovo se zvalo ""brosura"", nacrt bi sadrzao nesto. Ali dobro. 

 Sta je bitno konstatovati, a sta pise:

&gt;zabranjeno je započinjanje bilo kakvih radova bez zvanično odobrene studije o proceni uticaja na životnu sredinu od strane nadležnih državnih institucija Republike Srbije

 Sta ovo znaci:

1. Rio Tinto Srbija objavi konacnu studiju. 
2. Tu studiju mora neko da odobri, tj. da se saglasi da su predlozene mere dovoljne. 
3. Tek onda moze da pocne realizacija. 

 Kljucan je korak 2. Kritike imaju smisla KAD se studija objavi. Ja sumnjam da postoji bilo koji nacin za eksploataciju litijuma iz slozene rude na lokaciji koja je bogata podzemnim vodama, plus bogata biljnim svetom - ali definitivno ne mozemo sa sigurnoscu reci da ne moze dok ne vidimo studiju. 

 Kad vidimo studiju ono sto je bitno je da je odbacimo kao nezadovoljavajucu, tj. da ne dozvolimo drzavi i njegovom bratu da ovo proguraju kao ""eto, ima studija"". Pre toga je sve samo neoludizam, kad (nova) studija izadje - onda je moguce delovati.","16","2024-06-13T23:52:24","0","t3_1dey2ap"

SANU je 6. i 7. maja ove godine organizovala naučnu raspravu na temu “Projekat Jadar - šta je poznato?” gde su pitanja uticaja rudarskih aktivnosti Rio Tinta bile detaljno raspravljana;

1. Spomenuto je razaranje pećina Aboridžina u Jukan klisuri koje su stare oko 46.000 godina. Ove pećine predstavljaju neprocenjivo arheološko i antropološko blago koje je istovremeno i jedino mesto kohabitacije ljudi koje je neprekidno bilo nastanjeno sve do danas.

Ne samo da je medjunarodna javnost bila zgrožena radnjama Rio Tinta, već je i sam predsednik specijalnog komiteta, oformljenog of strane australijskog Senata radi istraživanje ovog slučaju, Warren Entch izjavio da se nekontrolisan rad rudarskih  firmi “Nikada vise ne sme ponoviti”. Povrh svega odgovorna lica, uključujući i svetski-poznatog Žan Sebastijen Žak, su bila svesna mogućnosti nastanka štete i nisu ništa uradili da spreče njen nastanak.


2. Rio Tinto je 45 godina eksploatisao bakar i zlato iz rudnika Panguna na ostrvu Bugenvil u Papui Novoj Gvineji. Rudnik je napustio 2016. godine i za sobom ostavio milijardu tona toksičnog rudnog otpada. Panguna je bio jedan od najvećih svetskih rudnika bakra i zlata, a 1989. godine je lokalno stanovništvo podiglo pobunu protiv njegove uprave. 

Usledio je krvavi desetogodišnji građanski rat, u kome je Rio Tinto, po pojedinim izvorima, pomagao korumpiranu stranu.

Rio Tinto je na Bugenvilu za sobom ostavio totalnu ekološku katastrofu, zatrovanu životnu sredinu, bolesno i siromašno stanovništvo, decu sa čirevima po koži koji ne zarastaju jer su zemljište, voda i vazduh zatrovani bakrom. Nesrećni stanovnici Bugenvila pokušali su da pred sudovima u Americi traže naknadu štete za užase koji su pretrpeli i još uvek trpe oni i njihova deca. Spor s Rio Tintom u Americi trajao je deset godina. 

Posle deset godina, američki sudovi su se oglasili nenadležnim. Rio Tinto odbio je da isplati i jedan cent odštete u ovom sporu. Trenutno se pred australijskom vladom nalazi zahtev koji je podnelo 156 stanovnika ostrva Bugenvil za povredu njihovih ljudskih prava. Pre incidenta s uništenjem aboridžinskih pećina, Rio Tinto je uložio svu svoju kreativnost i mnogo novca da dokaže da nije odgovoran za Bugenvil, ni za otrovane reke i zemljište, ni za milijarde tona toksičnog otpada, ni za decu punu čireva ni za bolesno stanovništvo. Više od deset godina takvog herojskog napora Ria Tinta nije za potcenjivanje.

Pored toga, mi nikada nismo republički  referendum još od 1994 dok su pol. stranke i vlada vise puta upotrebili ovaj pravni instrument, prevashodno u političke svrhe.

Iako nade nemam da ćemo nesto uraditi povodom ovoga, bilo bi prijatno kada bi veca narodna inicijativa mogla biti pokrenuta kako bi se makar odvratila ova potencijalna ekološka katastrofa.","4","2021-10-10T10:34:38","0","t3_q4jftl"

If I go to HR and get someone fired, my career will be over. and there’s nothing a corporation can do to protect me from that.  If they step in after, it’s a snowball effect. It’s a tough world but I’ve learnt how to live in it, and if anyone crosses the line (which my line is pretty far) I will deal with them myself first.

&gt; The package, which includes basic pay, overtime, pension and free travel, is the equivalent to what is paid to some deputy head teachers and senior NHS managers.
&gt;
&gt; Critics condemned the scale of the salary and perks that totalled £61,218, describing them as “platinum-plated”.
&gt;
&gt; Figures released by Transport for London (TfL), under Freedom of Information laws, showed that a basic tube drivers’ salary in the capital was £42,424.
&gt;
&gt; According to the statistics, published on Tuesday, employer pension contributions totalled £13,151 and overtime £1,361.
&gt;
&gt; Drivers can also earn a “customer service bonus” of £250, which is paid to all staff depending on passenger satisfaction levels, and are entitled to free travel, including a spouse or partner, worth more than £4000 a year for an annual zone six season ticket. TfL chiefs declined to identify the highest paid driver.

If a stock corporation wants to have a say how a share may be traded, they have to issue nominal shares (also called registered shares, pure shares, personal shares, or name shares).

Neformalno priznanje Kosova se trampi za prećutnu podršku nedemokratskom režimu. Svi ostali, uključujući i kosovske Srbe čija prava neće biti osigurana, će ostati golog dupeta.

Potpisivanje ovog sporazuma ne samo da je štetno za ljude dole, već će ugušiti i bilo kakvu demokratsku perspektivu za ostatak Srbije. Podrzavanje autokrate samo zato što direktivu koju ispunjava dolazi iz EU je u biti antievropsko.

Druga opcija vam je odbit to . Onda ce vam zamrznut eu fondove i uvest prvo tihe sankcije ( nema novih investicija npr ) koje ce vam progresivno pojacavat ( Swift , izvoz itd ) a Kosovo ce i dalje ostat realno Albansko plus polozaj tamosnjih Srba ce postat apsolutno nesnosljiv .

Nema veze, cekacemo i 10, 20, 30, .. 100 godina ali cemo docekati.

U ovoj drzavi svako ko je opozicija pljuje po Vucicu. Dobro opozicija si, a reci ti nama sta bi ti uradio? Kako bi ti vodio drzavu? Kako bi ti resio pitanje KiM? Kako bi resio uticaj GLOBALNE inflacije na Srbiju? Kako bi pomogli Srbima koji zive na KiM? Kako bi resili pitanje Republike Srpske?

Sta sa stanjem u makedoniji, gde je sprski identitet skoro izumreo. Sta je sa Srbima u Albaniji koji su primorani da promene svoja imena i prezimena i veru? Sa Srbima u hrvatskoj koji su takodje primorani na iste stvari? Sto se ne trazi od medjunarodne zajednice da osude Oluju i Bljesak? Da ne pricam o Jasenovcu... Dosta mi je vise da slusam kako je Vucic los, hocu da cujem koliko si ti dobar. A videli smo koliko ste dobri. Dosta mi je Tadica, dosta mi je Djilasa, znamo kako je vodio Beograd i sta je radio... Ne pada mi na pamet da glasam za nekog samo zato sto je ""nije Vucic"". Mnogo nas ovde razmislja o tome sta ce biti sa Vucicem ako potpise ili ne, a niko nije napisao sta ce biti da narodom na KiM ako on to potpise, niti sta bi Vi uradili da ste na njegovom mestu.

"3801","msuo7pl","1kp2uvj","pintord","    Le Groupe Rio Tinto prévoit investir jusqu'à 1,2 milliard de dollars américains d'ici 2032 pour moderniser sa centrale électrique québécoise, vieille de 99 ans, malgré les tarifs imposés par l'administration Trump sur les importations canadiennes d'aluminium.
    La centrale hydroélectrique de l'Isle-Maligne, située à Alma, à environ 480 kilomètres au nord de Montréal, alimente en électricité les alumineries de Rio Tinto dans la région. L'entreprise a déclaré dans un communiqué qu'il s'agissait du « plus important investissement unique dans ses actifs hydroélectriques depuis les années 1950 ».
    « Cet investissement majeur pour moderniser nos installations assurera la pérennité et la compétitivité de notre production d'aluminium à faible teneur en carbone au Québec pour les décennies à venir, pour nos clients canadiens et américains », a déclaré Sébastien Ross, directeur général des opérations de Rio Tinto dans la région de l'Atlantique, dans un communiqué. L'entreprise emploie environ 4 000 personnes au Québec.
    Le président américain Donald Trump a imposé des taxes de 25 % sur les importations d'acier et d'aluminium en mars. Jusqu'à présent, les expéditions d'aluminium n'ont pas été fortement touchées, les coûts ayant été répercutés sur les acheteurs, ont indiqué les chemins de fer canadiens aux analystes il y a environ deux semaines.
    Le projet de modernisation comprend le remplacement de huit groupes turbine-alternateur et la remise en état de leur prise d'eau et de leur passage hydraulique.
    Rio Tinto a également commencé l'agrandissement de son aluminerie de Saguenay, au Québec, en 2023, avec l'installation de 96 nouvelles cuves utilisant la technologie de fusion à faible teneur en carbone AP60, pour un coût de 1,1 milliard de dollars.
    L'entreprise prévoit investir environ 4 milliards de dollars en dépenses d'investissement de maintien cette année pour l'ensemble de ses activités dans le monde.","28","2025-05-18T06:48:19","0","t3_1kp2uvj"

This company still have good potential and is a longterm hold, gamble yes but still have something speaking for it in the years to come.
This DD was great, we all have different opinions.
Some sell, some hodl the bag.
As long as one invests money they can afford to lose and have patience, it might come out with a reward.
People say ""high risk, high reward"", yet they are the ones selling as soon as an ER is at best average and if less than that they turn on a dime and declare the company as sh*t etc.
You dream of instantanious riches like its a powerball draw for your numbers, but you lack the patience if the # aint in your ballpark.
This DD was even better than my own from months ago when I decided to invest, and on that note I didnt go regard apesh*t with balls in deep with my money.
In a few years it'll show, if I lost my money or came out on top, in it for the real long painful ride, atleast I wont chicken out.

Thanks for a great DD, its up to each one of us to decide upon our investments put people here dont grasp the potential due to one average resulted ER, lack of present PR's etc.

Pa onda dodatno pitanje:
Da li podržava eksploataciju litijuma na bezbedan, siguran i ekološki način?
Pa onda da li podržavaju ekoloske katastrofe i izlivanja u arteške i ostale podzemne vode?

Pitanje je politizovano do te mere da obe političke opcije - i opozicija i pozicija ne mogu da dodju do zajedničkog rešenja.

Ni jedni ni drugi ne veruju ni jedni ni drugima.

U medijima se pojavljuju likovi sa obe strane koji pricaju potpuno suprotne stvar.

Koji je moj stav po pitanju ovoga - ako moze da bude 100% sigurna ekspolatacija - zašto da se ne kopa - potrebni su nam novci i kao drzavi i kao gradjanima.

Ako eksploatacija nije sigurna, makar za 0.1% onda ne treba kopati.

Kako mi kao obični gradjani to možemo da znamo?
Tako što bi se vodio javni diskurs na ovu temu sa svim zainteresovanim stranama.
Da li će ovoga biti - neće. Imaćemo jednog čoveka koji nam sam ispred kamera crta po tablama, jer mora da nas edukuje.

Gde živiš ti? Jedini način na koji ova vlast vlada je praveći haos i krizu jer tako mogu 365 danagodišnje da budu u kampanji jer je to jedino što znaju da rade. Ne znaju da upravljaju državom, jer ti za to treba neko znanje i obrazovanje i stručnost, ali znaju da lažu i obećavaju. Njima je neophodno da se govori o stranim plaćenicima i patriotizmu i atentatima na predsednika, jer ako bi ljudi počeli da misle o ceni hrane i tome što nemaju vodu i kanalizaciju, vlast bi pala za mesec dana.

Dolivanje ulja na vatru je jedina taktika koju znaju jer mogu da funkcionišu jedino u haosu.","8","2024-08-14T15:04:43","0","t3_1erlvq3"

to je paradoks ljudskog drustva: sto je vlast sigurnija i mocnija, to vise ""slobode"" (u sustini iluzije slobode) moze sebi da priusti da dozvoli, i obratno.

najbolji primer su zapadnjacki liberalno kapitalisticki sistemi, cija je moc tolika da mogu da odrzavaju tu iluziju da su slobodna drustva - sve dok se veci broj ljudi ne organizuje da, recimo, trazi reformu policije ili zaustavljanje genocida koji sprovodi imperija, ili pravedniju raspodelu rezultata rada. onda se na ljude izvode policijski tenkovi, privode se, vode se medijske kampanje. sve ovo sto Dacic prica ovih dana je pricao i Bajden za studenstke proteste protiv genocida i Gazi - ako ne verujes, nadji na netu. Od reci do reci isto.

tako da zapravo obratno - umesto sto se stresiras oko eskalacije i dolivanja ulja na vatru, trebalo bi da budes srecan. Dolivanje ulja na vatru je siguran znak slabosti, jer realno njihova glavna moc je u monopolu nad silom i ako su u situaciji da moraju da vade taj stih to znaci da su im ostale karte (npr propaganda, ili podrska medju masama i slicno) izuzetno tanke.","7","2024-08-14T15:14:46","0","t3_1erlvq3"

Wouldn't $250M be better spent on health or education? Seems like a no brainer.

A few questions:

* In 20 years do you foresee Palantir being used beyond government contracts and Fortune 500 companies?
* Will it forever be a highly expensive, premium product or will there eventually be a Foundry Lyte for small to mid-size businesses?
* Is there a world where Palantir provides value to consumer's daily life? Could Palantir offer a Siri or Alexa competitor to help everyday people make good choices?

If I’m correct in the trajectory of Palantir moving toward being deployable by any competent SAP/Oracle/CRM developer in a few years, that would likely open up the aperture to smaller organizations. 

I don’t really know how you price it though. Perhaps as a percentage of top line income?

You might eventually see Foundry make its way into while labeled fitness/Health apps like Whoop or Oura, but I’d be skeptical there is value there versus a bespoke system built on open source software.","30","2021-02-16T12:54:58","1","t1_gnl1ryv"

I work in automotive QA. and  one of our the most critical decision we have to make is deciding on product recalls, production line stop, and stock disposal.

So based on this DD, PLTR Foundry would definitely seem like the Iron Man suit we need.

Unfortunately...  after watching the demo, it seems PLTR is nothing special, there's already plenty of other Iron Man suits out there, most of them battle tested, some even open source.

In my case, we use MSFT Power Platform, that's Power BI + Power Automate + Power Apps.  And its pretty neat, the bosses get their fancy dashboards, while we cut \~30%  manpower.

Spend few minutes watching videos of these MSFT these products, and you'll understand is basically the same thing. Only with MSFT, you have a bigger dev community, global support, smooth deployments and MSFT bundling it with their 365 stuff, making it practically free.  MSFT also use React for UX.

PLTR is basically a data transformation + data modelling +  automation + visualization SaaS. Nothing fancy about it.

Beating IBM is nothing. Like SAP, they're a boomer company, and like SAP, the only reason people keep buying them are legacy systems to expensive to migrate.

\- Use the word ""ontology"" a lot, really, a lot

Before you buy the hype, get the facts.

Full disclosure, I did buy PLTR at $11USD (near IPO) and sold my position at $25. So I'm not saying it's not an interesting play. However, from a functionality perspective, it's probably not the Optimus Prime the OP suggests it is.

With regards to big blue selling PLTR: Big Blue is a service powerhouse who sells its competitions software day-in day-out... while selling services (implementation, etc., which is where the money is).

PLTR has all the ingredients to become one of the most profitable, influential and integral data analysis companies of the future. I am not quite sure that the industry has a specific niche for their product suite. Very likely many products will be built and the whole segment is yet to be defined, around or within palantir ecosystem.

I wonder if anyone else knows some of these things..

- what is the avg implementation time for a client project?
- would the company have to change their internal operations  or is palantir less intrusive, than say an ERP or CRM?
- speaking of, where does it ""fit"" within current Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft, SAP, Netsuite world?
- biggest barriers to entry for an enterprise client?
- predictive analytics are becoming ""cheap"" SugarCRM has a very solid offering. Can palantir complete with a lower price point?
- is that even a competition?
- is palantir market limited to huge, billon dollar enterprises and government institutions?

If anyone could help. Cheers.","8","2021-02-16T13:40:17","0","t3_lkngg9"

&gt;  
&gt;But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.  
&gt;  
&gt;The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization.

While I agree with your conclusion, those are pretty crappy examples of business decisions where being data-driven doesn't help you much. There was no data available in the early 90s to convince Airbus execs that the hub-and-spoke model would be marginalized in favour of point-to-point. What was the difference between Microsoft dismissing the iPhone and Google jumping on Android? It wasn't data, it was (a lack of) vision.

Being data driven helps in many optimization scenarios like reducing the supply chain, like you described. But it doesn't make the company's leaders more visionary.","4","2021-02-17T17:14:34","0","t3_lkngg9"

*""Rio Tinto has already been very clear about no longer needing nor wanting the expense or the unreliability of the coal-fired power station.*

*It runs the energy-hungry Boyne Smelter in Gladstone and the Yarwun and Queensland alumina refineries nearby and is the biggest energy user in the state.*

*In March this year, the mining giant signed a massive solar and battery storage deal with Edify Energy to secure the future of the smelter and refineries, which are among the country’s biggest consumers of energy.""*

...just drives home how far renewables and battery storage have come.

However, when that tictac is emitting a significant amount of radiation that can be readily detected with specialised instruments the search suddenly becomes a lot easier. The main challenge is getting the right equipment into the right location and then thoroughly combing the route for radiation spikes.

Of course, this could be a lot more challenging if the source has gotten lodged in someone's tyre and tracked outside of the search zone on the highway. In fact at that point you'd either need to identify every vehicle that has transited the route and then inspect them, or set up radiation detection gateways and hope the vehicle in question passed through.","35","2023-01-30T12:02:49","1","t1_j6fqogz"

Radiation intensity decreases with distance, by square law. E.g. if you stand 2m away from the source, you recieve a quarter of the radiation (so 2.5 X-rays per hour at 2m). Double the distance again and it drops to a quarter of that. 

At 100m or so, the source is likely indistinguishable from background radiation. So we are probably looking at a 50m x 50m window to detect this source. 

This is also assuming that the radioactive source is not shielded in any way e.g. sand, rocks, car tyre, water source e.g. which would drop the radiation intensity significantly.

And then it’s recognition. To point out who did a trying great last shift.

And then you move into ‘The Shift Ahead’ where you have to type out Hazards and Controls alongside your given tasks handed out to you.

After that it is Safety Focus, where you choose a safety theme for the day and blah blah blah.

Fast forward a couple years, I still remember and apply a lot of things I heard on those “silly” safety shares, and I non-consciously always hold railings and don’t use my phone while taking the stairs.

Let me put it this way: Imagine a Chinese property developer wants to level Flagstaff Gardens and build office buildings on top of it, because the site is not of any living or archaeological significance to his people.

Several independent scientific teams analysed this area and these minerals, and all came to the conclusion that it can't be done without destroying the nature using the currently available technology. Those are university professors and experts from around the continent, and the only study that claims it can be done is the one funded by Rio Tinto.

The only reason why this project has been moving forward so far is that our government is corrupt.

So we are not some backwards people against progress and development. If this goes through, there won't be any land/water/air for us to enjoy any kind of income from lithium extraction. I prefer my land over any kind of economical progress in a toxic wasteland. To ""go green"" with lithium and electric cars, we need to destroy vast territories of forests, rivers, and fertile land. Not worth it.

Protesting against a mine in specific location is ok, if the reason is genuine threat to a fragile but important ecosystem. But being against all lithium mining as a default is 100% ideological, and:   


Ideological solutions to practical problems suck.  


Practical problem is that Europe needs batteries. Which means opening lithium mines in Europe. It is the price to pay if we want to keep using lithium batteries. Being against all mining is hypocritical and short sighted, and is based fully on ideology that can only stem from 1st world privilege. In practice we need batteries and if they are not mined in Europe then they will be mined elsewhere and we can't control those conditions. It is better to keep it close so we can do it properly and with minimal damage. Any enviroactivist that says ""no"" as a blanket rule is an idiot working against environmental goals, or has to admit that what they want means we will roll back technology.  


I live in an area with rich lithium deposit and i WANT the mine here. I'm fairly certain that a mine in Finland  is going to be better for the planet than a mine in some war torn country.

"4539","ma7efe5","1idvu1c","silraen","Vivo cá há uns anos, vivi no centro do Porto também. Prefiro de longe viver em Rio Tinto, apesar de ter algumas saudades do cerntro.

Vantagens:
- mais barato. Consegui comprar uma casa espaçosa em vez do apartamento minúsculo que o mesmo orçamento compraria no Porto. Os preços subiram muito, no entanto.
- muito sossegado. Os únicos barulhos que ouço são os cães dos vizinhos e ocasionais obras. 
- nada de trânsito nas imediações, uma paz.
- bons serviços. É fácil ir ao supermercado, tenho talho, farmácia e padaria à beira, etc etc
 - nada de turistas
- continuo a estar super perto do Porto, portanto consigo chegar rápido à cidade (especialmente de metro) e tenho acesso a uber eats, entregas, etc
- recolha do lixo funciona super bem
- o parque oriental da cidade é aqui ao lado e muito mais sossegado que o parque ocidental. Bom para fazer exercício e relaxar

Desvantagens:
- sinto algum isolamento, o meu grupo social está todo no Porto. Também é culpa minha porque não me esforcei muito ainda para me integrar em grupos ou atividades locais.
- ainda tenho de ir ao Porto para tudo o que é cultura/ diversão 
- a zona onde vivo (imediatamente à volta) é feia e demasiado acidentada para caminhar. Quando vivia no Porto tinha o hábito de dar umas voltas pelos arredores, aqui não. E andava muito mais a pé.
- péssimo centro de saúde, não atendem telefone nem respondem a emails e são super burocráticos. O pessoal médico/enfermagem é bom, mas aquilo é mais mal gerido que a TAP. A questão do centro de saúde é uma roleta russa, infelizmente, uns são bons, outros não. Este é pessimo.


No entanto, Rio Tinto é enorme e tem zonas e zonas. A minha não é a melhor em termos de transportes públicos, mas como trabalhamos a partir de casa não impacta muito e facilmente conseguimos deixar o carro no metro. É uma zona suuuuuper sossegada e segura. Putras zonas já são mais caóticas. Estuda bem a zona para onde vais. Caminha por lá, bebe um café na padaria da esquina, antes de decidires.","3","2025-02-01T02:09:22","0","t3_1idvu1c"

I will say you do see this in other sports a lot (normally after championship wins) where kids are with their parents on the field.

&gt; # [RIGI: la empresa Rio Tinto invertirá US$2500 millones en Salta para un proyecto de litio](https://resizer.glanacion.com/resizer/v2/la-empresa-rio-tinto-invertira-en-salta-para-un-SB6NR2HKJBAM5E524C7WLAHVRI.jpeg?auth=a3bf058960f92163430659ce98c243ee5b8840474d72a804e27286e987d2b13e&amp;width=1200&amp;quality=70&amp;smart=false&amp;height=800)

&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; La empresa **Rio Tinto** invertirá en la Argentina **US$2500 millones** para un proyecto de **litio**. Será en la provincia de **Salta**, donde se ubica una de las mayores reservas de ese metal del mundo. La compañía aprobó la inversión para ampliar el proyecto **Rincón en la Argentina**. Se trata de la primera operación de litio a escala comercial de la firma.
&gt; 
&gt; El anunció llega un par de meses después de la entrada en vigencia del **Régimen de Incentivo a las Grandes Inversiones (RIGI),** que estipula beneficios en el IVA y Ganancias, exenciones en derechos de importación y exportación para iniciativas cuyos montos mínimos oscilen entre US$200 millones y US$900 millones.
&gt; 
&gt; **Rincón en la Argentina** tiene unacapacidad de 60.000 toneladas de litio carbonato de alta calidad para **baterías** por año, incluye la **planta inicial de 3000 toneladas y la planta de expansión de 57.000 toneladas.** Está previsto que la vida útil sea de 40 años y que la construcción de la planta ampliada comience a mediados del 2025.
&gt; 
&gt; **En tanto se espera que la primera producción comience en el 2028,** seguida de tres años de aumento de actividades hasta alcanzar la máxima capacidad. La empresa asegura que como resultado se generarán **“una cantidad importante de puestos de trabajos y oportunidades económicas para las empresas locales”.**
&gt; 
&gt; Ubicado en el corazón del “**triángulo de litio”** en la Argentina, el proyecto consiste en la **extracción de salmuera** por medio de un área de pozos de producción e instalaciones de procesamiento y efluentes, al igual que su infraestructura asociada. Se utiliza tecnología de extracción directa de litio (DLE), un proceso que ayuda con la conservación del agua, reduce los efluentes y produce carbonatos de litio de manera más uniforme que otros métodos.
&gt; 
&gt; Según la firma, la inversión apoyará la actual ambición de la Argentina por convertirse en uno de los productores de litio más importantes del mundo.

Cuando empezo esa guerra, las potencias occidentales se dieron cuenta que no tenian suficiente producción de baterías, a diferencia de China, que le compra litio a Argentina, el cuarto productor de litio en el mundo. El kirchnerismo y China se llevaban tan bien que hasta los dejaron poner una base china en la Patagonia.

Y de golpe y porrazo, gana Milei y cambia la alineación del país. No más alianza con China, Rusia, Iran. Lula hace que Alberso nos meta en el BRICS antes de que asuma Milei, pero a Milei no le tiembla la mano cuando asume y nos saca de ahí.

Re loco, no? Comparen el estado de nuestra economía cuando Cristina y Alberso nos alinearon con China, Iran y Rusia con el estado de nuestra economía ahora. El peso pasó de ser la moneda que nadie quería a ser la que más se revalorizó en el mundo. 

Sumado a otras cosas turbias, como la muerte de Nisman el día antes de presentar pruebas relacionadas al Kirchnerismo e Iran, la bizarra relacion de D'Elia con Iran, esa base china en la Patagonia, me da mucha cosa pensar que hubiera pasado si ganaba Massa.

Bor se koristi u lekovima, ali i u solarnim panelima i u nanotehnologiji i očekuje se da će cena da raste kako raste potražnja za solarnim panelima. 

Cena je niska iz više razloga. Prvo, pukao je balon. Cena je skočila zbog spekulacije da će proizvodnja električnih automobila eksplodirati, što se nije desilo. Gomila proizvođača el. automobila je usporila proizvodnju. Generalno je kriza, pa je gomila ljudi i odustala od kupovine novih automobila. Drugo, otkriveni su drugi tipovi baterija koji ili koriste manje litijuma ili ga ne koriste uopšte. Ove tehnologije koje ga ne koriste uopšte još nisu komercijalne, a ove koje koriste manje litijuma se već proizvode.

Baterije zasnovane na natrijumu imaju manji kapacitet, ali su bezbednije i ne gube kapacitet na niskim temperaturama. Zato su odlične za skladištenje energije. Još se ne proizvode masovno, ali sama ideja je razbila balon litijuma.

Neka procena je da će natrijum da preuzme tržište jeftinih električnih automobila (kojima nije bitan kapacitet, kojima je ok i ispod 300km dometa), i tržište skladištenja energije, a da će litijum da ostane kao bolja opcija za skupe automobile (sa dometom preko 400km i mobilne uređaje (telefone, laptopove itd).","11","2024-01-23T03:27:12","0","t3_19cu130"

natrijum obecava ali sa osnovnim karakteritikama je losiji od litijuma. ali i pored losjih karakteristika sigurno ce naci primenu jer je mnogostruko jeftiniji i rasprostranjeniji.

sigurno ce se litijum puno koristiti i traziti narednih godina, nego je cena bila u ociglednom balonu i sada se normalizuje. gledajuci ovaj grafikon i dalje je cena visa nego pre korone....

"4765","kj3zjtj","19cu130","DrWwevox","Glavna stvar za razumeti jeste da istražni radovi koji dolaze pre iskopavanja traju godinama. Jadarit je poznat kao potencijalno isplativi resurs već dugo dugo vremena. Rio tinto kao kompanija vrši istražna bušenja dugo pre nego što su postali interesantni široj javnosti.

Strateški gledano, Kina je glavni uvoznik litijuma u Evropi, EU, koja želi da se osamostali u smislu resursa, traži potencijalne izvore unutar svog opsega uticaja. Kad se setimo da smo kandidati, nama se može nametnuti taj projekat kao vrsta ucene.

Razlozi za ne vršenje ovog projekta u ostatku Evrope su mnogobrojni. To što litijuma ima u Nemačkoj, Češkoj i sl. Ne znači da bi njegovo iskopavanje bilo isplativo. Od svih rudarsko istražnih projekata, izuzetno mali broj doživi da bude dokazan kao potencijalno isplativ, a još manji postane rudnik. Ali razlog za koji mogu da garantujem da nije uticao na ostale zemlje jeste ekološka zabrinutost. Ovde je prerada rude štetna, ne iskopavanje. Ruda se može iskopati na jednoj lokaciji, a prerađena na drugoj, naravno, ako ste orijentisani zaradi, cilj je da prerada bude na lokalitetu kako bi se smanjili troškovi. Dok se ne razviju tehnološki procesi koji ne zahtevaju žrtvovanje ekološke sredine, ovakav projekat neće zaživeti unutar EU, a ne bi trebao ni kod nas. Da ima načina da se jadarit iskopa, a da prerada ne bude štetna, onda da, nama bi bilo isto kao da smo našli zlato","0","2024-01-23T09:39:32","0","t3_19cu130"

taj smrad je bivši poslanik SNS-a

&gt; Na RTS-u je trenutno emisija koja treba da posluži informisanju javnog mnjenja o rudarenju litijuma. 
&gt; 
&gt; Neću ulaziti u to kako voditelj, kao i uvek, ima blago tendenciozna pitanja ili u to kako kad je profit privatne kompanije na meti RTS je spreman da bude njihov javni servis što godinama do sada fakat nije za svoje građane.
&gt; 
&gt; Najzanimljivije je to što 3/4 učesnika debate razgovaraju na osnovu svoje ekspertize, duboko ulazeći u podatke i trude se da potkrepe to što govore, bez obzira da li se ja sa tim slažem ili ne, osim jednog učesnika.
&gt; 
&gt; Taj jedan učesnik je bivši poslanik SNS-a koji osim što pokazuje retoriku svoje stranke pokazuje i njihov način učestvovanja u debati.
&gt; 
&gt; Do sada je:
&gt; 
&gt; - prekidao učesnike
&gt; - rekao učesnicima da nemaju pojma o čemu pričaju dok su objašnjavali materiju koju predaju pokušavajući da umanji ili napravi njihove brige bespredmetnim i nevažnim
&gt; - rekao da detalji nisu bitni kao ni cela studija kao ni Rio Tinto
&gt; - zaključio da su svi za litijum (i ako su ljudi jasno rekli da nisu za)

Rare earths seem likely to be the next lithium or nickel imo, another new market with lofty demand expectations and a wave of new supply emerging. Price crashes usually follow. I don't expect the native protests against their mill will come to much, but it's another risk in play. Processing tailings for secondary minerals isn't usually a big money-spinner, even when performed without moving materials incredible distances, and certainly not enough to rival a Rio Tinto for revenues, but I admit to not having read their economics much further than the broad strokes.","7","2024-10-17T10:12:48","0","t3_1g5c5pb"

Even if REE holds at its bear market values the deposit is worth over 1 Billion per year in profit for the next 40 years. REE valuation increase would just be extra torque. The ree values have already dumped 40% or more and are holding steady and rising again.

The native protesting is a risk but since it's the only working conventional mill and the Utah government has a hard on for nuclear power and the mineral industry along with the USFS confirming no safety concerns for the mill the protests of less than 1% of Utah's entire population isn't going mean much. Especially as nuclear power and a rare earth supply chain is sorely needed for the US as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions with China.

They may not hit RIOs valuation but with RIO being worth 107Bill in market cap hitting even 20% of that is a 20x gain and putting current shares at 120 a piece. I used RIO as a benchmark because of how UUUU is going about their multiple revenue streams for multiple radioactive minerals.

Ali ako ste lenji kao ja, evo TLDR by ChatGPT:

&gt;Istraživanje koje je sproveo BIRN pokazuje da je kompanija Rio Tinto kupila bar 5.78 hektara zemlje u okolini Loznice, iako je Vlada Srbije u januaru 2022. godine stopirala projekat Jadar i poništila sva dokumenta sa kompanijom. Prema informacijama koje su objavljene, Rio Tinto je potpisao bar sedam kupoprodajnih ugovora sa vlasnicima zemlje u selima Gornje Nedeljice i Slatina, i platio ukupno više od 1.2 miliona evra. Rio Tinto je takođe izjavio da nije odustao od projekta Jadar, a izvršni direktor Rio Tinto Ltd Džejkob Stausholm je na brifingu za investitore u decembru izjavio da ""Jadar"" predstavlja ""neverovatnu vrednost"" i da moraju da smisle kako da to urade. Međutim, Rio Tinto tvrdi da je otkup zemljišta samo nastavak ranije preuzetih obaveza kompanije Rio Sava koje se odnose na period pre nego što je Vlada Srbije u januaru 2022. godine stavila van snage akte za realizaciju projekta.

&gt;Predsednik Srbije Aleksandar Vučić je nakon pobede na parlamentarnim i predsedničkim izborima u aprilu 2022. godine, ponovio nekoliko puta da je obustavljanje Rio Tintovog projekta bila greška, a na godišnjoj konferenciji 4. januara ove godine, izrazio je žaljenje što nije omogućio referendum o projektu Rio Tinta, što je već ranije najavljivao. Rio Tinto podržava lokalni referendum, dok strahuje od nacionalnog referenduma.

&gt;U istraživanju se takođe navodi da je Rio Tinto dugo vremena pokušavao da dobije dozvolu za otvaranje rudnika litijuma i bora u Srbiji, međutim, projekat je nailazio na snažan otpor lokalnog stanovništva i ekoloških aktivista, koji su ukazivali na negativne posledice koje bi ovaj projekat mogao imati na životnu sredinu i zdravlje ljudi.","35","2023-02-24T20:26:30","0","t3_11amuka"

Izjava direktora Rio TInta:

_Rio Tinto želju da „oživi“ projekat ne krije. Izvršni direktor Rio Tinto Ltd Džejkob Stausholm u decembru na brifingu za investitore u Sidneju je izjavio da „Jadar“ predstavlja „neverovatnu vrednost“.
„Moramo da smislimo kako da to uradimo. Jedino što bih danas rekao je da nismo odustali“_

Imaju dogovor sa slovenackim InoBat-om.
Hoce stabilan lanac prozivodnje litijumskih baterija za EU.

Vlada Srbije je 20. januara 2022. donela uredbu kojom je prestalo važenje Uredbe o utvrđivanju prostornog plana područja posebne namene za realizaciju projekta “Jadar“.

Vlada je krajem tog meseca poništila i rešenje Ministarstva zaštite životne sredine kojim se određuje obim i sadržaj studije o proceni uticaja na životnu sredinu Rio Tintovog rudnika.

Raspuštena je i Radna grupa za implementaciju projekta u kojoj su bili predstavnici kompanije, vlade Srbije, kao i dva saradnika predsednika Vučića – šef njegovog kabineta Ivica Kojić, i specijalni savetnik Danilo Cicmil.

**Međutim, upravni postupak povodom zahteva Rio Tinta za odobrenje „eksploatacionog polja br.3“ koji se odnosi na projekat Jadar, a koji je firma podnela još 6. januara 2021, još uvek je “u toku“. Ministarstvo rudarstva je to potvrdilo u zvaničnom odgovoru Udruženju Marš sa Drine u oktobru prošle godine.**","8","2023-02-25T00:22:15","0","t3_11amuka"

"4885","fukyktr","h7hhjj","sltfc","Essendon star Joe Daniher has called on the AFL to hold itself and its sponsors to a ""higher standard"" amid criticism of the league's partnerships with Rio Tinto and BHP after the destruction of ancient Indigenous heritage sites.

As players around the competition join in pre-match gestures in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, the AFL has been accused of not walking the talk on racism by associating with the mining giants, who have been at the centre of a national outcry this week.

Rio Tinto knowingly destroyed two 46,000-year-old caves in Western Australia's Pilbara region last month. BHP this week halted plans to blow up at least 40 Indigenous heritage sites after The Guardian revealed the company was fully aware of their significance and that the traditional owners of the land were opposed to the move.

The AFL has a long-standing partnership with Rio Tinto, which underwrites a variety of Indigenous football programs - including the Flying Boomerangs, whose players inspired Adam Goodes to perform a 'war cry' during a match against Carlton in 2015. BHP, meanwhile, signed an estimated $5 million deal with the AFL this year to sponsor the AFLW.

Daniher said all major organisations, including the AFL, had a role to play in shaping the future and responding to some of the ""delicate issues"" that have arisen around the world in recent weeks.

""We need to hold the industry that I'm in, the AFL, accountable to the change we want to see and the partners they choose to partner with to a higher standard,"" he told the Herald.

""And the people within those organisations need to be held to a higher standard to make meaningful change. We're quite good as an industry at using our voice for positive change ... [but] if we're going to see long-lasting, systemic change, there needs to be a higher standard that we as an industry hold ourselves accountable to.""

Daniher said relying solely on Indigenous people to highlight instances of discrimination was no longer good enough.

""We need non-Indigenous Australians standing up and speaking about what change needs to happen, and aligning with Indigenous Australians about what that looks like and how that shapes up,"" he said.

Former Big Bash League cricketer, deputy CEO of AIME Mentoring and human rights activist Ben Abbatangelo wrote an open letter to AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan earlier this week - which he posted on Instagram, and was 'liked' by Goodes - calling on the league to immediately sever ties with the mining company.

In the AFL's apology to Goodes last year, McLachlan said the competition had ""pledged to continue to fight all forms of racism and discrimination, on and off the field.""

https://www.instagram.com/p/CBNZx4Lg5zW/

Abbatangelo said the AFL's stance against racism was ""merely performative if they and their partners do not listen to and respect Indigenous people"".

""If you do care and you mean what you say, you've got to start acting,"" he told the Herald.

""You can't say you're going to fight all forms of racism and discrimination and then partner with BHP and Rio Tinto. [The AFL] haven't been very good at uprooting systemic racism. In fact they've perpetuated it with partnerships that don't align with their stance on racism.

""Players can take a knee - it's symbolically nice but Aboriginal people are still living in poverty, still not recognised constitutionally, still don't have any autonomy or self-determination to design our realities and our futures.

""This sense of hopelessness stems from the ongoing environmental racism and displacement from traditional lands. Now is the time for the institutions to meet their words with actions.""

A spokesperson for the AFL said the league had spoken to Rio Tinto and ""expressed our distress"" over the damage caused by their actions in the Pilbara, but said both the sponsorship and the connected Indigenous programs would continue.

""Rio has apologised for the distress they have caused and they know how much work they need to do with traditional owners to listen and learn while undertaking a review of their practices and processes and will fully co-operate with a parliamentary review into these matters,"" the spokesperson said.

On the player-led protests across the AFL in support of Black Lives Matter, the spokesperson said: ""The players and clubs, along with the AFL, are in no doubt about how critical these issues are. The players' voices and their leadership are heard and embraced across the code and we fully support them, agree with them and stand with them in the fight against racism.""","47","2020-06-12T19:31:37","0","t3_h7hhjj"

But pretty much every interview these days is a behavioural interview. Especially at Rio or BHP.

Example question might be “Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult team member.”

Using the STAR response would be something like:
Situation - during 3rd your we had a group assignment to design a solar powered vehicle
Task - Jimmy Bob was assigned responsibility for looking after designing the doors but wasn’t turning up to group meetings.
Action - Jane Blogs and I went and found him at the social club and had a long conversation about responsibility and that he was letting the team down. We explained that he needed to have the door design done by Friday or we were going to have to speak to the lecturer.
Response - Lazy Bones McGee thanked us for being so honest with him and apologised for letting us down. Everyone at the social club stood up and clapped and L.B. McGee went straight home and finished the door design that night.

I haven’t had a job interview for years but when preparing I usually just write out as many examples as I have of when I have faced a challenge  that I have overcome or performed well at something or whatever. Then just figure out what applies to whatever question they ask. Don’t feel awkward about taking some time to compose your thoughts and think of a good example.

South Australia already has negative power prices during the day sometimes, once the rest of the grid transitions the smelter will actually be paid money to use and store energy during some parts of the day, very cost effective way of making a previously very energy expensive product.","41","2025-03-14T12:50:24","0","t3_1jasox5"

There argument is that it's bad for wildlife and ""looks bad"".

Aluminium smelters really can't shut off due to the cells freezing and lowering the current isn't easy due to heat balance issues like it is with zinc electrowinning. 

The Gladstone smelter uses the most electricity in the country and is Rio Tintos biggest CO2 contributor. The solar panels are nice but won't offset the smelters electricity usage by more than a fraction of a percent. But as my old boss at the smelter said you have to remember that aluminium is a lot lighter than steel and a lot of that aluminium goes into cars made in Asia. So with that regard the smelter does offset some of its own CO2 production across the world.","3","2025-03-14T19:38:53","1","t1_mhoe4dq"

While solar is great, at the moment there is a concern of ""too much solar"" into the grid without infrastructure upgrades. I hope the power company does what they do in NZ and at points where there is ""too much power"" being generated, allow for free electricity hours. People plan their washing/drying/baking and other high power demand tasks around these free energy times. Better grid stability and reduces consumer prices. 


The choice of using battery is good as it will reduce evening power consumption, especially for the point straight after dark which is one of the higher energy demand points for residents. It all helps to improve grid stability and reduce need for additional power generation for peak points.","1","2025-03-16T07:16:21","0","t3_1jasox5"

Não é um sítio muito bonito, estamos a falar da fronteira entre o Porto e Gondomar, uma zona um pouco esquecida em termos urbanísticos, como são muitos outros arrabaldes do Porto.

Quanto ao Cerco, não te preocupes muito, parece próximo, mas na realidade está suficientemente afastado para não ser tema.

Uma vantagem dessa zona, é a grande oferta de transportes públicos, porque é uma zona de confluència dos autocarros que vêm de Rio Tinto, Valongo, Gondomar e São Pedro da Cova, em direcção ao centro do Porto, para além dos que circulam na Circunvalação. É verdade que não tens metro, mas as estações do Estádio do Dragão, Contumil e Levada estão a poucos minutos, viajando de autocarro.

When it comes to group activities - they are watching to see how you work in a team and communicate. Health and Safety is another big one and the importance of it in the workplace. Also it doesn’t hurt to take a notebook either. Good luck!","2","2025-07-21T18:42:00","0","t3_1m4m54v"

It is entirely about studying the dynamic of the team.

I mean, still try in earnest to achieve the best outcome.

What they want to know is: Who ignores the safety rules? Who doesn’t listen to their team? Who sits quietly and doesn’t really interact? Who leads by example? Who bosses everyone around?

Absolutely follow the safety/PPE rules, even if they seem ridiculous. Absolutely speak up to encourage your team members to do the same. If you’re not the sort to lead, don’t, but find ways to engage and be helpful.","2","2025-07-24T12:27:18","0","t3_1m4m54v"

&gt; Belgrade - Hundreds of environmental protesters blocked roads in Belgrade and other Serbian towns on Saturday, angered at mining giant Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s plans to extract lithium in the Balkan nation.

&gt; &amp;quot;I am here because I don&amp;#039;t want them to sell off the land of my ancestors. Serbia is not for sale,&amp;quot; one of the protesters, Milan Milosavljevic, a 31-year-old musician, told AFP. Protesters also blocked roads in several other Serbian towns, including Novi Sad in the north, central Kragujevac, Sabac in the northwest and the western town of Valjevo, according to the N1 television channel.

&gt; The company intends to invest $2.4 billion in the project, according to Vesna Prodanovic, director of Rio Sava, Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s sister company in Serbia.
