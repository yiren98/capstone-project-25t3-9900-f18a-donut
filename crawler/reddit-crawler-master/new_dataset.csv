58,Global,2024-10,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto ($RIO)-TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share. Hi Everyone, As I’m sure everyone and their wives' boyfriends saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining U stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher. Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year. Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operation Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later. That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If They were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently. Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD. Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 2, 3 4+ Billion USD per year for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects). Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining. I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell. The company current has 200 million in liquid cash right now, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand. Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam. Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen (NXE) deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO), specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto. Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište. Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga? Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi. Rimljani su isto tu napravili prokop (da bi prenosili rude do Sasa, to prokopište se i dalje nalazi tu i vidi lepo).

102,Global,2025-04,"RVSN 20-F Breakdown: Israel Railways, Rio Tinto, and What’s Coming in 2025-Hello everyone, i’m writing this post to help clarify some of the doubts and hopefully stir the conversation down a better path. This post will surely get a lot of hate, but i see a lot of uninformed people spreading FUD either cause they lost money or want to troll. Hopefully this helps anyone that’s serious about their investment and needs some reassurance. The main thing that’s caused some confusion is the fact that most people only read or know about the 6-K and not the 20-F. The 6-K is only a summary of the 20-F that’s published in a PR format for easier reading. Depending on the company, you can find future guidance and some of the juicier things in the 6-K, but that wasn’t the case for us. My aim with this post is to provide information on some of the things we’ve found in the 20-F that might be unknown to some of you. Credits go to u/maxchris \- u/Drett92 \- u/Time_Shoulder_1493 \- u/Wreckologyyy \- u/mr_super_saiyan_g - u/Sunvmikey #Israel Railways https://preview.redd.it/ckkaybqp18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5433734f83f77b64486a1ca734513c90c0cb4d This excerpt highlights the current stage of their deal with Israeli Railways and what we can expect to come from them in the future. A lot people assumed that they were already paid for the 10 Main Line systems from January 31st 2023, but from our understanding based on this screenshot, seems like they’re still owed the majority of this amount once they finish installing the last of the systems. We suspect it took them this long because they needed to be certified first before installing their tech on passenger units, there isn’t much information on that currently. https://preview.redd.it/fjbjikfh18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9d92ee654dfb023b4f432592844da0de5d980e As you can see this one is a bit different and goes into detail of just how huge this deal could be for Rail Vision in the near future. They have a long history working together and this is Rail Vision’s turf so i wouldn’t be surprised if this is where they get their first “big” contract. Installing their tech on 300 trains and possibly doubling that to 600 units for bidirectional functionality is a massive opportunity. At this stage, their tech would be recognized as successful and profitable for the business and would also help attract further interest from outside parties. #Rio Tinto Iron Core https://preview.redd.it/6yffowta18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ed7b31d07138242a535c6677912b4e65a0a480 This is a big one, a lot of us rightfully assumed that Rio Tinto was dead in the water so this is new to us and very important. From what we can read here, this deal is very similar to the one from India. Rail Vision signed a supply agreement with Hitachi Rail STS to provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing. The pilot ended in August 2022 and since then we haven’t heard anything from them. The thing is that they stopped testing altogether, they haven’t done pilots with any other company since then. It seems that they’ve been reviewing the data gathered by us and they’ve been planning the next phase to possibly procure our tech. This is evident now that they’re releasing tenders in Q2 2025 and Rail Vision is participating. Nothing is publicly confirmed as of yet, but this could be an unexpected catalyst before EOY. #Existing Pilots https://preview.redd.it/pnygldc818se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76e1af49c244af41f9f2e0bd98859cad235cc60d From this paragraph right here we get a bit more information on how it is that they roll out their units for pilot testing. So first it mentions how they have multiple pilots running at the same time, these are the ones from North America, Central America, India and presumably South America with Vale. Most of these pilots started around the same time in 2024 and based on current data, we can expect these to finish by mid 2025. #Financials - Balance Sheet and Runway As of Dec 2024, Rail Vision had $17.5M in cash, up from $3.3M the year prior. This comes from $24.1M in gross raised through private placements, warrant exercises, and the equity line. With operating cash burn at $9.7M for 2024, they currently have about 1.5 to 2 years of runway if spending remains the same, more if pilot contracts convert and revenue goes up. That gives them time to push pilots into rollouts without needing to dilute. #Research and Development (RnD) https://preview.redd.it/rfwlwmzy08se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d0bdb1e50f461ca93e9ae3f45c94af45f3c861 Rail Vision’s RnD expenses for the year 2024 were $5.28 million, down from $7.15 million in 2023. This shows a 26% decrease YoY. From this paragraph we can see they reduced their RnD team by 12 employees and spent less on equipment and materials. This is a positive sign as they’re phasing out of the heavy RnD phase, we should expect this trend to continue for future reports. Additionally there are some things i found regarding what they’re currently working on when it comes to RnD. These include: Maintenance and Predictive Maintenance, Data Services and Mapping. #Operating Loss https://preview.redd.it/gu1vpv4218se1.jpg?width=1256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fbdf2cc8a217656ba9bfc59702ed17435be57a Rail Vision reported an operating loss of $9 million which is an improvement from the $11.4 million in 2023. This is a 21% reduction YoY. The two main reasons for this reduction are the reduced expenses from RnD which are down $1.87 million and also the higher revenue generated of $1.3 million. Again, we can expect these figures to get better and better in future reports. They’re improving on operational efficiency and they’re proving that they know what they’re doing when it comes to the management of their finances. If the prior pilots convert to full contracts in 2025 then we can expect profitability by H2 2025. #Opportunity Roadmap https://preview.redd.it/74ivfo3k28se1.jpg?width=1312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57300b1f6ccef324b2026d92aec25bbd92bd2d2f Also wanted to share a roadmap from u/Time_Shoulder_1493, i think its a good visual to show all of the active pilots and everything else Rail Vision is working on. #Closing Remarks In my own personal opinion, this ER is exactly what we expected. There isn’t any surprises when it comes to their financials, they’re reducing expenses by cutting their biggest spender which is RnD and growing their revenue through multiple clients. I believe this will only get better with time as they finish the current pilots and start gaining contracts. If these contracts come to fruition then i expect profitability by H2 2025. I know this is a very difficult time we’re going through and the lack of transparency from management only makes it worse. I believe that the general feeling we’re all experiencing could’ve been avoided if only they communicated with us. The good thing is that they’re working, they have presence in multiple countries and there’s potential contracts in the near future. They seem optimistic about what could possibly happen this year and they’re probably getting promising feedback from their pilots. For now i’ll remain patient and look forward to H1 2025.",Reddit

I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients. PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day: [You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… # Big. # Fucking. # Deal. To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp. * First they ignore you. * Then they laugh at you. * Then they fight you. * Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries. * Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond. It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world. If they’re in, I’m in. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Table of Contents:** 1.

Musings on Earnings and Unlocking \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee. You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. Why? I like the stock, a lot. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day** Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up: &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07 Four things stood out to me: **Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient. The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/) Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day. I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult. **Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc. The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. **Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force **DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval: https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism: * Slow down 15-20% * Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon * For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points * Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic * Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations * Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation: &gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way* &gt; &gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students* &gt; &gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.* &gt; &gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.* I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power. \_\_\_\_\_ **#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit** One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots. No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK). Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical...[Content truncated]",Reddit

Za one koji nemaju volje i vremena za to, ukratko cu izneti bitne zakljucke. Studije i analize koje je iznela kompanija Rio Tinto su Teorijski izvodljive. kada bi stvari gledali teoretski. Svaki rudnik ima odrdjen uticaj na zivotnu sredinu, samo je pitanje koliko. S obzirom da je Jadar veliki Rudnik,ne kao Bor, ali odredjena kontaminacija bi sigurno postojala. Zbog toga se svi rudnici Litijuma u svetu nalaze u industrijskim zonama i u nenaseljenim mestima, kako bi sve bilo pogodno za eksploataciju. Dubina na kojoj se nalazi ruda je na 350m do 700m ispod povrsine zemlje, sto je dobro sa ekoloskog aspekta jer se ne radi o povrsinskom kopu. Litijum se u svetu masovno proizovdi iz minerala spodumena i taj mineral ima istu kolicinu litijuma kao jadarit, s tim sto jadarit ima i natrijum i bor i silicijum, a spodumen se sastoji od litijuma, silicijuma i aluminijuma pa kada se izdvoji Litijum ostaje alumosilikat koji nije opasan po zivotnu sredinu. Tako da bi se morao resavati i problem bora i natrijuma. Jadarit je i otkriven tako sto se trazio bor, ali trenutno potraznja za borom i bornim jedinjenjima kao prozivodima trenutno nema komercijalnu vrednost, a to potvrdjuje i podatak da Rio Tinto u rudnicima u Kaliforniji poseduje rezerve Bora koji je ostao u otpadu. Na sadasnjem nivou razvoja tehnologije jos nije izveden proces razdvajanja litijuma od bora bez velike kolicine bora kao otpada i to bi bio novi tehnoloski proces koja se planira u Jadru. Kolicina Sumporne kiseline da bi se razlozio Jadarit je 943tona dnevno, koje bi se dovozile u Jadar narednih 10000dana, koliko iznosi period eksploatacije litijuma u Jadru. Jedne od najvecih rezervi pijacih podzemnih voda se nalaze u Macvi, na 15km od rudnika, postoje brojni rizici kontaminacije tih voda, mogucnost poplava,stvaranja pukotina u vodonepropusnim stenama usled sleganja tla. Rio Tinto je u svojoj studiji naveo da ce ceo rudnik biti podignut iznad nivoa poplavnog talasa iz 2014. godine tako sto ce podici ceo plato rudnika za 4m na POVRSINI OD 220 HEKTARA. Kako? Odluka ce na kraju biti politicka.",Reddit

155,Global,2024-10,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto-TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share. Hi Everyone, As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher. Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year. Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later. That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently. Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD. Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects). I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell. The company currently has 200 million in liquid cash, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales. Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam. Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium...[Content truncated]",Reddit

Representative Adam Smith described continuing challenges on the matter in a press briefing on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, where he’s leading the [first](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/china-hosts-us-house-group-as-tiktok-trade-talks-gain-momentum) official visit by US House lawmakers since 2019 as relations steady before a [potential meeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/xi-asks-trump-to-avoid-taking-restrictive-trade-measures-in-call) between the countries’ presidents. **“I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question,” Smith said, without specifying what the sticking points are. “I think that that still needs to be worked on.”** China dominates the global supply and processing of the minerals, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. Beijing has used its position as a [strategic lever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/china-deploys-rare-earths-as-weapon-in-trade-war-with-trump) as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalated earlier this year. The two governments reached a framework agreement in June that includes a [Chinese commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-27/china-says-it-confirms-trade-framework-details-with-us) to review applications for shipping rare earth magnets, although few details of the deal have been disclosed. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last week said supplies to his country had “bounced back up significantly,” although European companies have complained about [shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-rare-earth-product-exports-hit-highest-since-at-least-2012) that threaten to halt production. Smith also struck a note of caution in response to a reporter’s question about whether Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. will have any role in maintaining the app’s algorithm in the US. Citing privacy and security concerns, he said the matter has “not been 100% resolved,” while adding that he wasn’t privy to the negotiations. The US and China are nearing an agreement to hive off the US operations of social media platform TikTok to a consortium that includes software giant Oracle Corp. Under the spin-off arrangement being discussed, TikTok will be majority-owned and controlled by Americans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Many of the finer details of the agreement have yet to be made public. Joined by US Ambassador to China David Perdue, the delegation’s visit may build more goodwill ahead of a possible sitdown between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in South Korea. The world’s two largest economies are in the [final stages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/us-china-talks-for-huge-boeing-aircraft-order-in-final-stages) of negotiations for a “huge” Boeing Co. aircraft order, Perdue said at the briefing. Such a deal, which has been years in the making, would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two nations but has been contingent on an easing in tensions. On the security front, Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged Beijing to engage in talks over its “rapidly growing nuclear arsenal” to prevent miscalculation. “When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation about it to make sure that we understand each other,” Smith said. He stressed the need for better military-to-military dialogue, a message he delivered in meetings with Chinese officials including Premier Li Qiang since the delegation arrived on Sunday. During the trip, the US delegation has also discussed the flow of fentanyl and called for fair [access](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/us-lawmakers-call-for-more-defense-talks-in-rare-china-visit) to China’s market for US firms.

An Australian delegation of critical minerals companies visited Washington and New York last week to meet senior administration officials and investors. ASX-listed firms including Australian Strategic Materials [(ASM.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ASM.AX), Ionic Rare Earths [(IXR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IXR.AX), and International Graphite [(IG6.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IG6.AX) are looking to expand in the U.S., company executives told Reuters. The scale of the U.S. customer base is a major attraction, they said, given its rapidly developing electric vehicle, defence, and advanced manufacturing industries, as well as cheap energy and the hefty subsidies it is set to deploy. ""We've identified six states as ones that we're looking at seriously,"" said Chief Legal Officer Annaliese Eames of ASM, which is seeking to expand beyond its rare earths metallization plant in Korea. Of those states, ASM, an $85 million firm, is conducting detailed due diligence, including reviewing sites, in Oklahoma and South Carolina. What drew ASM to the U.S. was more than strong federal and state support and incentives. ""It's the commitment that they're making to grow the entire ecosystem,"" she said. Some critical minerals firms that supply to customers in defense need to locate nearby for reasons of national security and the series of complex steps in turning raw materials into magnets used in everything from wind power to missiles. That is the case for Ionic Rare Earths, which is planning to replicate the magnet recycling technology it has developed in Belfast in several U.S. states, including Tennessee, where it is in advanced discussions, Managing Director Tim Harrison said. ""There are a number of other states that can provide very low cost of power... They also have a lower labor cost base and they have both federal and state governments that are willing to deploy immense funding,"" he told [Reuters.International](http://Reuters.International) Graphite, which is building an advanced processing plant in Western Australia, is also looking at options to build in the U.S. and Europe, to be more closely aligned to the specific requirements of its customers, CEO Andrew Worland said. China's restrictions on rare earths exports [in April](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) galvanized the U.S. to supercharge its rare earths industry, and higher Western world prices that have emerged are attracting investors and greasing the wheels of project finance. Even so, acess to U.S. funding is expected to be highly competitive. Australia's Lynas Rare Earths [(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), the biggest supplier outside China, warned last month that its heavy rare-earths processing plant in Texas may not go ahead after the Trump administration provided multibillion dollar funding to its U.S. rival. # POLICY CHALLENGES The trend highlights critical policy challenges in Australia that are impeding the government's ambition to develop new export markets beyond its mainstay fossil fuels. That opportunity was worth A$170 billion ($112 billion) to its economy by 2040, according to a PwC report as recently as 2023.""Australia has been struggling to set up the critical minerals industry beyond primary extraction,"" PwC Australia chief economist Amy Lomas said. Australia's high power and labor costs, and a cumbersome approvals process, are dragging on growth and diminishing the country's international competitiveness, major miners regularly [complain](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bhp-flags-organic-copper-growth-us-allure-silent-big-buyouts-2025-09-15/). Meanwhile, advanced manufacturing is still a small sector, its development clipped by the closure of Australia's car industry in the 2010s.""For an Australian company to look at building it in Australia, where do we sell our materials?

But even more important — it explicitly cites the **$10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp)** in August to accelerate domestic scandium production. Here’s why it matters: under **DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement)**, U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) *must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources* for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a **stopgap**, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. **NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap**, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement might be coming in November. # ⚡Bottom line: The DLA just telegraphed demand urgency. Rio fills a short-term gap, but NioCorp is the domestic structural answer, and defense primes will need its scandium + ScAl alloys for compliance.

170,Global,2025-04,"Rio Tinto u Bosni-Copy-paste mog posta na r/bih: Rodom sam iz Srebrenice. Retko dolazim, ali kad i dođem, uvek odem do Gubera (nekadašnjeg lokaliteta banje Guber). To je pravo čudo prirode: zemljište je obogaćeno kojekakvim rudama (izvinite, ne znam pravi izraz za to), vode koje protiču kroz samu banju su lekovite zbog tih ruda, sama korita/izvorišta su crvene boje, vazduh je neverovatno kvalitetan, itd itd. E pa, danas sam otišla do gore, i čuvena očna voda jedva kaplje. Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto. Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište. Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga? Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi.

Pratico normalmente no solinca arrabida mas ja fui ao gaiashopping, dragao e uma vez ao classic da maia todos eles muito semelhantes sendo o dragao de facto o melhor (sei que levou um upgrade) todos eles justificam o preço acima da media. Porem decidi ir ao de rio tinto recentemente e fiquei pasmado com a diferença para os outros. A area de musculação é minúscula (apenas uma rack/bench de cada???) e a idade de certas maquinas (as smith parecem da guerra do ultramar). Se fosse franchising ate entendia mas sendo todos geridos pelo mesmo grupo acho que o solinca poderia investir mais neste local visto a falta de ginasios em rio tinto e o preço obviamente (quase 60 por qualidade de vivagym). Deu me vibes do ginasio que frequentava na minha terrinha quando era adolescente a diferença é que pagava 15 euros por mes e nao 60. Espero que ele sofra um upgrade pois fica me mais perto do que o dragao ou gaia mas no estado atual mesmo a horas mortas é dificil fazer um bom treino. Sei que alguns dos que mencionei sao ex holmes palace e bastante mais recentes (menos de 1 ano etc) mas a diferença é noite e dia.",Reddit

202,Global,2025-01,"Rio De Janeiro is not for the faint of heart!-The streets are flooded with Bodybuilders and ridiculously good looking men. Sure there are unfit tourists but most locals have rock hard abs and humongous muscles. Imagine an average looking guy like me (178cm height, 15% bodyfat, skinny af, average face) would feel like. Getting mogged by like 9/10 men walking up and down the street. What does all this equate to you may ask? How would people react when they see someone who doesn’t exactly “fit the scene” so to speak. As a “non beach hunk” you’re 100% invisible to the women. I would cold approach hundreds everyday for weeks in places like Copacabana and Ipanema. Even in Lapa I tried. I got the same answer every single time: I’m married/ I have a boyfriend. And if there were single women they usually give an explanation on why they’re not looking to date. As a normal guy I don’t recommend Rio. I’m leaning to a small town in Colombia for dating and relationships if that’s your whole intention. Otherwise it’s a terrific city with a lot of tourist attractions and I did enjoy the surfing activity and beach soccer. But the whole cold approach factor was quite disappointing. I mean, you can’t even use your social status (being American) to generate a tiny bit of interest in people. It’s not like Thailand/Philippines where being American is “exotic” lol Also, for some reason everyone is sick with a cold/flu. People coughing everywhere. Wear a mask!",Reddit

208,Global,2025-09,"Why do foreigners romanticize Rio de Janeiro so much?-I’ve noticed that many foreigners, especially Europeans, tend to romanticize Rio de Janeiro a lot. Many dream of living there, even though most Brazilians themselves wouldn’t necessarily choose Rio as their ideal place to live. It almost feels like a “Paris effect,” where the city’s global image sometimes overshadows its realities. But unlike Paris, Rio doesn’t really hide its contradictions, beauty and problems exist side by side. What’s also interesting is that Brazil has been breaking records in international tourism lately. According to recent data, Rio alone saw a 51% increase in foreign visitors compared to last year. The city’s international appeal seems stronger than ever, even though locals often see it with more caution. Even among my own European friends, I’ve noticed a shift: instead of planning a Eurotrip or the classic “European summer,” many now dream of spending their summer in Rio, treating it like their own version of a “Euro summer.” Honestly, I find this surprising. Why do you think foreigners romanticize Rio so much? Is it the beaches, the Carnival, the landscapes, or the “myth” of Brazilian lifestyle? And if you’ve been there, how did reality compare to your expectations?",Reddit

240,Global,2025-08,"We tried to skip the cable car line in Rio… ended up needing rescue-There are things one thinks, “that will never happen to me.” For example: I’ll never be left abandoned at sea, adrift; I’ll never be shipwrecked on a deserted island; or I’ll never get lost in the forest. Especially with that last one, whenever I saw in a movie or TV show that someone got lost in the woods, I always thought that could never happen to me. I have a good sense of direction, I consider myself capable, I simply didn’t understand how someone couldn’t retrace their steps back to the starting point. Well, that overconfidence landed me in one of those situations I thought would never happen to me: getting lost in a forest. Well, not exactly a forest, it was the Morro da Urca, a hill in Rio de Janeiro right next to one of the city’s most famous peaks, Sugarloaf Mountain. It was a short but terrible experience that left me with a good story to tell and feeling a bit humiliated. To explain what happened, I need to start with how the day began. It was a Thursday, and my wife and I decided to visit Sugarloaf Mountain, which is a hill on the bay of Rio de Janeiro. The way to get there is by cable car from the Bondinho Park. From there, the cable car takes you to the first station on Morro da Urca, a smaller hill right next to Sugarloaf. At the top of that hill, there’s a restaurant, some shops, and the next cable car station that takes you up to Sugarloaf itself. We did the whole tour, walking through the viewpoints, taking pictures, and having a good day. By sunset, we came down from Sugarloaf to Morro da Urca (the first hill) for an event they host on certain days, where a DJ mixes dance music as the sun goes down. The event lasted till about 6:00 p.m., when it was already dark. Both hills and the park close at 8:00 p.m. Suddenly, everyone wanted to go down on the cable cars, and the line was massive. My wife and I decided to wait a while, having a couple of beers while the line shrank. But an hour later, it was even longer. I estimated, without exaggerating, that standing in line would take nearly two hours. Another 30 minutes passed, and the line seemed to have grown even more. We couldn’t believe so many people were still trying to go down. Then we noticed a group of about six people heading toward a trail to go down. Turns out there’s a hiking trail down the hill. At the moment, it seemed like a good idea. I thought we could skip the line and be at the bottom in 20–30 minutes, it would even be a small adventure. Big mistake. I asked the guard at the trail exit, and he said we had to go to an office and sign a liability waiver, releasing the park from any responsibility if something happened to us on the trail. Of course, what could happen? We signed it, came back, and by then there was no one else going that way. My wife and I were the only ones. The guard calmly led us to the gate, opened it, we walked through, he wished us good night, closed the gate behind us, and left. I have to say, the casual attitude of everyone, the waiver office lady, the guard, fed my confidence that this would be an easy walk down. I’ve hiked other trails before, and while some are tiring, they’ve never been a big deal. So between my usual overconfidence and the staff’s attitude, I thought, “No problem. In 20 minutes we’ll be down, and it’ll have been a mini adventure.” I turned on my iPhone flashlight since the trail was completely dark, and off we went. Well, the trail kept getting narrower and steeper until we reached a point where I wasn’t sure we were even on the trail anymore. After trying to continue in a few different directions, it was clear we were no longer on the right path, maybe 20 minutes had passed. We decided to retrace our steps back to the park entrance, and that’s when the fear of feeling lost began, because going back, we couldn’t find the starting point. It seems impossible, and whoever reads this might think we’re idiots, but really, several factors contribute to getting you disoriented. It wasn’t our first time hiking, but it’s shocking how quickly we got lost. After a while of not being able to find the entrance, I told my wife our only option was to try to go down somehow, no matter what. By then I was getting really nervous because the park must have been closing, and we couldn’t hear any noise in the distance. My phone had about 25% battery, my wife’s only 5%. Just like in a movie. What followed were about two hours of false trails, arguing among ourselves in the darkness: “It’s this way!” “No, it’s that way!” “We came from there!” “No, we didn’t!” “We already passed this log.” “No, we didn’t.” Every tree looked the same, every trunk the same, every plant the same. The vegetation was dense, we couldn’t see the moon, we couldn’t see city lights because of the dense vegetation, the terrain was steep, everything was slanted —it’s a hill after all— and we only had an iPhone flashlight. “This can’t be,” I thought. “We can’t be lost. We’re in a city, not a real forest. Civilization is only 600 or 700 meters away. (About 2,000–2,300 feet)” And for those who know Morro da Urca or at least have seen pictures, you might say, “It’s just a hill, how could you get lost there?” Well, it’s not a small hill. From a distance it looks small, but in reality, it’s quite large. I couldn’t find the exact surface area of Morro da Urca, but together with Sugarloaf, they cover 91.5 hectares (roughly 226 acres). Morro da Urca is 220 meters high (about 720 feet), and the trail, I googled later —idiot—, is 1.5 kilometers long (just under a mile), but normally takes about 45 to 60 minutes. So it’s not like getting lost on a tiny hill. [The small buildings at the bottom of this illustration are around 7 to 8 stories high. This pic won't show the dimension but gives you a slight idea of the geography there.](https://preview.redd.it/la5g8v2j4rkf1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50d3ce9a5826d4701ddbb77a6f08b0cc08f8c405) You might also think: “It’s a hill, just walk in any direction until you reach the bottom.” Logical, right? Except that when we tried, all we found were cliffs, ravines, or vegetation so dense we couldn’t pass. A fun fact I discovered: the hill is full of thorny plants… and I was wearing shorts. We reached a point where we couldn’t go any further, every path seemed harder, it was pitch dark, the phone batteries were running low, and reality set in: yes, we were lost. Yes, we needed to be rescued somehow. [One would think it's just a trail down a hill, well it's not that small of a hill nor a trail.](https://preview.redd.it/clvq8z6d5rkf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a739288f4c8421df19448a29d4c063473eaa7e4) My wife had the very obvious idea—which hadn’t even occurred to me—of shouting for help. In Spanish (we’re Mexican), in English, in Portuguese, she shouted at the top of her lungs. Reflecting on that later, I realized why I hadn’t thought of it: I think men are programmed to believe we don’t need help, that we can always get ourselves out of any situation. A very stupid way of thinking, but deeply ingrained. I told my wife I was going to call emergency services since my phone still had some battery. I was reluctant to doing it before because it felt humiliating but also because I thought somehow we were going to set a whole thing in motion that would probably cost us money. I could picture the morning news story: “Two stupid Mexican tourists had to be rescued from Morro da Urca last night”. I called, a recording said, “For English, press star.” I pressed star. Someone answered in Portuguese. I asked if they spoke English or Spanish, no, they didn’t. With my terrible Portuguese, I tried to explain. Out of frustration, I spoke very slowly in Spanish, hoping they would understand. I said we were lost on Morro da Urca and asked if they could alert a park ranger. “Wait a moment,” they said, and put me on hold for a few minutes. I don’t think they understood. Meanwhile, my wife kept shouting, and then we heard a shout from up the hill. She shouted again, another reply. “They found us!” my wife said. “Hang up!” I did. After shouting back and forth, we saw a flashlight from above. “Você pode me ver?” I asked in Portuguese (Can you see me?). “Sim, vejo!” they replied (Yes, I see you). More voices above. At least now we knew the park staff knew we were there. They shouted for us to go right. “Sua direita ou minha“ (Your right or mine?) I asked. They signaled with the flashlight, far away but visible. We started moving in that direction, constantly shouting so they could track our position. A few minutes later, we heard voices closer, at our level. We shouted, they shouted back. I had never felt so vulnerable yet so relieved to know help was coming. Finally, we saw the flashlight beam pointing at us. “Here!” we shouted waving our arms, like castaways spotting a rescue helicopter. When they reached us, My wife looked at me as if to say, “Holy crap, we made it!” I laugh now when I think about it. At last, we were found: three park workers with flashlights, one with a rope. They asked if we were okay, if we had any injuries. They led us back, about 10 minutes walking, to the spot we had started from. Pavement, civilization. Out of that green hell that, under the iPhone light, looked more black-and-white. They offered us water. I hadn’t noticed how sweaty and thirsty I was. We must have looked ridiculous, with our tourist clothes, a tote bag from a Danish museum and iPhones. Just a couple of dumb tourists who tried the trail and got lost. We had been lost about three hours, but it felt like six or seven. When I checked the time, I couldn’t believe it had been so short. Darkness, disorientation, and fear stretch time. They said they’d take us to a cable car to go down. My wife asked if there was any dangerous wildlife on the hill. “Only snakes” they replied. Normally there are two big enclosed cable cars on service, that ...[Content truncated]",Reddit

The person who understand the business and company the most in this world, is basically telling you to buy the fking stock as its value is not reflected. He then said this software is going to be the future, it was a luxury in the past but a necessity now and in the future as companies emerge as winners using Palantir. Palantir also helps with company transitions. Alex Karp then politely ask short-term investors to f-off and diss the wallstreet analysts who doubted palantir and how palantir time and time proven itself, diss the other tech companies who serve wallstreet and thus failed and also not serving long-term goals and average investors, basically mentioned confidently on how Palantir is going to strive in the future; which also means moon now in the short-term due to how undervalued the price is now. To end off, he mentioned AT LEAST 45% revenue growth for the next 5 years, 4 bil revenue or more by 2025 then.For those who dont know, in Q3, Alex Karp confidently mentioned AT LEAST 30% revenue growth, and he delivered 47% revenue growth in Q4. (cant post youtube videos, ""Palantir CEO Alex Karp on Software &amp; Society"" **Overlooked/Underestimated Earnings Report &amp; Fake News**: This brings me to my next point, i have no fking idea how all the media is publishing that PLTR has a -0.08 EPS , falling short of expectation of 0.02. The true EPS of PLTR is 0.06, a 200% beat instead. Anyway, stock employee compensation should not matter when evaluating a growth company, you are evaluating the company's performance and revenue performance. Stock Employee Compensation is high when the share price is high, and it will be reduced significantly as the employees' compensation contracts expire in the future. The future Earnings Report is going to look insane because since the media and everyone is factoring Employee Stock Compensation now, which is a huge cost, imagine the Earnings report with at least 45% revenue growth and reduction of Employee Stock Compensation. \*\***Start of Foundry &amp; Apollo business:**\*\*Just the beginning, with lots of potential to scale. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ytl73h8pnvi61.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1faa4a3498c8795c58cd9a4a885c976114ba294c \*\***Anticipated demand in regards to lock up expiration:**\*\* Everyone was selling off and waiting to buy in at the lock up expiration, IBM news got pltr up $10, to only sell off by $14 despite a good Earnings report.

413,Global,2025-02,"Should you get On or Off before it leaves the station $RVSN-Lets get 4 things out of the way first. 1. 55k shares @ 1.10 avg 2. This was not written by chatGPT 3. Idc if you think this is P&amp;D or scam (like most in this chat or pennies in general depending who you ask) 4. This could go to $0.00 RailVision $RVSN is at a point where it actually makes sense to start a position. I, like many others, jumped the gun and bought this as it was going up at the end of 2024 in hopes history would repeat itself with some sort of January run up. I've see comments or posts from those who have gotten burned by this stock saying ""rail is dead"", ""it's a dying industry"", ""they're reluctant to adopt technology or change their ways"". All of these are uneducated remarks. But from the outside, I guess you could see them as potentially accurate. However, I wanted to provide those uneducated folks with some information so they could decide if now is the right time to get on the train before it leaves the station. RailVision is mostly if not entirely out of the R&amp;D phase which is why their financials are/have been garbage (another popular comment on why this stock sucks). I'm not going to argue that their financials are great by any means. However, I will say that it *should* only get better exponentially from here. (Late march 2025 earnings will show 2H 2024) They have a ton of things going on. MOU with Sujan to enter the India Market Patents in Japan and US Initial order of 10 units with Israel Railways Lorem order Central American trial An order for trial at 1 of the 6 class 1 rails in the US Rio Tinto trial via Hitatchi Partners with KB one of the largest rail/train manufacturers suppliers in the world. There are other things in the works that we're not aware of yet and if you ask me, thats a ton of accomplishments in the short amount of time the company has been around. They are working to engineer, pilot, produce and implement a solution that is desperately needed in the Rail industry. Please also keep in mind that About 7-10**%** of the world's total freight is moved by rail. This varies significantly by region: * **North America:** Rail moves about 40% of freight, primarily bulk commodities like coal, grain, and chemicals. * **Europe:** Rail accounts for about 18% of freight transportation. * **Asia (China, India, Russia):** Rail plays a significant role, with Russia moving nearly 87% of its freight by rail, while China relies heavily on rail for inland bulk cargo. * **Passenger Transportation:** Rail represents **2-3%** globally but can exceed **20%** in countries with extensive rail networks like Japan, China, and parts of Europe. Below are some things to keep in mind: * Class I – Revenue greater than $250M per year * Class II – Revenue between $20M and $250M per year * Class III – Revenue less than $20M Here are the 6 class I rails in US * [BNSF Railway](https://www.railstate.com/category/bnsf/) – $23.9 Billion Revenue, 32,500 route miles, 35,000 employees. * [Union Pacific Railroad](https://www.railstate.com/category/union-pacific/) – $24.1 Billion Revenue, 32,100 route miles, 32,100 employees. * CSX Transportation – $14.7 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 25,000 employees. * Norfolk Southern Railway – $12.2 Billion Revenue, 21,200 route miles, 20,000 employees. * [Canadian National Railway](https://www.railstate.com/category/canadian-national/) – $12.5 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 24,000 employees. * [CPKC](https://www.railstate.com/category/cpkc/) – Estimated $9 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 19,000 employees after the merger of Canadian Pacific Railway and Kansas City Southern Railway. If you look at every SINGLE ONE of these rail companies and their use of AI/technology you would think twice about making the comment that ""Rail is dead, reluctant to change, don't embrace technology"". They have made DRASTIC improvements to their technology infrastructure and the amount of money they're spending in this component of their business is staggering. Comments from annual reports of Class I rail companies *""consistently increasing our annual investment in core infrastructure and spending $1.7 billion out of a total approximately $2.3 billion capital budget on track, bridge and signal projects and in our equipment and detection technology in 2024""* *""using autonomous track assessment cars (“ATACs”) to gather critical data on track conditions and send the data in near real time for assessment and, if necessary, expedited track repair.""* *""implementing and maintaining an extensive drone safety program that uses unmanned aerial vehicles to perform a wide range of tasks, including aerial mapping of yards, facility inspection, storm response, accident investigation and law enforcement;""* *""The Automated Inspection Portal is a sophisticated visualization system that provides real-time train inspection as trains travel at track speeds. Leveraging ultra high definition panoramic cameras, as well as infrared lighting, a full 360° view of the train and the undercarriage is captured. The Automated Inspection Portal utilizes machine vision applications, a subcategory of artificial intelligence with deep learning capabilities""* *""Our infrastructure and technology investments create safer operations across our network, reducing accidents and injuries, and protecting communities and the environment.""* *""Technology is essential to driving safety and advancing innovations into all aspects of our operations. In addition, capital investments support track and railway infrastructure maintenance to support safe and efficient operations. ""* *""BNSF's capital budget of$3.92 billion includes activities that support out efficiency and long term growth objectives in safety and reliability""* *""2024 capital budget is $3.94. $2.88 billion devoted to maintaining our locomotives, assets and technology infrastructure""* *""$441 million will be allocated for technology, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment acquisitions.""* NOW, if you've stuck with me this far you can see from a small snapshot of ONLY US based orgs (which are far behind in size, revenue and utilization compared to India, japan etc) that the numbers associated with these organizations are large. Their income is high, their expenditures are high and they are INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY. They are way ahead of where most people think in regards to using AI, Drones, LiDar and other means to increase efficiencies and their safety. Where RVSN comes into play: We need a SMALL market share of these gigantic numbers to move the SP higher. Now that we're through R&amp;D, actively securing trials and partnerships, I believe this will be a staple solution for many of the rail companies around the world. For those that thought this was going to be a quick pump to double digits, sorry. I dont think there is anything ""quick"" about the rail industry in general. However, I DO think RVSN is poised to become a big player in the AI obstacle detection space and as they continue to gain support from REAL World applications their SP and growth with reflect so. The sky is the limit for this company if they can secure POs for the various trials they're in, move things forward with Sujan, and continue to work on getting their product out there. To caveat ALL of this, this is still a penny stock, a company in it's infancy, and a huge risk from an investment perspective. But, if you're investing money you can stand to part ways with, than this might be an opportunity for you to get in with a company on the ground floor. The company needs to prove themselves, prove they can be smart with their money and prove that their product is in fact needed by the industry. If they can do those things, I believe this will be in double digits by 2026. Oh and i guess for some reason I'm supposed to include this disclaimer: This is NFA. Cheers",Reddit
414,Global,2021-03,"🚀 PLTR, Palantir WILL moon 🚀-I will just tell you why. also the friday news of Palantir with AWH is a $SNOW killer, bye snowflake and boomer buffett 1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX. A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, &amp; **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&amp;GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc. 2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on. 3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself. 4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon. 5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65. 6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under. 7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business. 8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now? 9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss. 10) Dont forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the 4Q earnings 11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment) 12) It's ok that the some retards dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them. PLTR, a baby of Cathie Wood &amp; Alex Karp. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀TLDR: PLTR 🚀 , buy PLTR.",Reddit
415,Global,2022-10,"Are Rio Tinto shares a good investment?-**Rio Tinto Plc** ([LSE:RIO](https://themoneycog.com/tickers/lserio-l)) shares are down about 2% year-to-date and flat over the past year, that’s roughly in line with the FTSE 100. And considering how tumultuous the stock market has been lately, these shares seem to be holding up quite well. Does that make them a good investment for my portfolio? Or should I be looking elsewhere for other attractive investment opportunities? **Originally Published on** [**The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/news/are-rio-tinto-shares-a-good-investment/) # What does Rio Tinto do? Rio Tinto was founded in 1873. Today it’s a leading global mining and mineral resources company headquartered in London. The firm engages in the mining and processing of aluminium, iron ore, copper, diamonds, gold, salt, lithium, borates, and titanium dioxide. Its diversified portfolio of mining sites is scattered around the world. It currently has over 50,000 employees operating across 36 countries and six continents. However, its flagship projects predominantly reside in Western Australia and North America. Rio Tinto shares first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in 1973. The share price has increased in the last decade by around 55%. And in the previous five years, it’s up by 38%. That’s ahead of the FTSE 100’s performance. The numbers may seem unimpressive. But it’s worth noting that Rio Tinto shares have consistently offered an average dividend yield of around 8% throughout its history. And following the latest surge in commodity prices, today’s yield stands at a whopping 11.3%! So, seeing this stock be a darling amongst income and institutional investors is hardly surprising. In fact, as of February 2022, over 70% of the shares outstanding are held by investment funds. In my eyes, that speaks volumes of the trust financial institutions have in the future performance of this business. # What does the key financial information say? Rio Tinto’s fiscal year end on 31 December. And in July earlier this year, the group released its interim results. Generally, 2022 has been an unprecedented year for most industries. And Rio Tinto shares are no exception. Financially and production-wise, the company’s performance in H1 2022 was below its performance in the same period of 2021 on the back of weakening commodity prices. Net cash generated from operating activities fell by 23% versus 2021 levels. However, it’s actually up by 80% when compared to 2020 levels. Similarly, free cash flow is also down by 30% year-on-year but up by 154% compared to the first half of 2020. Net earnings in the last six months came in at $8.9bn — that’s 28% lower than the 2021 first half. And its $15.6bn underlying EBITDA is also down by 26%. Given these double-digit declines across the board, it may seem strange that Rio Tinto shares haven’t dropped off a cliff. But this performance slowdown wasn’t unexpected since 2021 was an exceptional year for the commodity price of many resources. To the joy of Rio Tinto shareholders, the company continues to pay a sizable dividend. In fact, in the latest report, management declared an additional $4.3bn is being paid out. That’s the second-highest interim dividend announced in the entire history of the business and equates to a 50% payout ratio. As of 30 June 2022, the company had net cash of $291m compared to $1.58bn at the end of 2021. This massive reduction stems from the aforementioned dividend payout as well as an [$825m acquisition of the Rincon lithium project.](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-completes-acquisition-of-Rincon-lithium-project) # What risks do Rio Tinto shares have? No business is without risk. Before investing or buying the shares of any company, I try to understand the various threats it has to face. The leadership team categories the company’s risk profile into three sections: * **Operational** — Threats to mining and refining activities. Luckily there have been no fatalities in the last three years from accidents. * **Economic** — Fluctuations in macroeconomic factors and commodity prices. * **Strategic** — Acquiring the right talent and investing in new value-building projects. But there are additional threats on the horizon that Rio Tinto still need to address. The biggest one in my eyes is the push towards net zero emissions. It’s no secret that mining isn’t good for the environment. And that’s already placing the firm in the crosshairs of activists and new green government policies. Management has laid out plans to invest $7.5bn in green energy and carbon abatement projects between 2022 and 2030. But whether this will be sufficient, only time will tell. # Should I invest £1,000 in Rio Tinto right now? Mining stocks are a cyclical stock market sector. They go through multi-year periods of growth followed by underwhelming periods of decline in a loop defined by the fluctuations in the commodity markets. Where we are in the current cycle is anyone’s best guess. While many assume we’re near the peak of the growth cycle, continued demand for investments in renewable technologies could mean the cycle has plenty more to deliver. Looking at the valuation today, Rio Tinto stock is trading at only five times earnings. That, to me, looks cheap. And when paired with an impressive 11% dividend yield, I can’t help but feel a buying opportunity may have emerged. It’s possible that the decline of the commodity cycle may have started. And if that’s the case, I could be looking at a value trap here. But given the continued need for metals like copper, lithium, and iron ore, amongst others, I’m confident Rio Tinto shares can deliver plenty of long-term passive income. That’s why I’m considering adding £1,000 worth of stock to my portfolio today. **RELATED:** [**How to analyse drilling results**](https://themoneycog.com/news/drilling-results-2022-cheat-sheet/) # [Top 3 Stocks For Trying To Beat Rising Inflation](https://themoneycog.com/top-3-stocks-for-trying-to-beat-rising-inflation/) The stock market is reeling from the growing level of inflation.

Both companies have been charged with breaking Indonesia's environmental code, namely through the unsafe disposal of mining waste. Since the Mine's opening, mine tailings have simply been dumped Aikwa river, leading to the disappearance of native fish, and the deaths of many Papuans. In addition, there are fears that mine waste may be seeping into local groundwater. Charges have also been brought against the two companies for exploiting local workers, who are often tricked into becoming independent contractors instead of full-time employees, or simply falsely reported as such, in an effort to dodge wage and working condition requirements, and to expose the workers to dangerous working conditions filled with aforementioned toxic mine waste without consequences. There are also lingering suspicions that companies may have bribed local officials to overlook infractions, though evidence for these claims is somewhat skimpy. Nonetheless, these claims will be investigated, and any complicit officials will be brought to justice. Should the Indonesian government win, the two companies will have to pay 1.5 Billion Dollars, divided between the two based on their share in the mine, and be forced to conduct cleanup operations, treat their workers better, and build a new system for the disposal of waste.",Reddit

This was exhausting to compile and i spent many hours on it. I made sure to include sources throughout the DD as i encourage people to do their own DD. Things in bold are either directly from RVSN or what i deem important. I have deliberately left out India and Central America from this DD. Whilst the potential from them is huge especially India I decided to focus my attention onto the things that will generate cash quicker for RVSN then Central America and India. This does not mean I am bearish on them or believe that they are rabbit holes that lead to no where. I just wanted to condense this DD as it is already rather large. **---------- START OF REPORT ------------------------------------------------------------------------------** I want to start this report by highlighting the fact that I believe RVSN is making all the right moves for an explosive growth in sales. This includes forming relationships with key players in the industry specifically distributors and manufacturers as well as getting regulatory approval across different continents. **As noted by RVSN “We are investing in efforts to create and develop collaborations with leading train manufacturers. These collaborations are meant to be long-term, with the aim of integrating our railway detection systems into the future production lines of these train manufacturers. We believe that the railway detection systems we develop will be an integral part of future trains, and therefore it is important to invest marketing efforts as early as possible to promote partnerships with train manufacturers and increase market adoption of our railway detection systems.”** You can think of this as akin to how seatbelts were first introduced to cars. They came as an option and quickly turned into a requirement. RVSN seem to be going down this road inserting themselves into the manufacturing process. Instead of working hard to sell a few hundred systems a year to a train operator they could be shipped out on brand new trains which would substantially increase sales as well as sales to existing locomotives already in service. On March 18, 2023, the Company revealed its intention to **broaden its sales operations in the US by collaborating with a top distributor** to promote its unique products. Furthermore, Rail Vision aims to solidify its standing as a premier provider of safety products by directly engaging with and selling to industry leaders, Class I railroad companies, and top-tier players within the US railway sector.

They lease a 16900 square foot establishment for their company at a rate of 26k usd a month. **They are a dilution scam** * The majority of companies in the same stage of RVSN (early commercialization of product) dilute. How else would they acquire the money to actually start producing their product after RnD? It was either dilute which brings the price down and adds shares to the float or go bankrupt where you lose all your money. At least this has a chance of rebounding compared to losing 100% from bankruptcy. It was necessary to dilute and does not indicate RVSN is a scam company. * There was a third option which was to take a loan out. However with interest payments the dilution was the lesser of the two “evils” for the interest of the company **Reverse Split** * This is a possibility if we don’t breach the $1 mark by the 3^(rd) of September. I am confident by then we will have significant PR relating to Israel which I will list down below. RVSN hit 94c off no news at all recently (10^(th) February 2025). It is a fair assumption that if RVSN lands a contract with Israel we will fly past $1 at which the 180 days resets again if we fall back below $1. Also keep in mind that the $3.17 pump happened off just a 300k payment. $1 is not a lot if a decent contract is landed * RVSN just achieved regulatory approval with Israel in late December. This gives us 9 months to achieve a PR relating to a contract with Israel from the date of regulatory approval. * **“Achieving certification is a testament to Rail Vision’s dedication to excellence and our commitment to meeting industry compliance requirements,” said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision. “We have met the strict certification standard, which aims to enable Israel Railways’ future plans of high-volume procurement of Rail Vision products and services.”** **They have failed all their pilots** * This is simply not true. Rio was thought as failed but the recent 20-F filing stated * “The long-term pilot was concluded in August 2022. Following the completion of the long-term pilot, the company submitted a summary report of the pilot. As of today, we have not received any formal response from Rio Tinto relating to the next phase. **To the best of our knowledge, the next phase of the project is a tender due to be published by in the second quarter of 2025 in which we expect to participate in”** * I do not take Rio into consideration when making my decision to buy sell or hold but I do think the potential from it is enough to be included into this DD which I will include into the Australia part down below. **The CEO is a fraud** * The CEO took a pay cut the last 2 years to improve the financials of the company. This is not actions indicative of a fraud. A fraud would milk the company asap before investors caught on that it was a scam company and abandoned it **It will struggle to go up because of dilution** * The dilution occurred mainly before the pump to $3. This pump to $3.17 was predominantly based off a 300k payment from Israel. **It will experience significant selling pressure due to those getting out** * We have experienced capitulation. The worst of the selling pressure is behind us **They have no way of generating revenue after contracts** * Rvsn are moving towards a recurring revenue model based on their DASH platform.

RVSN announced they achieved the **approval to install their tech on Alstom trains in March 2024.** This collaboration is huge alone and should put to rest any concerns about RVSN tech being a “failure” **It also paves the way for Alstom to include RVSN technology in the manufacturing process which is what RVSN is working towards and referenced in their 20-F** RVSN has achieved regulatory approval in Israel. In the press release from December 2024 it states that now it has achieved regulatory approval Israel can now proceed with its **plans of a “high-volume procurement of RVSN products and services.** Furthermore, in the latest report from RVSN in the 20-F it gives an update on the Israel contract. **“The potential sales opportunity with Israel Railways for our Main Line System is for installations on up to 300 trains, and assuming we can negotiate bidirectional installation, the potential sale opportunity could be doubled to install up to 600 MainLine systems”** This number increased from 400 last year to 600 this year (the numbers released in the reports) This substantial increase might be related to Alstom recently signing a contract worth more then 700 million euros ...[Content truncated]",Reddit

TL;DR: Q1 is beating earnings by 14% or more. Stock price 29 at year end. Yes, this is my bullish case - a 30% increase over current price at time of writing - premarket 4/21 current price $22. Short term prediction q1 earning sends stock to 27 with a beat earnings of 20% q1, it sits back down after excitement. EOY (end of year) has Revenue per share of 35 still (my biggest bear sentiment) and overall revenue for PLTR is 1.5B+ for the year. Tons of space open for beating my estimates in total revenue and stock price EOY. Addendum - with sleep deprivation setting in and the view of the new Back Office Software - I think this could realistically hit 30+ on the quarter, but I doubt it will stay there until EOY without more Wall Street support. Game start: Listen, I’m a teacher. A music teacher. Not a math teacher. Not some super smart college professor. I’m a 29 year old, middle-high school band and chorus teacher that lurks in r/anime and plays as much video games as he can. I have skin in the game with PLTR and needed some DD that wasn’t “Yay new contract, time to buy the dip.” I present a bullish case with a lot of bear ideas (though maybe not enough!). Use this DD to form your own opinions and as already stated, I’m nobody you should take financial advice from, I’ve never even taken a financing course, though you may want to take a few of these ideas. Let's start with what we know. We have some companies with contracts disclosed, some we just know have contracts, and the earnings report from Q4. This leads into making guesses and postulating about the Q1 into a total yearly revenue which finally leads to my guesstimations. Episode 1: Q1 2020, the Dark Ages This is the dark ages of Palantir, my beautiful trading app TDAmeritrade and many others did not disclose what Q1 was for PLTR, only giving Q2-Q4. I initially added those up, saw that totaled PLTR’s total revenue, then took Q2 and divided it in 2. For a makeshift Idea on Q1, that left me with a 240.5M revenue from Q1. Well, I found out that [https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue](https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue) has the revenue listed at 229.33M. I’m already happy my guesses are bullish. Episode 2: Q4 2020, Tons of useful information. PLTR revenue of 322M. Individual customer’s average 7.9 million (Henceforth 7.9M) per year which is up 41% Year over year (YOY). The number of customers they had was 139. The top 20 customers made up 61% of their revenue, which is down from 67% YOY, meaning they MAY make more money from smaller contracts in this quarter and beyond. I did not give the smaller accounts the benefit this time due to bullish top 20 contract stocks. Episode 3: Known Contracts. Assuming all things equal, which they definitely aren’t, but I needed SOMETHING to base my numbers off of with these contracts, I presume the contracts PLTR procures are spread evenly across every quarter the contract is effective. Reminder, I teach music to children, for the more informed, I ask you to educate me and others on corporation contracts, it seems that usually there is a lump sum in the beginning, then a nice bonus at some point, say 50%-100% down the line? But for this, understand that I used an AVERAGE OF THE TOTAL OVER THE NUMBER OF QUARTERS THE CONTRACT APPLIES. This includes the most painful part, pure conjecture. The companies: NNSA - 5 year 89.9M. This equates to 20 quarters of pay for PLTR. 89.9/20 = 4.495M/quarter Army - 1 year 111M that may be on Q4 from December 12ish. 111/4 = 27.75M/quarter BP - 10 year 1.2BILLION. 1200M/40 = 30M/quarter Rio Tinto- 5 year (My estimate 700M) 700/20 = 35M/quarter. This was based on market cap alone. BP is 84B market cap, Rio is137B market cap and it was labeled “Significant.” This is my most bullish opinion here IMO, but Some contracts are probably straight up part of Q4, so take that as you will. PG&amp;E - No listed, (guessed 5 yr 100M.) 100/20 = 5M/quarter I’m guessing they are tired of paying multi-billion dollar fines for forest fires. Fujitsu - 1 year 8M. 8/4 = 2M/quarter NHS - 2 year 31.5M. 31.5/8 = 3.938M/quarter Again, listed In December, I’m bad enough to not know if this is priced in to Q4, remember, check your facts kids. (I’m 29… you may be older than me and definitely not a kid). Army ground Modernization - 1 year 8.5M. 8.5/4 = 2.125M/quarter SOMPO Holdings - 1 year 22.5M. 22.5/4 = 5.625M/Quarter (Listed December 28ish) Army vantage year 2 opt in on Dec 21… 1 year 113.8M. 113.8/4 = 28.45M/quarter Just in, A new contract for palantir and Back office software. This is 1.2B in euros split between 31 companies. May be uneven. If 1.2 euro/31 = 46567548.39 american dollars. (1.2B/31)x1.2 conversion from euro. Contract is seemingly set until 9 December 2024. 3.5 years or 14 quarters. 46.56M/14 quarters = 3.325M/quarter. This will not be included below, but helps me be more confident with what I state below. Additionally we have these companies that likely did not get reported on or I missed: Skywise, Ringier, World Food Programme, United, NIH, C4ADS, Faurecia, 3M (which is said to be a multimillion dollar contract). Episode 4: A Numbers Game with the Big Contracts. That’s a lot of info and speculation… Let's get you salivating with numbers and more speculation! I believe my numbers above to be very bullish, so my numbers below will tend to be bearish to try and balance everything out. Q4 reported 139 customers. As of 4/21/2020 that number may be around 249 based on [https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue](https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue). That is a huge increase, more on that later. 139 customers averaged 7.9million to give the total revenue of 1093M We know the top 20 was 61% of that so 1093Mx.61 is 666.73M, Just to make sure, let us double check with their average revenue from top 20 customers pulled from their Q4 earnings call. 33.2M avg x 20 customers = 664M I can’t seem to find the exact number so I’ll use 664M. 20 customers made up 664M annual revenue 119 customers then made up about 429M which is about 39%, this number may need to be lower based on other factors, but for this DD, I leave it. Episode 5: Looking Forward - Big Contracts for Q1 Lets add our quarterly estimates from the 10 companies earlier. 28.45+5.625+2.125+3.938+2+5+35+30+27.75+4.495 = 144.383M To be bearish, let’s assume either these are the top 10 of PLTR, or my numbers ran high and add “only” an extra 100M for the remaining top 10 companies. 144.383+100 =244.383M revenue /quarter. If this is our starting point, it’s a darn good one. Last years Q1 was 229.33M in revenue…. So, looks like we already beat that! So maybe That makes me too bullish (I don’t think it does, but for now, run with me!). Let's recall that the top 20 only make up 61% of the revenue. Excited yet? First let's double check some numbers on the big contracts. Taking a quick look at the guess, actuals for big contracts in 2020 = 665M/4 = 166.25M/quarter last year. Our current estimate has them at 244.383M/quarter. Infeasible? I think not, but definitely bullish. YOY growth for top 20 contracts according to Q4 = 34%. This puts them at a large, but not impossible 47% growth (244.383/166.25) and excitingly, this alone puts the market cap for the year to 244.383Mx4 = 977.5M (Reminder we had 1100M for 2020). If this is even possible, 20 customers are nearly paying for the total revenue PLTR had last year, and I think it’s possible. Average growth last year had average returns of 7.9M for each 139 customers invested. Breaking this down we get 1.975M a quarter average (7.9M/4). First, a quick double check of our top 10’s list to see if they are over the average! Yes, every single one posted beats the average. That’s a good start. Big contracts alone should average ((644M/20contracts)/4quarters) = (32.2M a contract/4quarters) = 8.05M/quarter from the big contracts. Checking our known contracts again, that leaves 5 in question as being one of the top 20, but there are a few that really balance that average out. The average of 244.383M/20contracts = 12.219 - still well above as mentioned previously with the 47% growth in the top 20 alone. A very Bullish thesis on the large companies, but we can balance that out in the small contracts. Episode 5 the small contracts Minus 110. If our top 20 contracts stand at 244.383 and we will keep the q4 contribution amount to 61%, so let's add in another 39% for the smaller contracts. For my sake, I fear that any new additions from [https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir) would be WAY too bullish, plus it is untested/unquantifiable data, so let's start with just the base 139 customers from Q4. 139-(20 bigs) leaves us with 119 smaller contract customers preparing to add 39% to the valuation. I wish to continue my bear(ish) thesis because otherwise this gets out of hand really fast. 2020 had a valuation of 1090M total. 61% of 1090 is 664.9M as mentioned earlier, leaving the small contract customers to take 425.1M (1090M-664.9M) which is 39% (I know I could have Math’d it 1090x.39). 425.1M/119 (again, that’s 139-20bigs) = 3.572M annual revenue from small contracts. 3.572M/4 = .893M/quarter per small company. Meaning on average from last year the smaller contracts added .893M 119 times into PLTR. so .893x119 =106.275M/quarter added from small contracts from last year. This assumes they are still playing PLTR and we see that number in this earnings report. This is your friendly reminder that I am absolutely a school teacher, not a financial advisor, because the next part is glorious. Episode 6: to Glory. We have the Large contract balance - 244.383M. We have the small contracts balance of 106.275M. We just have to do some basic math now! 244.383M+106.275M = **350.658M** Q1 2021. Who knew it’...[Content truncated]",Reddit

He says the federal government’s use of Palantir shows a need for higher standards around which companies it uses. “We need rigorous guidelines in place around government procurement that prevents public money being handed to companies actively engaged in genocide and suppressing democracy,” he told *Crikey*. “A question the Albanese government needs to answer is, did anyone check these fundamental threats to democracy before signing up with Palantir?” His comments echo concerns raised with Finance Minister Katy Gallagher and cabinet secretary Andrew Charlton last month by civil society group Digital Rights Watch. Digital Rights Watch chair Lizzie O’Shea wrote a letter last month to the cabinet members about the “uncertainty about where the data Palantir collects in Australia is being stored and who can access it”. The letter also highlights the national security risks of the government becoming “increasingly dependent on foreign companies to manage our most sensitive data”. The group’s head of policy Tom Sulston told *Crikey* that the dependence on Palantir was the direct result of a lack of investment in Australia’s own industry and regulatory framework. Now, he said, its growing presence presents a risk. “With our lax privacy laws, Australians’ information can be taken offshore and used for all sorts of unexpected and unsafe purposes without recourse. It’s more urgent than ever that the government finish the job it started reforming our privacy laws. It also must commit to transparency in its dealings with offshore tech companies, and refuse to deal with entities that have shown disrespect for human rights,” he said. The same goes for the corporate sector, where Retail and Fast Food Workers Union secretary Josh Cullinan said the union was blindsided by Palantir’s contract with Coles, which was signed early last year. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1212651 Cullinan said the decision to bring in Palantir reinforced that “Coles, like many other corporate behemoths, \[is\] a sociopathic entity unable to care about those to whom they have a duty of care.” While Cullinan said there is no issue with data analysis, the union’s concerns stemmed from previous failures to consider workers’ rights and the unique demands of their jobs when instituting “data-driven” reforms. “The data doesn’t identify that a customer with special needs requires more patience and time than others. Or that deliveries get delayed on occasion. Or that no worker should work alone in a department. Or that when workers are abused, threatened or assaulted, the workplace should close until it is safe,” he said in an email. “In fact, we too often see a senior management that lacks the capability or foresight to go beyond the demands of data. Too often, simple reliance is put on the Palantirs of the business world to deliver plans to reduce cost, no matter the human cost.” # What are your thoughts on Australia’s connection to Palantir?

In a strategic move that will begin replenishing the National Defense Stockpile and anchor domestic supply chains, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has awarded United States Antimony Corporation an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract of up to $245 million for bars of the strategic metalloid produced at the company's smelter in Montana. ""It's incredibly meaningful for all our employees to play such a strategic role in strengthening our nation's defense readiness and having the knowledge, expertise, and history that USAC can and will deliver under our contractual obligations,"" said U.S. Antimony Chairman and CEO Gary Evans. While antimony has long been considered a strategic metalloid to U.S. military readiness due to its uses in ammunition, fireproofing compounds, night vision optics, and other defense applications, its criticality rose significantly with China's ban on the exports of antimony – alongside gallium, germanium, and graphite – to the U.S. in 2024. Considering that more than 90% of the global antimony supply is concentrated in China, Tajikistan, and Russia, the ban by Beijing elevated the urgency to establish secure and reliable supplies of this metalloid critical to both military and consumer goods. As the only domestic antimony smelter, U.S. Antimony is positioned to quickly scale up a supply chain that can begin to meet America's 50-million-pound-per-year antimony demand. [Layout of U.S. Antimony's smelter in Montana.](https://preview.redd.it/93pum43k23rf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae0678cc59318921a123ebb2f49a253431afea4b) # Alaska-to-Montana supply chain Texas-based U.S. Antimony's stockpiling contract with the U.S. Department of War is the culmination of the company's efforts over the past two years to begin leveraging its small but vital smelter to establish a vertically integrated domestic antimony supply chain with links in Alaska and Montana. Unlike other companies that have emerged to help meet U.S. demands for antimony at a time when the world's largest supplier has halted exports, U.S. Antimony has been around for nearly six decades – though the New York Stock Exchange-listed company reemerged under new leadership beginning in 2023. This provenance and reinvigoration positioned USAC as the quickest solution to America's near-emergency need for antimony. With an operating smelter in place and ""some of the most experienced antimony chemists/metallurgists and other professionals on its team,"" U.S. Antimony only lacked a ready source of antimony ore to feed into its Montana facility. For this supply, the company turned to Alaska, a state that provided the U.S. military with antimony during both World Wars and has high-grade antimony lying on the ground – ready to be loaded into a truck and sent to Montana. While U.S. Antimony has acquired several Alaska properties with easily obtainable high-quality antimony, the company selected the Mohawk Antimony (previously known as Ester Dome) project on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city, as the first supply of feedstock for its Montana smelter. ""This project highlights Alaska's important role in America's resource future, while also underscoring USAC's mission to strengthen U.S. critical mineral independence away from foreign adversaries,"" Evans said during a Sept. 8 event that drew municipal, state, and federal policymakers to the Mohawk Antimony project. Because of the high-grade nature of the antimony found at Mohawk, U.S. Antimony does not need to establish a full-scale mine to secure feedstock for its smelter. As a result, the company quickly gained state approvals for a [site cleanup](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2025/08/22/news/us-antimonys-first-ak-project-cleanup/9232.html) and antimony production operation – and the first antimony was being stockpiled for shipment to Montana shortly after the dignitaries left on Sept. 8. # Flexible antimony contract With the signing of a stockpile contract with DLA, metal ingots refined from the Alaska ore will be stacked in a National Defense Stockpile facility. In addition to ensuring the U.S. military has a backup supply of this critical and strategic metalloid, the $245 million contract is supporting U.S. Antimony's efforts to establish a complete domestic antimony supply chain. ""To put this in proper context, we have successfully won a sole-sourced long-term contract from the U.S. Government for approximately $245 million, while our total reported revenues for 2024 were $14.9 million,"" said Evans.

Industry analysis obtained by The Australian claims there would be an $18bn hit on the economy if portable long service leave schemes were imposed across the economy. Based on existing worker entitlement funds, the analysis says this could deliver a “$900m revenue stream to ­unions”. Business chiefs are also concerned about the potential for employees to “double dip” via different long service leave laws. Amid private sector concerns about Labor’s IR agenda, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a warning as left-wing unions prepare to hijack a May Day rally in Sydney on Thursday to voice their anger at the Albanese government for putting the CFMEU’s construction division into administration. The FWO, which encouraged employees who planned to attend to use available leave, said it would monitor and investigate any “potential non-compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws”. The Victorian Labor government under Daniel Andrews was an early mover on portable entitlements schemes, providing a range of long service, sick and carers leave for workers across disability, aged care, cleaning, retail and hospitality sectors. Other Labor state and territory governments have set-up portable entitlements schemes, including Chris Minns’ NSW government which will launch a portable long service leave scheme for community services workers from July 1. Long service leave is typically accounted for by businesses as a contingent liability. Businesses still retain the actual money themselves as part of their working capital and that remains as a business asset. [Video-link](https://resourcesssl.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/stable/build/index.html?id=5348771529001-6372101881112&amp;domain=theaustralian&amp;iu=/5129/theaustralian.mobile.site&amp;amp=1&amp;ads=disable) Global Nuclear Security Partners Australia's Jasmin Diab discusses the positive effects that nuclear energy has had on an international level. “We are seeing nuclear power roll out all across the world, and economies thriving because of that,” Ms Diab told Sky News host Chris Kenny. “We don’t need to be the experiment to prove it again. “If we want to be serious about reducing carbon emissions … then let's listen to the science and engineering”. Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable, who represents companies including BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Lynas, said a universal portable long service entitlements scheme would be a “compulsory union tax on every business in Australia”. “This has nothing to do with protecting worker entitlements, and all to do with creating new income streams for unions to help fuel their political agenda. Worker entitlement funds are unregulated and unaccountable and are notorious for being exploited by unions who skim millions of dollars from these funds for their own profiteering,” Ms Constable told The Australian. “This will take billions of dollars out of the productive economy, from small businesses to large businesses, and lock it up in union-controlled funds – a massive hit to the economy that Australia cannot afford.” Pressed last year about the ­Department of Employment consulting on portable leave entitlements and the potential of new federal schemes, Mr Albanese confirmed “the Fair Work Commission are looking at these ­issues”. “We want to make sure our economy grows and that workers get a share of that growth. That’s been our objective,” Mr Albanese said in February last year. Anthony Albanese greets supporters at a pre-polling booth alongside Hasluck MP Member is Tania Lawrence (left) and Bullwinkel candidate Trish Cook (right) in the Perth suburb of Midlands. Picture: Getty Images Federal Labor, which has committed to helping disability workers access portable leave entitlements, has previously stated its support for protecting workers’ entitlements particularly in industries with itinerant patterns of employment. Asked if Mr Albanese would pursue a second-term IR agenda focused on universal portable long service entitlements or a broader national portable leave scheme, a government spokeswoman said Labor would protect workers from “Peter Dutton’s cuts to pay packets, penalty rates, working form home and the right to disconnect”. “The Albanese government’s focus is on continuing to lift wages, including by supporting an economically sustainable real wage increase for the lowest paid Australians, banning non-compete clauses in employment contracts and closing the gender pay gap,” the spokeswoman said. In November last year, the Australian Workers’ Union national conference endorsed a [universal portable long service leave scheme](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/awu-pushes-labor-government-for-universal-portable-long-service-leave/news-story/147de040aacdd26767a9309f6e99c893) to replace existing arrangements where employees accrue paid leave with a single employer. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says the inheritance tax is part of Labor’s “socialist agenda” and contributed to the near destruction of the Victorian economy. Mr Dutton sat down to take questions from viewers in an 'Ask Me Anything' special edition of Paul Murray. “The Labor party believe it, in inheritance tax every day of the week, Paul – it’s part of their socialist agenda,” Mr Dutton said. “They believe that you’ve got too much money and the person next door to you hasn’t got enough, and how do we find a way to tax you. “They nearly destroyed the economy in Victoria.” The AWU, which is pushing Mr Albanese and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt to make a portable leave scheme a second-term IR priority, argues that millions of workers are now in insecure work, with 22 per cent in casual roles. Treasurer Jim Chalmers, a member of the AWU, last week said IR priorities for a re-elected Albanese government would focus on gender and work done by the FWC, the modern awards review and changes to non-compete clauses. Unions are also lobbying for new rules allowing them to charge non-union members for bargaining done on their behalf and for all new migrant workers arriving in Australia to receive inductions to understand their rights and opportunities to join unions. Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said this isn’t “just about fairness, it’s about trust, integrity, and putting an end to union slush funds masquerading as worker benefits”. “For too long, these funds have operated in the shadows, with little oversight. It’s time for real accountability. Too many have looked the other way while unions treat these funds like private piggy banks,” Ms Wawn said. “Workers deserve control over their own money. They should have the right to choose who manages their entitlement contributions and full visibility into how those funds are invested and used.” Incolink chief executive Erik Locke, who runs Australia’s biggest union-backed worker entitlement scheme associated with the CFMEU and other trades’ unions, last year urged the Albanese government to set-up a national portable leave scheme across the workforce. Mr Locke said Labor should go beyond its 2022 election pledge to examine a portable leave scheme for insecure workers and look at a nationwide approach that would create a multibillion-dollar system of leave entitlements similar to superannuation. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said “long service leave entitlements should generally only accrue where employees actually perform a long period of service with their employer”. Mr Willox said portable leave schemes were causing major problems for employers given levies of around three per cent that typically apply. He said the cost of portable long service leave is often more than three times the cost of regular long service entitlements. “The last thing that employers and the community needs is for portable long service leave schemes to be expanded,” he said. A report released this week by the Liberal Party-aligned Menzies Research Centre said union membership had “declined from over 50 per cent of the population in 1976 to just 13 per cent i...[Content truncated]",Reddit

Please go ahead, sir. **Leigh Robert Curyer** Thank you, Joseph. Good morning, and thank you for joining NexGen's Q2 2025 Financial Results and Investor Conference Call. My name is Leigh Curyer, and I am Chief Executive Officer. Today, I'm joined by Travis McPherson, Chief Commercial Officer; and Benjamin Salter, Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, I'll discuss our exciting company advancements, including Rook 1 Project Readiness, Patterson Corridor East results, which strongly validate another significant mineral body is unfolding 3.5 kilometers to the east alongside Arrow. Further, the PCE results clearly suggest a very significant uranium mineralizing event has occurred in the Southwest region of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, on an unprecedented well scale and that we are really only at the beginning of defining its true extent. Further, the exciting developments in the uranium market over the quarter, including yesterday's announcement of NexGen doubling the volume in our offtake book, incorporating our key focus of market-related pricing mechanisms, ensuring NexGen Energy deliver industry- leading leverage to future prices whilst providing utilities with confidence with respect to volumes from Rook 1's technically, environmentally and socially operation. All in all, updating the critical role NexGen is set to play in delivering the world this vital clean energy fuel supply. At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050. In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers. Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet. According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy. The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now. In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements. In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits. None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium. All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE. While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly. Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply. Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving.

Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050. In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers. Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet. According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy. The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now. In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements. In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits. None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium. All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE. While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly. Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply. Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving.

449,Global,2021-03,"PALANTIR (PLTR) ""The Worlds Next Most important Software Company"". What you should know.-TLDR in bold. With the huge amounts of **innovation** going on companies are racing so they're not left behind. **That's where Palantir comes in**. **A Silicon Valley product company that saves other company lots of money and makes them more efficient**. Their software is a dashboard spotting patterns deep within company data. Finding the needle in several disparate haystacks. PLTR devises models so companies can predict the effects of changes they make *before* they make them. PLTR are believed to have assisted in Osama Bin Laden capture. **Assist in several military missions .** **It's harder to get an internship at Palantir than it is at Google** and this branding helps them attract the best talent. **Often known to use the ""drug dealer tactic""** where they're so confident in their product they give you a little for virtually nothing, and you come back for more. **Their Big Goal is to become default software platform across every imaginable industry** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # LEADERSHIP &amp;#x200B; [Alex Karp \(Left\) Peter Thiel \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/owl52a9p7fm61.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69852414448b05138eb1470fd21cf27c6696eab5) * **Bull**: Co-founder and Chairman **Peter Thiel** (also co-founder of Paypal and first outside investor of FB) is a Stanford Law Grad as is CEO **Alex Karp**. Thiel wrote a highly revered book ""*Zero to One*"" . He outlines how to have success as a start-up and from what I've read. He believes ""[Competition is for Losers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k&amp;t=1552s)"" Palantir is ticking off the boxes. Synopsis [here](https://youtu.be/Hd9pHZC7Sak) . &amp;#x200B; * **Bear:** They *themselve*s are not Computer Science / Software guys. Usually ideal for CEO do have in-depth knowledge of the field their product occupies. E.g Elon having education in Physics, Economics + Rocket Science Enthusiast. Microsoft CEO (electrical engineering *and* masters in Computer Science). &amp;#x200B; &gt;**Biggest Palantir threat is existing customers developing in-house solutions""-Alex Karp.** &amp;#x200B; * **Bull**: But the longer it takes customers to build their own solutions, the more ""smart"" Palantir's AI becomes. The delta between savings from Palantir and savings from developing in-house solutions grow wider and wider. **Keeping the customer in Palantir ecosystem.** &amp;#x200B; * There is a law that US government must first use 3rd-Party solutions and only if they don't work only then can they spend money and time on in-house solution development. &gt;**Army violated 1994 FASA law -- the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act** \-- *""by not conducting the market research needed to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs with or without modification"". -DefenseNews.com* &amp;#x200B; * **Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp the Stanford Law grads**. PLTR **sued the US-military** to high heaven and WON twice (again when military appealed). They've monopolised there and got CIA, FBI, Air Force, Marines and many many more departments. * **Harder to be accepted into Palantir than it is in Google.** The interview process is intense, few get in. It's become somewhat impressive to have worked at Palantir. Somewhat of a status symbol. * **Bear**: Their talent are paid on average less overall than some of the bigger tech companies. Larger workload per employee ( typical of a smaller company) . * **Bear :** They the multi-class structure of the common stock, concentrate voting power with certain stockholders, in particular, Founders and their affiliates. i.e they could sell all their shares and still have enormous voting power. # Palantir lack of profitability argument is poor and short-sited. Tesla, Amazon were both unprofitable for nearly 20 years. Yet they are arguably 2 of the most successful companies in the world with growing market share. People still doubt Tesla today even with all the proof of execution trying to push that it's overvalued. Edit: Disclaimer: I am long on Palantir and hoping to DCA building my position over the next few *year*s. # PROFITABILITY * Palantir offered huge stock based compensation (SBC) to their staff causing the apparent non-profitability. **SBC have been used by Google and Amazon in the early days to encourage staff to stay and grow with the company.** SBC is possibly a sign of conviction by execs that Palantir is going to grow in the future. * Initially they incur most of the costs when acquiring companies , Palantir are that confident that they take on the initial risk themselves. They are getting their money back increasingly [quicker](https://youtu.be/I_evytMozbI?t=233). * **Bear:** Some believe the **SBC numbers don't add up. SBC should not be high as it was** . Dilutes the shares. **SBC may suggest PLTR struggles for cash.** &amp;#x200B; If you want profitability i.e. more certainty, growth investing isn't for you and you'll make pitifully small returns. **Once consistent profitability is priced-in, the share price will reflect this. You may be paying 3x the price we paid to get the same number of shares.** Dollar cost averaging is your friend. Build your position as you see more proof of execution and you build your conviction. # GOVERNMENT WORK ""Too Political *Gotham--&gt; Government ,* * **BULL** **:** Palantir successfully monopolised a **previously undisrupted niche**. They **have survived during republican AND democrat cycles**. Even though the co-founders have very polar opposite political views: Karp (Liberal) and Thiel (Conservative) . A LOT of PLTR early costs were lobbying and getting government (gvt.) on board, developing the software. Garnering talented employees. Even in the beginning both CIA and FBI wouldnt budge. &gt;""We convinced the CIA that the FBI were already in and convinced FBI that CIA was already in. This was very clever as neither group wanted to be behind the other."" - Peter Thiel &amp;#x200B; * **Government bodies are notoriously adverse to change.** They spend huge money when economy is down (unlike commercial businesses). Palantir allows GVT to simulate the effects of a decision and act accordingly. Reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes financially and reputation-wise. &amp;#x200B; * ***Virtually*** **pandemic-proof and in future recession-proof** (some contracts are paid years in advance). They have proven to be a necessity in all economic and political seasons. Which a start-up would find VERY hard to do.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050. In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers. Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet. According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy. The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now. In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements. In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits. None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium. All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE. While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly. Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply. Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book.

451,Global,2025-07,"How Zionist Intelligence Networks Captured Western Power: From Rothschild Land Schemes to Epstein Blackmail and Unit 8200 Cyberwarfare-This is a primer about a powerful, organized, and deeply embedded network of Zionist operatives who used the state of Israel as a base and hides behind their own political opposition, and an evolving intelligence doctrine to infiltrate Western governments, media, and infrastructure. When anti-Zionist Jews become too inconvenient, they are destroyed by the ZIonist elite; systematically and from all angles... financially, reputationally, and even murdered. For those who don't know the history of how Zionism came to be and how even Hebrew was resurrected, geopolitics may seem like a confusing mess. Once you arm yourself with the right information, the geopolitical landscape becomes clear to see. While the Zionist Elite are not the only transnational group of criminals, they are, now, the most prominent. From Rothschilds to Meyer Lansky to the MEGA Group, the thread of Zionists through government, organized crime, and financial domination by any means necessary reveals a dark and twisted world at the top. I hope the following serves as a primer for the uninitiated; a jumping off point. Books can be written on each of these subjects individually, but no publisher will touch these subjects with any integrity. First, you should know about the Rothschilds. You should also know about the MEGA Group. --- ## **The Rothschild Dynasty** ### **Historical Influence &amp; Financial Networks** **Key Points**: - **War Financing**: Historically funded European wars (e.g., Napoleonic Wars, WWI/WWII), establishing bonds as debt instruments. While not unique, their role in war debt created long-term dependencies between states and their financial apparatus. - **Central Banking**: Indirect influence via advising institutions like the Bank of England and structuring bond markets. No direct ownership, but historical advisory roles enabled systemic leverage. - **Gold &amp; Commodities**: Controlled the London Gold Fixing until 2004, influencing global gold pricing. Current stakes in Rio Tinto and Glencore suggest ongoing commodity market influence. **Intelligence Concerns**: - **Opaque Financial Flows**: Historic use of offshore entities (e.g., Rothschild Continuation Holdings in Switzerland) raises questions about tax avoidance and capital movement. - **Resource Control**: Mining/energy investments (e.g., Shell, BP) align with strategic geopolitical resources, potentially enabling supply-chain manipulation. --- ### **Modern Corporate &amp; Policy Affiliations** **Key Entities**: - **Rothschild &amp; Co**: Global M&amp;A advisory, restructuring sovereign debt (e.g., Greece, Argentina). Current leadership under Alexandre de Rothschild. - **Edmond de Rothschild Group**: Manages $100B+ in assets, with private banking ties to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and governments. - **Corporate Board Roles**: - **De Beers** (diamonds): Influence over conflict mineral markets. - **Groupe Casino** (retail): Access to consumer data and emerging markets. - **Bilderberg Group/CFR**: Elite policy access, shaping globalization agendas. **Intelligence Concerns**: - **Revolving Door**: Former Rothschild employees in government roles (e.g., Emmanuel Macron) suggest bidirectional influence. - **Media Soft Power**: Historic ties to Reuters/Thomson Reuters; current philanthropic ventures (e.g., Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah) may legitimize geopolitical agendas. --- ### **Geopolitical Strategies &amp; Conflicts of Interest** **Case Studies**: - **Post-Soviet Privatization**: Advised Russian oligarchs and governments in the 1990s, profiting from undervalued asset sales. - **EU Austerity Policies**: Rothschild &amp; Co’s role in Greek debt restructuring prioritized creditor returns over public welfare. - **UK Utilities Privatization**: Advised Thatcher-era sell-offs, securing fees while shaping regulatory frameworks. **Red Flags**: - **Dual Advisory Roles**: Simultaneously advising governments and private entities (e.g., advising France on energy policy while holding Shell stakes). - **Tax Minimization Schemes**: 2015 Spanish indictment of David de Rothschild highlights risks of exploitative financial instruments. --- ### **Philanthropy as Soft Power** **Initiatives**: - **World Jewish Congress**: David de Rothschild’s presidency amplifies influence over diaspora politics and Israel relations. - **Environmental Ventures**: David’s “Plastiki” project and climate philanthropy align with ESG trends, potentially greenwashing resource-extractive investments. **Intelligence Concerns**: - **Legitimization of Agendas**: Philanthropy may mask resource-driven investments (e.g., green energy projects tied to Rothschild-backed mining). --- ### **Structured For Influence** The Rothschilds’ geopolitical influence stems from **structural access**, leveraging historic financial networks, corporate affiliations, and elite policy channels. Intelligence risks include: - **Resource monopolization** via commodity investments. - **Conflicts in sovereign advising** (profit vs. public interest). - **Soft power through philanthropy/media**. --- ## I. The Blueprint: Land Theft Disguised as Philanthropy Long before Israel became a state, the Rothschilds and their affiliates established the model: use philanthropy and diplomacy to mask geopolitical conquest. * **Edmond de Rothschild** funded PICA (Palestine Jewish Colonization Association), buying Ottoman land via proxies and establishing front settlements. * **Laurence Oliphant**, a British “diplomat,” conducted covert mapping of Arab resistance zones and water sources, creating a military-intel roadmap for later Zionist militias. * **Alliance Israélite Universelle** operated early human terrain intel networks in Jerusalem under the guise of education. Their strategy: register land via straw buyers, exploit tax loopholes, and rewrite the narrative by portraying Palestine as “a land without a people.” --- ## II. From HUMINT to Paramilitaries: The Vienna Nexus and Beyond In 1913 Vienna, Zionist operatives ran proto-intelligence networks targeting ideological influencers: * **Freud**, **Trotsky**, **Hitler**, and others were surveilled or manipulated. * Zionists like **Jabotinsky** and **Arthur Hantke** used salons and cafés to recruit, profile, and sometimes provoke key figures to create pretexts for future action. * Zionists experimented with **false flag tactics**, disinformation, and ideological baiting—skills refined over decades and later applied by Mossad, BlackCube, and Unit 8200. --- ## III. The Haavara Agreement: Zionist-Nazi Collaboration In 1933, the Zionist Federation signed a secret pact with Nazi Germany to transfer Jewish wealth to Palestine. The **Haavara Agreement**: * Allowed the Nazi regime to siphon Jewish assets. * Used confiscated Jewish capital to fund Zionist settlements. * Undermined international boycotts of Germany. * Resulted in the deaths or economic destruction of tens of thousands of Jews. Zionist elites like **Chaim Arlosoroff** and **Arthur Ruppin** prioritized state-building over saving lives and they were happy to dump off the Jews that were politically inconvenient to the Zionist agenda. --- ## IV. 1948: Ethnic Cleansing via False Flags To establish Israel’s sovereignty, Zionist militias like **Irgun** and **Lehi** executed a series of false flag operations and terror campaigns: * **Semiramis Hotel Bombing**: Haganah attack blamed on Arabs. * **Deir Yassin Massacre**: Used psychological warfare to induce mass Arab flight. * **Ben Yehuda Street Bombing**: Disguised Jewish militants blamed Arabs to radicalize Jewish moderates. These tactics laid the groundwork for Israel’s founding myth while hiding systematic ethnic cleansing. --- ## V. Lavon Affair: Israel Bombed Allies, Blamed Muslims In 1954, Israeli military intel (Aman) launched **Operation Susannah**, bombing U.S. and British targets in Egypt to drive a wedge between Cairo and the West. * Agents used Egyptian Jews as operatives. * When exposed, Israel disavowed responsibility, scapegoated Defense Minister **Pinhas Lavon**, and destroyed incriminating evidence. * CIA memos confirm Israeli culpability. This became a template for future false flag terror. --- ## VI. USS Liberty: Deliberate Attack on the U.S. In 1967, Israeli jets and torpedo boats attacked the USS Liberty: * 34 Americans killed; 174 wounded. * Intercepted Israeli comms confirm they **knew** it was an American ship. * NSA jamming evidence and survivor testimonies point to an attempt to frame Egypt. * President Johnson covered it up to protect the Israeli alliance. --- ## VII. Jonathan Pollard: Espionage with Impunity Pollard, a U.S. Naval intel analyst, handed **over 1 million classified documents** to Israel, including: * Nuclear targeting data. * SIGINT intercepts. * Names of U.S. agents in Arab nations. Despite this massive betrayal, Israel shielded his handlers and celebrated him as a hero. The U.S. response? A slap on the wrist and later concessions. --- ## VIII. The Epstein Nexus: Mossad’s Global Kompromat Machine Jeffrey Epstein was not just a predator. He was a **kompromat asset** linked directly to Israeli intelligence: * Funded by **Leslie Wexner**, who gifted him a \$77M townhouse used for surveillance. * Ghislaine Maxwell’s father, **Robert Maxwell**, was a Mossad asset. * Epstein's homes were wired for audio/video—used to blackmail politicians, scientists, and royalty. Flight logs show **Ehud Barak**, **Bill Clinton**, and others made repeated visits. The “client list” remains classified—not for justice, but for leverage. --- ## IX. The Mega Group: Zionist Billionaires and Policy Capture A shadowy cabal including **Wexner**, **Bronfman**, **Black**, and **Lauder**: * Funds NGOs that smear critics as “antisemites.” * Controls media narratives via outlets and philanthropic pressure. * Uses Epstein-style kompromat to direct policy—e.g....[Content truncated]",Reddit

FTDs: Negligible as of 02/14/24. **Recent Activity:** $RVSN secured patents in India, the U.S., countries throughout the EU, and Japan over the past two months. This is no small feat and should be regarded as a technically strategic series of accomplishments, as locking-up patents in multiple countries within a 60-day period is coordination, not coincidence. Rather, they intend to take the deep learning and AI railway market niche by storm. Despite their humble market cap, $RVSN secured proof of concept contracts with Rio Tinto Mining in Australia and a major Latin America (LATAM) mining company railway system more than three years ago. $RVSN has equipped partnership with both Hitachi and NVIDIA. Last week, when its partnership with NVIDIA was announced, the stock price rose from more than 100% and back down again, literally in less than 120 seconds. **The Plan:** The company is currently operating in what's known as ""stealth mode"". $RVSN secured patents in India, the U.S., countries of the EU, and Japan over the past two months. This is no small feat and should be regarded as a technically coordinated series of accomplishments, as locking-up patents in multiple countries at once within a 60-day period is no coincidence. Rather, they intend to take this market niche by storm. Did you know they secured proof of concept contracts with Rio Tinto in Australia and a major Latin America (LATAM) mining company railway system more than three years ago? $RVSN, equipped w/partnerships w/Hitachi and NVIDIA, is operating in what's known as ""stealth mode"". **Current Status:** While in stealth mode, companies operate in secrecy or with minimal public visibility as much as they can for various strategic reasons. During this period, the company may work on developing its technology, securing patents, finalizing proof of concept projects, and raising capital without drawing attention from competitors, the media, or the public. The primary objectives of operating in stealth mode include: 1. Protecting Intellectual Property 2. Focusing on Product Development 3. Strategic Market Entry Stealth mode is particularly common in technology and biotech sectors, where the development cycle for new products or technologies can be lengthy and the competitive advantage lies significantly in innovation and being first to market. Once the company ""steps into the light,"" it typically has a developed product or technology ready to launch, secured patents protecting its innovations, and possibly several rounds of funding to support its growth and expansion. Signs $RVSN is operating in stealth mode? 1. The sheer rate of its patents. 2. Its use of Rule 144 in using SAFE conversion. 3. Its election to operate as an emerging growth company on its latest SEC filings. 4. Its leveraging of Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 to offer securities on a continuous basis. **The Logic:** Think about how many train accidents could be prevented with an AI-based deep-learning apparatus that can collect and analyze data continuously on 1-2 mile of track in front of passenger and commercial trains? And they haven't even gotten into using facial recognition software yet as a loss prevention measure in cases of robbery and theft.

453,Global,2025-06,"Worley CEO Chris Ashton is doubling his workforce at the engineering company using AI-# The CEO of this $7b company is doubling his workforce – by using AI *Worley chief executive Chris Ashton says artificial intelligence will enable one engineer to do the job of two people, or three, or four.* Chris Ashton, the chief executive of the $7 billion, ASX-listed global engineering group Worley, recently took an example of an artificial intelligence calculation to the board to explain how his 45,000 staff could do the work of 90,000 employees. “We showed this to our board, an engineer doing a calculation to understand what thickness a wall should be if it’s carrying a product of a particular pressure,” Ashton tells BOSS from the business centre at Melbourne’s Grand Hyatt during a visit from his US home in Houston. “Let’s say an engineer can do one calculation every three hours. With this technology, rather than having four people do four calculations over three hours, you can have one person do the same,” he says, adding that most of his staff have two or three degrees. “Artificial intelligence will allow you to \[have\] one engineer act like they are two, or three or four,” he says in a thick, northern English accent. One AI application already up and running at Worley is used to assist the company’s procurement teams working on technical evaluations of vendor bid documents, reducing the time spent on data extraction from weeks to hours. Ashton has a vested interest in leveraging the size and skill of his workforce. Faced with a shortage of engineers, the executive says [AI will enable Worley to make the most of what it has](https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/genai-helps-engineers-cut-response-time-from-weeks-to-minutes-20250217-p5lcr7). It is not about [replacing white-collar workers](https://www.afr.com/technology/amazon-chief-warns-white-collar-staff-their-jobs-are-on-the-line-20250618-p5m8am). The company doubled in size in 2019, from about 30,000 people to close to 60,000, after its $4.5 billion acquisition of the Jacobs Engineering Group’s Energy, Chemicals and Resources (ERC) division. Since then, it has contracted back to about 45,000 and finding enough engineers each year remains a major challenge. “Last year, we hired 700 graduates, but that’s only 1.5 per cent of our workforce. We’ve got more than 1.5 per cent of people retiring each year,” Ashton says. A rendered image of the $US44 billion Alaska LNG pipeline, being developed by Glenfarne, for which Worley has been selected to deliver engineering services. Supplied The CEO is also trying to rectify the gender imbalance. This year’s graduate intake in Australia was 52 per cent women, and women in project manager roles have grown to 22 per cent, up from just 9.5 per cent three years ago. # Gas critical, nuclear not The global engineering giant is a little-known Australian success story. It was founded by local structural engineer John Grill, who bought the company as a shell more than 50 years ago and ran the business until 2012 – and to this day he remains the chairman. Former Dow Chemical Company CEO Andrew Liveris and former Treasury boss Martin Parkinson are on the board. Ashton says Grill, for all his considerable achievements, was no marketer, which is why most Australians do not know the company, despite it sitting behind many of the country’s largest resources companies such as BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside Energy and Santos. Worley founder chairman John Grill. Supplied “The mines have to be designed, equipment and facilities designed and built,” he says. “We’ll do the construction and management of facilities, we do that for iron ore, copper, lithium, gas, nuclear, oil and gas refineries, LNG and chemical plants.” Its reach is truly global, with most of its employees and revenue coming from outside Australia, despite its origins and local listing. “We have more employees outside Australia than any other Australian company,” Ashton boasts. Worley’s 12,000 projects are some of the largest energy projects in the world. It has just been selected by energy developer Glenfarne to deliver engineering services for the $US44 billion Alaska LNG pipeline in the US. It is acting on the Northern Endurance Partnership and the Net Zero Teesside Power projects, two of the UK’s most important carbon capture and low-carbon power projects. Worley is also working with battery materials and technology company Talga to deliver engineering, procurement and construction for the Vittangi graphite anode project in Sweden, which is critical to Europe’s green transition. Ashton says the company does not do as much work in wind and solar because it is such a highly competitive sector. The focus is on more complex energy facilities. But the CEO, who drives an electric Ford Lightning pickup truck himself, says that Australia has natural strengths in wind and solar, which, if properly complemented with gas, could deliver a net zero economy. “The reality is globally what we see around the world is that gas is an essential element of the energy transition,” he says. Despite Worley’s long experience in nuclear energy, Ashton doesn’t believe it is needed in Australia. “We’ve got a long history working in nuclear but nuclear has always been contentious,” he says. “Australia has other natural resources like gas and plenty of space for wind and solar. I think Australia can move to a low-carbon economy without nuclear.” # 3 countries, 3 continents, 17 homes Ashton’s path to the top of the corporate tree has been anything but linear. “I left school at 16 and was in the north-east of England,” says the 58-year-old. “There were four major industries, ship building, coal mines, steel mills and chemical plants and there was an expectation, if you left school you did an apprentice in one of those industries,” he says. “I made a decision, I wasn’t going to go down a coal mine. The steel mill and chemical plants were too far away, but the shipyard was a mile and a half from where I grew up, so I could walk to work. I left school on the Friday and started as an electrical apprentice there on the Monday.” Ashton started night school and his boss agreed to drive him, which he did for three nights a week over two years. By the time Ashton graduated in 1989, the shipyards were closing down. “Margaret Thatcher was in full swing,” he recalls. He went to work at chemicals company ICI. From there, Ashton went to Shell where he worked offshore for two years, before going back to school to do an MBA. Ashton joined Parsons ERC in 1998 and moved to Houston with the business in 2000. He met his wife while in the US and the couple had a daughter, now 13. Chris Ashton’s path to the top of the corporate tree has been anything but linear. Fairfax Media When Worley bought Parsons ERC in 2004, Ashton was brought on board, which led to a decade of moving across the world. “Three states \[Texas, California, Philadelphia\], three countries \[US, UK and United Arab Emirates\] and three continents. I’ve lived in 17 homes, just since I’ve joined Worley. “What I’ve said to people \[is\] that if you want to develop your career, you’ll do it more quickly if you’re willing to move to an opportunity rather than waiting for an opportunity to move to you,” he says. “In my 27 years, I’ve only turned down one opportunity and that was to move to Angola in 2005. Do not think of your career as being linear. Be willing to move around to develop a multi-skills package.” In 2005, he moved to LA to run the western region of the US. In 2009, the family moved to Philadelphia, where he ran the US power business, and in 2011, he was promoted to run the global power business. In 2013, he was moved to Abu Dhabi, but after nine months he moved back to London to run Europe, Middle East and Africa. After the Jacobs acquisition in 2019, Ashton was appointed chief operating officer and tasked with bringing the two businesses together. His key job was developing a strategy, which he was asked to implement as the new CEO from 2020. One of Ashton’s first tasks was designing a new purpose statement and set of values for the business. The group held 80 workshops with the staff across the globe. The purpose statement became delivering a more sustainable world. Ashton said in February that the US President Donald Trump’s administration was [“net positive” for the business](https://www.afr.com/companies/infrastructure/worley-expects-profit-boost-from-trump-energy-policies-20250225-p5lew7) because it was sparking a resurgence in new fossil fuel projects. Investors are cautiously optimistic with JPMorgan, UBS and Macquarie Equity Research all encouraged that Worley maintained its earnings guidance during an investor day in May, despite the global uncertainty. “Expectations going into the investor day were low, with concerns around recent volatile US policies driving customers to pull back on capital spending,” JPMorgan said in a note. “However, Worley reiterated 2025 guidance and highlighted the agility, flexibility and diversification of the business that enable it to maintain resilience throughout market cycles. “Management emphasised its competitive advantages and strategic initiatives \[including AI\] that continue to pave the way for margin expansion and growth, consistent with previous commentary,” it said. “The key concern from here remains the ability for customers globally to have enough confidence to make capital allocation decisions in the current environment.”",Reddit

The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on. 3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself. 4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon. 5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65. 6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under. 7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business. 8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now? 9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss. 10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings 11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment) 12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do.

458,Global,2025-03,"A Look at Mader Group - Uncovered Gem?-**Company Overview** Mader Group Limited (ASX: MAD) is an Australian-based provider of specialist technical services for heavy equipment maintenance in the mining, energy and industrial sectors. Founded in 2005, Mader has grown into a global business servicing over 430 customers across 570+ locations worldwide. The company’s core offering is “tap on, tap off” maintenance support – deploying skilled mechanics and technicians to keep heavy mobile machinery and fixed infrastructure running optimally through in-field repairs, overhauls, preventive maintenance, and training services.​ Mader operates an asset-light model, which allows it to mobilise teams quickly across different regions. Mader has a workforce of over 3,200 and regional offices supporting operations across Australia, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. **Customer &amp; Geographic Profile​** Mader’s main customers are mining and resource companies and related contractors. Its client base includes some of the world’s largest miners, including BHP Group, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals and CITIC Pacific Mining. These clients operate large fleets of trucks, excavators, drills and other heavy equipment that require regular maintenance. In FY24, approximately 24% of the Mader’s revenue was from five key customers, and the top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of the company’s revenue.”​ Whilst no single customer contributed over 10% of revenue in FY24, the business does remain somewhat reliant on a concentrated base of large resource clients. Mader has expanded to serve a diverse range of industries and geographies. Within resources, the company’s technicians work across multiple commodities – from iron ore and coal to gold, copper and lithium. In the energy sector, Mader’s dedicated Mader Energy division supports oil and gas operations (such as servicing natural gas compression equipment in U.S. shale fields​). Mader’s largest operations are in Australia (where it services all major mining states) and North America. In the United States, Mader now operates in 37 states. It established a foothold in Canada in 2021 and expanded to 8 provinces. The company also maintains a “Rest of World” segment covering work in Asia and recently re-entered Africa by securing a 12-month maintenance contract in Zambia. For FY24, the revenue split by region was as follows​: \- Australia: $585.7 million (approximately 75.6% of total revenue) \- North America: $177.8 million (approximately 23%) \- Rest of the World: $11.0 million (approximately 1.4%) **Financial Performance &amp; Growth Catalysts** Mader Group has delivered strong growth over the past 3 years. Annual revenue nearly doubled from $402 million in FY2022 to $774.5 million in FY2024, a 27% year-on-year increase in the latest year. This growth has been entirely organic, reflecting a greater volume of work across all regions. Heavy customer demand for Mader’s core mechanical services in Australia drove a 25% revenue increase in FY2024. North American revenue also grew 34% in FY2024 despite some softening in commodity markets. Here’s a snapshot of the FY24 financials: \- Total Revenue: $774.5m, +27% \- EBITDA: $99.2m, +32% \- EBITDA Margin: 12.8%, +0.5 ppt \- NPAT: $50.4m, +31% \- NPAT Margin: 6.5%, +0.2 ppt \- Net Debt: $31.2m, –27% **Future outlook and catalysts:** Mader remains optimistic about continued growth. The company has provided FY2025 guidance for at least $870m revenue and $57m NPAT, representing roughly 12% growth on FY24. Management has articulated a five-year strategic plan (FY22–FY26) emphasising diversification by service line, geography and industry. By the final year, FY2026, Mader aims to surpass $1 billion in revenue. One major growth catalyst is the ongoing demand in core mining markets: miners prioritise productivity and output, which supports outsourcing maintenance to partners like Mader. Another catalyst is North American expansion – after a period of consolidation in 2024, Mader’s North American segment has returned to headcount growth and is set to benefit from improving commodity prices and a large addressable market. The company re-established an operating presence in Africa. **Competitors** Mader Group operates in a competitive mining services landscape, facing a range of rivals from small local contractors to large multinational firms. Key competitors can be grouped into a few categories: Equipment OEM service teams: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like Caterpillar (via dealers such as WesTrac in Australia) and Komatsu provide machine maintenance services. Labour hire and maintenance contractors: Several other contractors specialise in providing tradespeople and maintenance services to mines. This includes large mining contractors like Perenti Global (ASX: PRN) and Monadelphous Group (ASX: MND). **Share Price** Mader Group’s share price has delivered outstanding returns since listing, although with some volatility. The company IPO’d in September 2019 at $1.00 per share and trades above $6.00, reaching $7.50 in 2023. It hasn’t been all smooth sailing; shortly after listing, the stock dipped below the IPO price during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. As commodity markets recovered, Mader’s shares climbed steadily through 2021 and 2022, then accelerated. **Conclusion** Strengths Financials - Strong track record of revenue and profit growth and solid cash generation. Scaleable, asset-light business model with high returns on capital (ROE: &gt;28%) Customer Base- A top-tier customer base, including BHP, Fortescue, and Rio Tinto, instils credibility. Tight Ownership - Over 70% of the company is held by insiders Operational Flexibility - Can respond quickly to changing demand in a historically cyclical sector. Strong Reputation - A reputation for providing a high-quality service, emphasising employee culture and safety. Risks &amp; Weakness Exposure to Mining Cycle - If commodity prices plunge or miners cut spending, maintenance service providers can see reduced workloads. Low Barrier to Entry - Highly competitive and can face pricing pressure from small and large competitors. Insourcing - Mining companies might hire maintenance staff internally instead of outsourcing, which could affect Mader’s business. Weak MOAT - The nature of mining services is that contracts can often be short-term or at the client's discretion. Low switching cost for a client to change maintenance contractors Mader Group presents a mix of high growth and solid operations, with clear pros (market leader in a necessary service, global growth runway, strong finances) and cons (commodity exposure, competitive pressures, limited inherent moat). The company’s ability to navigate the mining cycle and continue its global expansion will determine whether it can sustain its impressive track record. If it does, Mader could increasingly be considered a standout mid-cap industrial. Any slip in execution could quickly erode its advantages. For now, Mader’s strategy of focusing on what it does best – keeping the world’s mines running – appears sound, and industry perception is that while its economic moat may be narrow, its operational excellence effectively serves as its moat in practice.",Reddit

Trump on Tuesday revoked predecessor Joe Biden's 2021 executive order that sought to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 are electric. Automakers had been positioning for a jump in EV demand due largely to that Biden move. Trump's order [caused shares](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/asian-car-battery-makers-hit-trump-gets-work-2025-01-21/) of Japanese automakers, South Korean battery makers and Australian, U.S. and Chinese lithium miners to slip. But even if EV demand cools in the world's second-biggest auto market, analysts and industry experts expect traction elsewhere to more than compensate. Trump has [planned other regulatory changes](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/) to cut off support for EVs and charging stations. He also aims to strengthen measures b[locking imports](https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-that-might-be-affected-by-trumps-promised-tariffs-2024-11-26/) of automobiles and battery materials from China. ""Every time people take away subsidies or benefits ... it's a dent to the demand scenario,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock at Barrenjoey, an Australian investment bank. ""(But) ultimately demand will still grow even if the U.S. is a bit slower under Trump."" Australian lithium producer Liontown Resources [(LTR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LTR.AX) said the global transition to EVs was underway, with or without the United States."" Longer term, I just don't think it will be an issue on demand,"" Antonino Ottaviano, Liontown's CEO, said on a Tuesday analyst call. Much of the EV industry's growth happens in China, accounting for 11 million sales or 65% of the market, compared with North America, which accounts for 20% of the market, Liontown executives said on the call. Meanwhile, the rest of the world already accounts for 1.3 million EV sales and is growing at 27% year on year, a trajectory that will see it become more meaningful than the entire North American market in less than two years, the Liontown executives added. That growth potential is something Chinese EV manufacturers are chasing given they are locked out of the U.S. market due to [100% EV tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-locks-steep-china-tariff-hikes-many-start-sept-27-2024-09-13/) imposed by Biden.

(TSXV: MAI) **(the ""Company"" or ""Minera Alamos"")** and Sabre Gold Mines Corp. **(""Sabre"")** (TSX: SGLD; OTCQB: SGLDF) are pleased to announce the closing of the previously announced acquisition by Minera Alamos of Sabre and its flagship Copperstone gold project (*see news release dated October 28****th****, 2024*) (the ""**Transaction**""). * **Creation of a Diversified North American Gold Producer Platform** \- Beyond the Santana gold mine operations (Sonora, Mexico), the addition of Copperstone (Arizona, US) helps provide visibility to a further 150koz of annual gold production in premier mining jurisdictions in North America * **Acquisition of Past Producing Copperstone Mine** \- Sabre's flagship asset produced a total of 514,000 oz of gold from 1987 to 1993. Along with existing infrastructure, the project contains significant additional resource ounces and is at advanced stage permitting for a near-term mine restart * **Accelerating Copperstone Back into Production** \- Minera Alamos' in-house mine-building expertise combined with Minera Alamos's previously acquired process plant equipment will allow for significant reductions in restart time of the Copperstone mine in this very strong gold price environment ""We are excited to have closed the Sabre Transaction that provides a new development platform for our shareholders in a stable jurisdiction. The Copperstone mine provides excellent leverage to gold prices and is in keeping with our other assets in that it has robust economics at much lower and more conservative gold price scenarios."" stated Doug Ramshaw, President of Minera Alamos. ""Even in advance of the acquisition closing we have had discussions with various project financing groups with regard to advancing Copperstone. With a shift toward more positive sentiment on the outlook for the Mexican mining industry in 2025, this year is expected to be a very active one for the Company and we are preparing for overlapping project development work in both Mexico and Arizona."" **Team** Minera Alamos is pleased to have added Louell Uy to our mining planning group. Louell has been an independent consultant for the last 6 years, following his work with both Teck and Rio Tinto between 2008 and 2017 in various capacities that largely centred around mine planning engineering which will be leaned on heavily both at Santana and Cerro de Oro in Mexico as well as at the newly acquired Copperstone mine. In addition, Minera Alamos has begun the process of adding team members that will be exclusively focused on the Copperstone project. Garth Wilcox will be providing additional engineering, design and construction support services as the project lead for Consultec Group. Garth previously worked with the Minera Alamos team during the successful build out of the El Castillo gold mine under the Castle Gold banner in 2008-2011. **Mill Components Relocation** Minera Alamos is currently reviewing transportation proposals for the movement of the processing plant (mill) equipment that is currently in storage in Val d'Or, Quebec down to the Copperstone site. A full schedule for the move is expected to be finalized later this quarter. **Preliminary Economic Assessment (""PEA"") Update** As part of the requirements of the Securities Authorities, the previous PEA Report commissioned for Sabre titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report: Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Copperstone Project, La Paz County, Arizona, USA"" by Hard Rock Consulting LLC and with an effective date of June 26, 2023, will be re-issued in Minera Alamos's name. This is expected to be filed in February 2025 and will take into account the reduced royalty load as a result of Sabre extinguishing a 1.5% NSR on the property (*see Sabre news release dated November 11\*\*th* *2024*) and also highlight gold price sensitivity beyond the original report as a result of the movement in gold prices since it was first published. **Stock Option Grant** Minera Alamos has also granted 6,200,000 incentive options to new and existing employees, management, directors and consultants of the Company with an exercise price of $0.33 and a term of 5 years. In addition, 800,000 options with an exercise price of $0.60 and a term of 5 years were granted to Doug Ramshaw, President of the Company. All options vest immediately. **Transaction Details** Pursuant to the Transaction, each issued and outstanding common share of Sabre (the ""**Sabre Shares**""), including each Sabre Share issued in connection with the Debt Settlement (defined below), was acquired and exchanged for 0.693 of a Minera Alamos common share (the ""**Minera Alamos Shares**""), resulting in the issuance of 76,499,114 Minera Alamos Shares. Prior to closing, certain related party creditors of Sabre (the ""**Creditors**"") agreed to settle approximately CAD$9.5 million in principal and interest in exchange for an aggregate of 30,490,883 Sabre Shares (the ""**Debt Settlement**""). For further details see our press release dated October 28, 2024. In addition, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,546,775 options to acquire Minera Alamos Shares (""**Minera Options**"") in exchange for the issued and outstanding options to acquire Sabre Shares. The Minera Options have exercise prices ranging from $0.26 to $2.02 per Minera Alamos Share. Upon completion of the Transaction (including the Debt Settlement), existing Minera Alamos and Sabre shareholders will own approximately 86% and 14% of Minera Alamos, respectively. As a condition of closing, Sabre also amended its existing gold purchase and sale agreement with Star Royalties Ltd. (the ""**GPSA**"") and in connection therewith Minera Alamos has agreed to grant to Star Royalties Ltd. (""**Star Royalties**"") security over the Sabre Shares post-closing, being consistent with the terms of the security which Star Royalties held prior to closing. Pursuant to the GPSA, Star Royalties already held security interests over substantially all of Sabre's assets, which will continue post-closing. The Sabre Shares are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX"") as of the close of trading on or around February 7, 2025. Minera Alamos will now apply for Sabre to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws. Information regarding the procedure for exchange of Sabre Shares for Minera Alamos Shares is provided in Sabre's management information circular dated December 3, 2024, related to the Sabre special meeting (the ""**Circular**""). The Circular and accompanying letter of transmittal are available under Sabre's profile at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BpwP7UYnz3). The listing of the issued Minera Shares remains subject to the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. **Settlement on Financial Advisory fees** Minera Alamos further announces that it has agreed to settle a payable (debt) with an arms length party (who was engaged by Sabre as financial advisor on the Transaction) in the amount of $858,000 by the issuance of 3,118,800 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.28 per share. The shares issuable in connection with this debt settlement shall be subject to receipt of approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and will be subject to a statutory hold period expiring four months and one day after issuance.

Help this 4-week old relatively new initiative avoid more of these awkward moments in the future by completing the short survey at the end of this post.* *** ###Headline Stories *** **RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot** After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy. **Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol** Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever.

The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&amp;ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company. **One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure** Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress?

The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate. **Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers** In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well.

467,Global,2024-10,"The Value Added by Ontologies: Organizations With vs Without-https://preview.redd.it/795eo4pbc0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1701143dfa70f60afbedad3a67942f0a73871533 # Introduction A company's vulnerabilities lie in its inability to see clearly. Clarity becomes the number one factor. Managing a business starts with having a clear and concrete view of everything that can be managed, and then taking actions based on expertise. There’s no way to execute at the top level without a clear and comprehensive view of the business! 💡 In this article I will discuss how ontologies help organizations to see clear in mountains of data. https://preview.redd.it/je97sbncc0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2fea7e61fb03fe8e3bcb4c6142e2e5f94366a8d # Data-Driven Insights and the Rise of Dashboards in Boardrooms The reason every organization wanted to work with data was to make their processes visible. The gradual evolution of enterprises becoming data-driven was inspired by the SaaS industry (on-premise first, later on cloud), migrating industries to applications, and enabling them to create and manage data during everyday operations. All companies now have CRMs and ERPs, often supplemented with best-of-breed (BoB) add-ons like product content management systems and social media data applications. Data is “the new gold” for one main reason: it provides insights into the enterprise. These insights would otherwise be hidden beneath the complex layers of daily activities integrated into the organization. oday, it's not just about visuals on dashboards. AI and LLMs now analyze the data through data mining and provide people with solutions, rather than leaving them to do all the thinking work. This is the key reason companies pursue data maturity, striving to become digital-driven organizations that collect and leverage data. But more on that later. # Example: SaaS and Databases in Logistics https://preview.redd.it/i6ddy1pjc0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11758b69d55a895a77a25d8cbb86f67b0299743c A logistics firm managing the incoming fleet of trucks and loading inventory directly into the warehouse. How would the management know where all products are stored and moving to, live, without a digital application? However, even these methods of business management are becoming “outdated.” It may seem ungrateful or overly critical to say that, but it's true. Enterprises using newer technologies, years ahead of “digitally driven” ones relying on ERPs and CRMs for daily management, are unlocking competitive edges every day. The data-driven organizations that were trumpeted as ""the future of all enterprise"" just a few years ago are now falling behind those adopting newer technologies. For any organization competing in the business world, every minute is crucial. Market share is being taken away in real-time, as visible on dashboards. # What Are These New Digital Technologies? https://preview.redd.it/w3ik34iuc0td1.png?width=420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb552c9b1b7d1ca9a65db70d14583cd402c0ab92 The ontology is a software layer brought to life to “make sense of data.” If big data is the fuel for your car, an ontology is the exterior, interior, and architecture that makes the car drive possible. In the business world the ontology is [described](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology/why-ontology/) as ""a shared source of truth for decision-making and decision capture across a large organization."" **Example: Ontology as the Foundation** Imagine an organization that is already data-driven, collecting data and using it to make day-to-day decisions. They want to understand how a delayed shipment from a port is affecting their sales, marketing, and accounting cycles, and what exact impact these delays will have across the business. Calculating this manually would be impossible. The ontology sees all the existing data and, through its software, makes sense of the impacts if one thing changes, as in this example. # How an Ontology Works https://preview.redd.it/w0zf4xhzc0td1.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0177674e7efe702cdbbc0a6d57877ff439b3e96 We, as humans, know the world through our relationship with it. We live in it, computers do not. But how do computers know what “things” in our world are, like partner businesses in the value chain, or “incoming orders,” etc.? Can a computing system ever really “know” anything at all? These are complex questions, but the framework on which an ontology operates is quite simple. **Conceptual Framework** https://preview.redd.it/ijd3jgq1d0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dcfa1e31df80506c9d7b9cad102c0affb030dd8 We know things through relationships they have with other things. For example, when flying a plane, gravity pulls it downward, creating resistance, but the engine’s speed generates force, reducing gravity’s effect. These are relationships governed by physical laws. We relate every object, actor, and law in a web of situations and relations. We also define objects within a conceptual framework of the world, setting clear boundaries on what they are and are not. An ontology can mimic this concept by analyzing data, identifying relationships between data points, and then reasoning through software. Ontologies are fundamentally designed to process and seem to “understand” the world through data. **Limitations of Compute** Because a computer holds data in forms of memory, encoded as bits and bytes, real-world “things” are stored as code. The limitations arise from the fact that computers perform millions of calculations, fetching and retrieving these bits based on system architecture. But this doesn't help us understand whether a computer ""knows"" anything. **Knowledge Through Ontologies** Ontologies can process real-time data and even tell you if an oil tanker leak, detected through IoT, is impacting quarterly financials and straying your organization from its goals. They can reveal insights faster than human analysis can. With large amounts of data, software can analyze it, still displaying answers after millions of operations in bits and bytes. But if you ask a computer what 100 sales orders will mean for this quarter’s numbers, it calculates using vast amounts of data and then returns a digitized answer. There’s no “[knowing](https://medium.com/granted/computers-are-dumb-and-what-that-means-for-us-e2bfe42a7e4f)” involved. # From Data Collection to AI-Driven Insights https://preview.redd.it/jcmtmsk8d0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbfc43e7f036ca24d66f2377f8c89093d542c059 The first large growth phase from the 2000s to 2020s was data collection. Now, AI and LLMs analyze trillions of data points and “make sense” of it. This evolution is starting today, with ontologies providing LLMs with a framework that helps them “understand” the organization; what it does, who the key players are, and how daily operations work. Ontologies, in this regard, study “what things in the real world are” and translate that into a digitized software layer. They are not digital twins, which are exact copies of reality in data format, but they give meaning to what things are for digital twins, aiding in the creation of fact-based representations of an enterprise. # Who Creates Ontologies? [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) is currently the only company that creates ontologies driving real-world results. Other data-focused companies attempt to solve problems through better data management, but Palantir’s ontology-based approach goes back 20 years, beginning with government and institutional use. Today, it helps people in governments and enterprises worldwide harness data to drive change. **User Stories** 1. Wendy's (Food Services). 2. Rio Tinto (Mining). 3.

468,Global,2024-07,"Internship Advice -Ultimate lurker here, hello everyone. I am currently a rising junior at umich majoring in geology and minoring in physics looking for some help with securing an internship for summer 2025. My research is mainly focused on mineral physics and high pressure experimentation, which has left me with a variety of weird laboratory skills. I also plan to finish field camp by the end of this summer. I have a strong interest in exploration in the oil/mining industry. Since it is my understanding that oil companies do not hire undergraduate interns, I am mainly looking at mining companies like barrick, albermarle, rio tinto, sibayne-stillwater, freeport-mcmoran, newmont, or any other smaller company. Now for some questions: Is it appropriate to reach out to current employees and ask about the company culture, typical workday, skills needed, etc? Are AGU/GSA conferences worth to attend for recruitment purposes? When does recruitment usually start for mining companies? Any other company recommendations besides in the mining industry? (enviro, hydrogeo, gov sector, etc) Do these programs offer housing during the job? Or is this something I would need to start saving for? (I am willing to relocate) How many positions do mining companies offer for interns? Thank you for reading my post, I look forward to reading your comments/suggestions.

470,Global,2024-06,"#NIOCORP ~ NIOBIUM &amp; TITANIUM in the news plus, Some Recent Critical Minerals News Articles &amp; a bit more....-# JUNE 17th, 2024~Why is there a domestic American critical minerals crisis? # [Why is there a domestic American critical minerals crisis? - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/why-is-there-a-domestic-american-critical-minerals-crisis/) https://preview.redd.it/uq3syzdyya7d1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a420be5d8648b9b907de767f2e5e4a2d66b34b Why has no one addressed the question: Is there a critical minerals’ supply crisis? And, if so, how did this crisis of critical minerals supply come about? The answer, at least to the second question, is probably because it would expose how greed overtook common sense and how credentials, alone, surpassed any requirements for logical thinking about foreseeable consequences based on openly available data, subject matter knowledge, and experience. More about that later. First, let’s look at the origins of the (global?) critical minerals’ supply crisis. As with all supply crises, it is a problem of demand exceeding supply. In this case, it is the failure of Western manufacturing to prepare for a rapid rise in demand from China for technology goods and services, and the subsequent (unprecedentedly) rapid build-up, by the Chinese government, of a massive in-country minerals processing capability and capacity to address their own domestic market deficit. This was seen by the Western manufacturing profit-driven managers as an opportunity rather than a competitive threat. But China’s rulers were not seeking profit; they were seeking domestic self-sufficiency and security. China’s rulers creation of a China that was to be completely independent of the rest of the world for minerals sourcing and processing, as well as manufacturing, was the goal, no matter what the short-term cost. Since China’s GDP and Gross Domestic Demand for Technology Products have grown simultaneously, since 2000, at a faster rate than that of any other nation in history, the Western manufacturing industry can be excused for “initially” missing the long term effects of such growth on the global consumer markets’ economy. Western governments and their captive economist class have come so late (in understanding the issues) to the party that their recent wild policy swings that threaten the Free Trade agenda put in place after WWII to prevent another resource-seeking world war can be seen as a pathetic lack of understanding of the foreseeable consequences of bad policy. The critical minerals’ “crisis” is that of the deglobalization of mineral supply chains. In the rapidly vanishing world of global free trade in minerals, they, the minerals, were “refined and processed into end-user-ready forms in the countries where those forms would be used to manufacture consumer and military products. China has created for itself, by aggressive acquisition of ownership or control, almost the entire suite of critical minerals necessary for a self-sufficient high-tech consumer product domestic (as well as export) economy. Simultaneously China built the world’s largest by far metal and mineral processing industry and has probably today also become the world’s largest consumer of and producer of military products in the world. ***China consumes today more than half of all of the metals and industrial minerals produced in the world! And, China processes more than half of the world’s metallic minerals into end-user friendly forms!*** We cannot hope to, nor should we keep pretending that we can completely supplant China for our critical mineral needs both for the military and the civilian markets. We do not have the time, domestic manufacturing expertise, or capital. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has attempted, for its own needs, to establish a total rare earth permanent magnet supply chain, independent of Chinese participation at any level. This attempt has been done through “investments” in companies with little or no track record in that supply chain. The recipients of that largesse have won by simply saying “We can do it” without passing a techno-economic due diligence, because the DoD does not have the internal capability to do one. The American private (consumer) manufacturing industry has also, so far, failed in its uncorrelated moves to create a secure and sufficient domestic supply of minerals and their processing necessary to free even a small fraction of its needs from Chinese dominance. The lack of subject matter expertise and the lack of techno-economic due diligence capability and the inability to find them by both the military and the civilian markets is the problem. ***Disclaimer:*** *The author of this* [*Investor.News*](http://Investor.News) *post, which is published by InvestorNews Inc., may or may not be a shareholder of any of the companies mentioned in this column.

Li and Albanese and senior ministers of both administrations met at Parliament House on Monday to discuss thorny issues, including lingering trade barriers, conflict between their militaries in international waters and China's desire to invest in critical minerals. \(Lukas Coch\/Pool Photo via AP\)](https://preview.redd.it/075472d6za7d1.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25bfc8b00338d0c513bc8d75cb85b4856bf1dbf0) MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Chinese Premier [Li Qiang](https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-li-qiang-albanese-7d77beb5df26582e2c56ab4cb5fedd1e) has ended his Australian tour on Tuesday in the west coast city of Perth where he has focused on China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links. Perth is the capital of Western Australia state, which provided 39% of the world's iron ore last year. Iron ore is one of Australia's most lucrative exports. Analysts say the commodity was spared the type of trade bans Beijing imposed on other Australian exports as bilateral relations soured three years ago because the steel-making ingredient was crucial to Chinese industrial growth. Li last week became the first Chinese premier to visit New Zealand then Australia in seven years. He left Perth late Tuesday for Malaysia, where he'll be China's first premier to visit since 2015. While in Perth, China’s second-most powerful leader after President Xi Jinping inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility. Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron.” “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit. The Perth facility is testing technology on hydrogen, ammonia and batter power for trains, ships, trucks and heavy mining equipment. Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals. The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles. # Australia shares [U.S. concerns](https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles-evs-solar-2024ba735c47e04a50898a88425c5e2c) over China’s global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector. Citing Australia’s national interests, Treasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote in an opinion piece published in Perth’s main newspaper, The West Australian, on Tuesday that his government was acting to ensure foreign investment “continues to serve our national interests.” “This includes reforming the foreign investment framework so that it’s more efficient, more transparent and more effective at managing risk,” Albanese wrote. Forrest said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated. “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said. Qiang and Albanese flew to Perth in separate planes late Monday from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House. Both leaders attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.

471,Global,2021-03,"PLTR will moon; hold tight astronauts-I will just tell you why. 1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX. A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, &amp; **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&amp;GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc. 2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on. 3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself. 4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon. 5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65. 6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under. 7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business. 8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now? 9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss. 10) $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after Q4 earnings 11) if investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. 12) It's ok that the some dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them. PLTR, a baby of Cathie Wood &amp; Alex Karp. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀TLDR: PLTR 🚀 , buy PLTR.",Reddit

474,Global,2020-07,"DD: KDK.V Kodiak Copper Corp-YOOO degens are you tired of chasing popping mining corps with charts that look like raging green dildos, only to have the sp reverse and flatten out after you buy them leaving you wondering whether or not your girlfriend's dad's boyfriend's cousin ever even cared? Get ahead of the game and take a look at this: [Kodiak Copper Corp (KDK.V)](https://kodiakcoppercorp.com/) Kodiak is currently drilling a copper GOLD project in southern BC. WAIT STOP DON'T TUNE OUT THE PROJECT: The MPD Copper Gold Deposit: Previously drilled to ONLY 125 metres by Newmont and Rio Tinto over the last 35 years. From their website ""The MPD Project is located in the Quesnel Trough, British Columbia’s primary copper-producing belt that hosts Teck Resource’s world-class Highland Valley Mine, IMPERIAL METALS’ Mount Polley Mine, and Centerra Gold’s Mount Milligan Mine (see Table 1). The MPD project’s Nicola Belt geology has many similar characteristics to the neighbouring alkalic porphyry systems at the Copper Mountain Mine to the south and New Gold’s New Afton Mine to the north."" &amp;#x200B; &lt;SO THIS IS A GOOD AREA TO DRILL (and nice and close to Van City too)&gt; &amp;#x200B; The story gets better. Chris Taylor saw something under the ontario soil that interested him. His work at IMPERIAL METALS familiarized him with the geology of big deposits. He has gone on to CATAPULT shareholders of GBR from $0-$18 using an approach of drilling non stop and creating an avalanche of hype around his company. Taylor is EXTREMELY familiar with the area that KDK is in because he cut his teeth at IMPERIAL METALS which also have a mine in the same area. &amp;#x200B; &lt;ABOUT CHRIS TAYLOR ATTITUDE TOWARDS SHARE STRUCTURE&gt; Most mining corps have 45 trillion shares in the float which is a ton of paper that makes share price moves difficult. Chris taylor understands how to jack up share prices. here he is explaining his mentality: [https://youtu.be/Kum4NjX6VNs?t=412](https://youtu.be/Kum4NjX6VNs?t=412) TLDR: KEEP THE SHARE COUNT LOW&lt; DRILL THE LIVING FCK OUT OF THE ROCK&lt; DO NOT DILUTE&lt; REWARD THE EMPLOYEES AND EARLY INVESTORS WITH SHARE PRICE MOVEMENT. whats more, he has a dislike of handing out equity and doing dilutive financing as a shareholder and mining stock gambler I like that. &amp;#x200B; So with that mentality in mind we come to his new project. MARCH 24 2020. Chris Taylor becomes president of Dunnedin Resources "" We chose the Kodiak bear for our name to honour our company’s founder and chairman Chris Taylor and his fantastic exploration success with our sister company Great Bear Resources. It symbolises that we are applying the strategy that made Great Bear successful in the gold space to the copper space: focusing on historically drilled brownfield assets that have been under-appreciated, in producing belts, with excellent infrastructure and year-round accessibility. We re-evaluate holistically using new methods and technologies and establish new theories and models for exploration. "" &amp;#x200B; Another plus for Kodiak is that they are a part of the [Discovery Group of companies](https://www.discoverygroup.ca/) which is a capital investment group which is made up of high networth investors who can finance the company. Their goal is usually to get their projects bought out. This is a huge safety net for Kodiak and a insurance policy that Kodiak isnt going to suddenly fold up and leave with your money. &amp;#x200B; A LAND OF COINCIDENCES SO Chris Taylor is the President of the group and also the reason why the company exists. What about the current [Kodiak Copper CEO Claudia Tornquist.](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Claudia-Tornquist-0BJY98-E/biography/) Claudia is also CEO of [Silver One resources](https://www.silverone.com/) and has a surprisingly high profile. Prior to venturing out and building her own companies, she was VP of Business Development at Sandstorm Gold (NYSE:SAND) which is interesting because VP business development at a gold royalties corp involves dealing with selling and buying prospective pieces of land to new companies (like the one shes working on now????) She has also been the GM of RIO FUCKING TINTO (NYSE: RIO) -who originally drilled the project she is now working on btw - which is one of the biggest industrial metals corps in the world. What does all this mean? Kodiak is currently trading for around $0.49/share. Kodiak has only 30 million shares (mcap: under 20M) and appears to be gearing up for their 2020 drilling season. They expect first results in august. If the results are good. The SP will whipsaw up because a 20m marketcap is nothing and even if it goes to 60m the sp will go to $1.60. giving you an easy 3 bagger just like that. If it reports a GOOD hole result and the mcap goes to like 100 or 200 mill youre riding the rocket to neverneverland. looking at a sp of like $2 plus. &amp;#x200B; TLDR SP: 1.20-2.50 END OF AUGUST.

I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients. PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day: [You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/opd8qiutdph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4bf46f2978e194792814abf31e84c3e19fa6632) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… # Big. # Fucking. # Deal. To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp. * First they ignore you. * Then they laugh at you. * Then they fight you. * Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries. * Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond. It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world. If they’re in, I’m in. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Table of Contents:** 1.

Musings on Earnings and Unlocking \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee. You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a [Keyser Söze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5k73jx2mIc) position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. Why? I like the stock, a lot. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day** Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up: &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lpzxhuse5ph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e677cb560749bb8cbeeee1a64d4ac2a731ced48 Four things stood out to me: **Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient. The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/) Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day. I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult. **Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc. The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. **Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force **DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval: [Palantir is the IL-ist SaaS on the market](https://preview.redd.it/eo8dcuir5ph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2c02e0131256508c34eeb0c2cdaeb26bc2a2eb) Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism: * Slow down 15-20% * Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon * For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points * Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic * Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations * Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation: &gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way* &gt; &gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students* &gt; &gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.* &gt; &gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.* I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power. \_\_\_\_\_ **#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit** One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

476,Global,2024-03,"MAR 27, 2024 WGO.V WHITE GOLD CORP. IDENTIFIES MULTIPLE PROSPECTIVE IP CHARGEABILITY ANOMALIES ON TWO LARGE MULTI-ELEMENT PORPHYRY TARGETS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE CASINO COPPER-GOLD PORPHYRY DEPOSIT, YUKON, CANADA-https://preview.redd.it/ubh9aj8rlvqc1.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ef2771b784390b0b917e70b76466c5b830c68bb TORONTO, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W** ) (the “Company”) is pleased to provide an exploration update on the Bridget and Isaac porphyry targets located on the Pedlar and Hayes properties, respectively. Exploration work completed during 2023 included Induced Polarization (IP) chargeability and resistivity survey lines and hyperspectral analysis on 2022 prosecting rock samples. All data collected thus far on these large early-stage targets continue to support a porphyry deposit model. The Pedlar and Hayes properties are situated in the southern part of the Company’s 315,000 hectare (3,150 km 2 ) land package in the White Gold District, west-central Yukon (Figure 1). Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s Casino copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry deposit (Measured &amp; Indicated Resources of 7.6 Blb copper and 14.5 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 3.3 Blb copper and 6.6 Moz gold) sits approximately 30 km southwest and 40 km west of the Bridget and Isaac targets respectively. Casino is one of the largest undeveloped copper-gold projects in Canada, and since 2021 has seen strategic investments by major partners including Rio Tinto Canada Inc. and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. The Pedlar and Hayes properties are also located 40 km and 72 km southeast, respectively, of the Company’s flagship White Gold project which contains an estimated 1,152,900 ounces of gold in Indicated Resources and 942,400 ounces of gold in Inferred Resources ( 1) Terry Brace, Vice President of Exploration commented: “We are encouraged by results of the 2023 IP test lines at the Bridget and Isaac targets which identified new anomalies and structures that overall correlate well with the soil geochemistry anomalies and current structural interpretations. The new IP looked deeper than any previous geophysical surveys and demonstrates potential at depth beneath these large multi-element soil anomalies. The test results warrant full IP survey coverage over the target areas which will aid in mapping these systems at depth in support of future diamond drill testing.” Shawn Ryan, co-founder, Chief Technical Advisor and Director, commented further: “The Bridget target has an interesting history as it was one of four top prospects that was first discovered back in 1972 when Silver Standard Mines conducted an extensive 14,000 plus regional silt survey looking for another Casino. During the large regional silt survey, Silver Standard also made the Minto Copper discovery and eventually focused all their attention on that target. I staked the Bridget prospect back in 2004, and since then the property has seen extensive soil sampling programs, airborne radiometric surveys and shallow RAB drilling. The soil sampling program revealed a large copper, molybdenum and bismuth soil anomaly. The molybdenum anomaly (2 to 322 ppm) measures 4 km by 1.7 km and coincides with a very discrete bismuth anomaly (2 to 154 ppm) of 3 km by 1.4 km and a copper core anomaly (50 to 711 ppm) measuring 2.8 km by 1.3 km. A deep penetrating dipole-dipole IP survey was undertaken in summer 2023 with one line over the core of the soil anomaly and the results clearly show a textbook porphyry geophysical signature of resistivity lows and chargeability high anomalies sitting below the anomalous soils. It’s now recommended to follow up with more IP survey lines to cover this large developing porphyry target. I look forward to first diamond drill holes into this exciting target.” An overview of the Pedlar and Hayes properties, including the Bridget and Isaac targets, was provided previously in a news release dated April 5, 2023 which is available on the Company’s website ( [https://whitegoldcorp.ca/news/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zlIrJTE0xhipjC9X2HiUzNYkkUCI-d0UNJxdbPyapwWSVSglCBs0xs6-q7PvzfQGGVok_tPuQMUNzvHWUSCGAXLI1475kaDseQsiVYlNtAqU2_OUVHnJ4-x5ifQOS52D) ) and on SEDAR+.

It is geochemically zoned with a molybdenum-copper-bismuth core and a silver-zinc-lead-tungsten halo. * At Bridget, one 1 st priority and four 2 nd priority chargeability anomalies were identified, with target depths ranging from 40 to 330 m. The chargeability anomalies underly a large molybdenum-copper soil anomaly, and a zone of moderate to strong chargeability to the southwest appears to mark a controlling WNW (290°) striking fault which correlates with anomalous lead-zinc-arsenic in soils. * The Isaac soil anomaly on the Hayes property is a recently discovered target which measures 2 km E-W by 1.5 km N-S, and is interpreted to represent a copper-molybdenum porphyry target. It is geochemically zoned with a bismuth-arsenic-copper core and a silver-zinc-lead halo. * At Isaac, four 1 st priority, three 2 nd priority and one 3 rd priority chargeability anomalies were identified, with target depths ranging from 50 to 550 m. The bismuth and copper core of the soil anomaly is underlain by multiple chargeability anomalies (S1, S2, M1 and W1 on Line 1E) which sit above a resistivity low. Anomalous lead, zinc, and silver, which form a halo around the core, are coincident with fault structures on the south side and north side of the survey area which trend NE (065°) and NW (290°) respectively. * 2022 prospecting rock samples from both the Bridget and Isaac targets show anomalous trace element enrichments, including copper, molybdenum and silver, consistent with proximal porphyry copper-style mineralization. * Hyperspectral analysis results for the prosecting rock samples at both Bridget and Isaac show alteration mineralogy consistent with a porphyry deposit model. * The Company is currently planning its fully funded 2024 exploration program, focusing on its existing significant gold resources, new high grade gold discoveries and other high priority gold and multi-element targets. The Company will arrange a webinar to provide a more detailed overview of the 2023 exploration results and plans for 2024 at that time. Details to be announced in due course. **Regional Setting – The Dawson Range** The Dawson Range forms an east-southeast trending mountain range which hosts several important mineral deposits and prospects (Figure 2) including the Casino porphyry Copper-Gold deposit in the west. In the southeast near the community of Carmacks, the Minto Mine contains resources of 356 Mlb copper, 189 Koz gold, and 1.7 Moz silver in Indicated Resources and 370 Mlb copper, 207 Koz gold, and 1.9 Moz silver in Inferred Resources ( 5 ) , and the Carmacks Copper project hosts 652 Mlb copper, 302 Koz gold, 3.8 Moz silver in Measured and Indicated Resources and 38 Mlb copper, 13 Koz gold, and 215 Koz silver in Inferred Resources ( 6 ) (Granite Creek Copper Ltd.), both interpreted to represent metamorphosed copper-gold-silver porphyry deposits. Porphyry deposits in the Dawson Range can be divided into 2 major ages, Late Triassic (Minto, Carmacks) and Late Cretaceous (Casino, Cash, Revenue). In addition to porphyry mineralization, epithermal, skarn, and polymetallic to gold-dominant mineralized veins, breccias and fracture zones also occur throughout the Dawson Range ( 7 ) **2023 IP Surveys** In August 2023, Simcoe Geoscience Limited (Simcoe) carried out 7.2 line-km of time domain induced polarization (IP) chargeability and resistivity surveying at the Bridget and Isaac targets using their wireless 2D Alpha IP™ system (see About IP Survey below). At Bridget, a single 3.0 km long IP test line (line 1N) oriented NE-SW was completed using a dipole-dipole configuration. At Isaac, two IP test lines totaling 4.2 km long were oriented perpendicular to each other at NE-SW (line 4N) and NW-SE (line 1E) using a dipole-pole-dipole configuration. Both configurations can detect anomalies up to 600+ m depth. **IP Results** At Bridget, five chargeability anomalies were identified on Line 1N (Figure 3), including one 1 st priority anomaly (S1) and four 2 nd priority anomalies (M1-M4). Anomaly S1 has a target depth of 130 m and is characterized by strong chargeability and low resistivity. Target depths on the second priority anomalies range from 40 m (M3, M4) to a maximum of 330 m (M1). These are characterized by moderate to high chargeability and low to high resistivity. The Bridget chargeability anomalies are plotted in relation to soil geochemistry results in Figure 4 (molybdenum, copper, lead, zinc) and Figure 5 (copper). The chargeability anomalies generally correspond with a zone of low resistivity which underlie a large molybdenum-copper soil anomaly. A zone of moderate (M1) to strong (S1) chargeability in the southwest delineates a controlling west-northwest (WNW, 290°) striking fault structure, closely correlated with lead, zinc, and arsenic soil anomalies. To the northeast, a similar WNW (295°) anomaly in lead,...[Content truncated]",Reddit
477,Global,2024-02,"FEB 23, 2024 TLO.TO TALON METALS SELECTED TO LEAD PUBLIC TESTIMONY BEFORE US TREASURY REGARDING CRITICAL MINERALS TAX CREDIT-https://preview.redd.it/ek4wgbyudelc1.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=102164aeae80232ce468446b491faabfd6462daa Washington, D.C.--(Newsfile Corp. - February 23, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC PINK: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") Chief External Affairs Officer and Head of Climate Strategy Todd Malan was selected to lead the public testimony during yesterday's US Treasury's public hearing on Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit for Critical Minerals. *""It was an honor to share Talon's perspective on how the 45X tax credit for critical minerals was intended by Congress to support domestic mineral extraction. We shared two proposals that we think respond to the Treasury Department's concerns about foreign sourced minerals qualifying for a domestic production incentive. If our proposals are adopted, they will provide long-term financial support to the domestic production of eligible critical minerals like nickel,""* Malan commented after addressing the Treasury/IRS panel. He added, ""*As the IRA's support for secure supply chains in critical minerals is being challenged by Chinese oversupply of these minerals which is driving down prices, a comprehensive 45X tax credit that includes extraction of raw materials from the geology of the United States would be very timely support for the critical mineral supply chain.""* Section 45X of the *Inflation Reduction Act* (IRA) is a production tax credit intending to incentivize investments in the full manufacturing supply chain of clean energy systems like electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Section 45X applies to the manufacturing of equipment used in solar, wind, hydrogen and batteries and also credits critical minerals production applying to specific elements in the periodic table. The list includes nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals that are all present in the high-grade ores that Talon plans to extract from the underground mine at the Tamarack Nickel Project (which is currently in the environmental review process conducted by Minnesota regulators and tribal sovereign governments as part of the State's permitting process). The 45X production tax credit for critical minerals is equal to 10% of the annual production cost of producing the specified element to a certain level of purity. Remarkably, the 45X tax credit for critical minerals does not decline over time or expire. Under IRS precedent, ""production cost"" would usually include the cost of acquiring raw materials along with employee costs, energy, depreciation of equipment etc. However, the US Treasury indicated in draft regulations issued on December 15, 2023, that it was withholding allowing the cost of raw materials from the calculation of production cost for the 45X critical minerals tax credit to further study potential abuse and how it could allow raw materials cost to be included consistent with the intent of Congress. Today's hearing was part of an effort to obtain input from experts and stakeholders on this specific question. Talon believes that Congress created this extraordinary tax credit for critical minerals to benefit the entire U.S. supply chain for critical minerals from mining to recycling. Also, the statutory language clearly states that the 45X tax credit only applies to production that occurs within the United States or its possessions. In the case of applicable critical minerals, the mineral *is* the component, so it stands to reason that only the cost of extraction of such mineral (in its raw form) occurring in the US or its possessions should qualify for the 45X tax credit in calculating the cost of production of such mineral. Malan explained to the Treasury and IRS panel that Talon remains committed to President Biden's vision for responsible mining and securing America's critical mineral supply chains. He pointed out that producing sustainably sourced critical minerals has national security implications given Chinese and Russian dominance of critical minerals like nickel. Malan outlined Talon's recommendation to the Treasury that a taxpayer producing an applicable critical mineral as specified in the law should be able to include the full cost of purchasing the ""source material"" or ore in the calculation of the 45X tax credit. To include raw materials cost in the calculation of production cost of the critical mineral to the specific level of purity, the taxpayer would need to obtain: * Certification that the raw materials (mined ore that is physically processed prior to refining) has a chemical characteristic (assay) that indicates that it is the source of the final eligible critical mineral; * Certification that the raw materials were extracted from the geology of the United States; * Certification that such supplier has not itself claimed the 45X tax credit with regard to any of the same costs; and * Certification that such supplier has not provided certification related to any of the same costs to any other entity. Talon believes this ""Buy American"" proposal for adding raw materials extraction cost to the calculation of production cost using definitions under § 1.263A - applied to raw materials extracted in the US -- is easily administrable, addresses the concerns of the Treasury Department that it must ensure that ""foreign minerals"" cannot benefit from the 45X tax credit, and is consistent with the intent of Congress in enacting 45X as applied to critical minerals: to cover the full US sourced supply chain required to produce eligible applicable critical minerals.

(TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") received confirmation on January 30, 2024 from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources that its Administrative Board approved the Company's application (through its subsidiaries) for 23,000 acres of additional mineral leases in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The 23,000 acres of mineral leases augment the [Company's announcement on August 10, 2022](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/AM30ncMP8n) that it entered into an option and earn-in agreement (the **""Option Agreement""**) with UPX Minerals Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sweetwater Royalties) (**""UPX""**) to acquire up to an 80% ownership interest in the mineral rights over a land package comprised of approximately 400,000 acres located in the Upper Peninsula of the State of Michigan. This land package was originally assembled by Henry Ford and owned for approximately 70 years by the Ford Motor Company. The combined land package covers highly prospective terrain within 1.7 miles (2.8km) of the high-grade Eagle Nickel Mine (the only active nickel mine in the USA today) and is only 0.4 miles (0.6km) from the Humboldt Mill (the concentrator which currently processes the raw nickel ore from the Eagle Nickel Mine). [On September 12, 2023, the Department of Defense selected Talon for $20.6 million in grant funding](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZAezaie1yD) from the *Defense Production Act* to explore and discover more high-grade nickel mineralization in Michigan and Minnesota. Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon said: *""Our exploration team's sole focus is to discover more high-grade nickel deposits in the United States. With funding from the Department of Defense, Talon will bring its proven approach to exploration drilling and geophysical analysis to try to discover new high-grade nickel and copper mineralization in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, currently the only region with a nickel mine in the United States.""* Mr. van Rooyen continued: *""Within the mineral sourcing requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act's electric vehicle tax credits, minerals sourced domestically enjoy the highest level of preference under the law. The United States is currently dependent on foreign countries such as Russia and China for nickel, which is an untenable supply chain vulnerability. This extraordinary context is why Talon is advancing its proposed Tamarack Underground Mine proposal through the Minnesota environmental review process while also exploring for additional high-grade deposits in both Minnesota and Michigan.""* *He continued, ""Mineral exploration and geophysics are science but also an art. It is not just finding a needle in a haystack; it's finding a needle in a haystack if the haystack was in a dark barn and you're wearing dark sunglasses. The haystack in this case was buried deep underground millions of years ago. Talon's experienced team is using cutting edge technology, our own drill rigs and in-house drill teams to find more nickel in America. We are conducting drilling and geophysics in Minnesota on a 24/7 basis and are excited to get started in Michigan this spring.""* *""The Michigan DNR approval process included opportunity for extensive public comment. We are planning to host a community ""Open House"" in the spring prior to any drilling and we have had a number of information sharing meetings with proximate Tribal sovereign governments to discuss our initial area of interest for mineral exploration, seek their feedback and discuss the potential contribution of tribal knowledge in our fieldwork,""* said Cody Mayer, Community &amp; Tribal Engagement Liaison for Talon. Mayer is based in Marquette, Michigan and is the Company's first Michigan based employee. He continued, *""Exploration drilling and geophysics is essentially about understanding what Michigan has in its natural resource wealth. Having this information means policymakers are better able to plan for secure domestic supply chains in the future. If this exploration process results in the discovery of a mineable resource like the Eagle Mine, which has successfully operated in this region since 2014, it will ultimately be up to society to decide if that newly discovered resource will be extracted and contribute to domestic supply chains. For now, Talon is committed to protecting the environment during this exploration phase, being transparent with the community by sharing information about our operations, plans and exploration results.""* **ABOUT TALON** Talon is a TSX-listed base metals company in a joint venture with [Rio Tinto](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/arYmatYJKo) on the high-grade [Tamarack Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Project](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2EeRktZGjM) located in central Minnesota.

The report added: “Government policies, regulations, and taxation frameworks can significantly impact the mining industry. Political stability, legal frameworks, mining codes, and fiscal policies affect investment attractiveness, licensing, and permitting processes. Copper is essential for constructing infrastructure projects such as buildings, bridges, and electrical systems. Hence, government initiatives and policies promoting infrastructure development can significantly boost the market. The mining industry, mainly of copper, will likely increase significantly due to increased investment in construction and construction projects. For example, over 100 smart city projects are underway worldwide, creating tremendous opportunities for the construction industry. Rapid urbanization in emerging economies and ongoing construction projects worldwide lead to increased copper consumption.” Active mining companies in the markets this week include **American Pacific Mining Corp.** (OTCQX: USGDF) (CSE: USGD) (FWB: 1QC), **Rio Tinto Group** (NYSE: RIO), **Freeport-McMoRan Inc.** (NYSE: FCX), **Lundin Mining Corporation** (NASDAQ: LUMI) (TSX: LUN), **Filo Corp.** (OTCQX: FLMMF) (TSX: FIL). Fortune Business Insights continued: “Furthermore, copper is also widely used in renewable energy infrastructure and EVs to build electrical wiring, transformers, batteries, and charging infrastructure, and the regulation related to the adoption of renewable energy and EVs will also push the demand for mining of copper. The primary driver of this industry is the demand for copper as a raw material in various sectors, including construction, infrastructure development, electrical and electronics, transportation, and manufacturing. Furthermore, increasing population, urbanization, and industrialization in developing countries have increased copper demand.” **American Pacific Mining Corp.

See full press release by clicking link below to view Tables 1-3 for all new assay results and corresponding disclosure notes. Peter Mercer, Senior Vice President, Advanced Projects commented, “The final assay results from our 2023 resource definition drilling at the Palmer Project have exceeded expectations with tremendous copper grades and aggregate metals values over significant widths. Last year’s drilling has extended the mineralized envelope beyond the current MRE model. Our team is actively working to update our 3D geological model. Preliminary interpretations have highlighted several priority target areas for follow-up drilling in 2024. In addition, the knowledge gained from this year’s drilling will provide valuable insights as we re-evaluate and rank the numerous VMS showings throughout the mineralized district.” **Summary of Latest Assay Results and Key Takeaways -** The 2023 diamond drill program successfully targeted high-priority areas in two unique mineralized lenses, Zone 1 and Zone 2-3, which together make up the South Wall Zone of the Palmer deposit. The third and final batch of assay results reported in this release consists of 13 drillholes (seven at Zone 1, five at Zone 2-3, and one geotechnical drill hole at the RW Oxide Zone). See Company news releases dated October 18 and November 14, 2023, for previous 2023 assay results. Three primary takeaways from the latest results: 1. High-grade copper mineralization with strong metal zoning demonstrated in the core of Zone 1. 2. Cu-Zn mineralization extends beyond the limits of the mineral resource estimate (“MRE”) in Zone 1 highlighting the potential for mineral resource expansion and the discovery of additional lenses downdip and along strike. 3. Increased confidence in the current MRE and the 2023 infill drilling provides better methodology for assessing feasibility-level drill space requirements. The Company is incorporating all 2023 results into its 3D geological model and completing further interpretation/analysis and target ranking in preparation for the upcoming 2024 drill season. ***CONTINUED*** **…** **Read this full press release and more news for** **American Pacific Mining** **at:** [https://www.financialnewsmedia.com/news-usgd/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SGYwzF7-oFoGFrnUvsh-xWuijSRAa650IkdtQ3DtYsL4yyanikDYxql2q7dBw-LFEAIJDUqBnElJwvAGzjjoDlnPlEyNurgta546SGxW5QtDwOaItK9e7GTrHQuIOZX6KrhEdFqzbrv2VQ-oDOqjsjvlPSNCwNiFvTj1KGEOip8=) *Other recent developments in the mining industry of note include:* **Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO)** recently [held](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VPyhDNhrKaUAIN8E9yJydHrLgUvNZjcQ3MXhL5iveHFWR68HImpA91dXG3LZm48dtyIgACXb9YzDJVDbnAJbaS4bmlECDR77jhy2yLBwfby1ZY560ZjAes6DF5UP25pqewmLhkswaxps82d30W09TXPvtFmAzrCJ7vukL6vqC8I=) its 2023 Investor Seminar in Sydney, where it updated on progress in its long-term strategy of investing with discipline to strengthen operations, deliver growth in a decarbonising world and continue to generate attractive shareholder returns.

The high-stakes meeting underscored how one of the largest untapped copper deposits in North America has become a lightning rod in the broader struggle over America’s mineral security, environmental protection, and Indigenous rights. The timing was no accident. Just one day earlier, a federal appeals court issued a temporary injunction halting the transfer of federal forest land to the mining giants, delaying the project once again. For President Trump, who has made reshoring supply chains and boosting resource independence central to his agenda, the ruling was more than a setback. He lashed out at opponents online, branding them “radical left activists” and accusing them of serving the interests of foreign competitors rather than American workers. **Resolution Copper’s Promise and Peril** The Resolution Copper project, located about 60 miles east of Phoenix, is touted as one of the richest copper ore bodies ever discovered. If developed, it could supply as much as 25 percent of US copper demand for decades, according to company estimates. The mine promises billions in economic activity, thousands of jobs, and a direct boost to industries ranging from clean energy to defense manufacturing. Copper is essential for everything from electric vehicles and power grids to missiles and smartphones, making it one of the most strategically important minerals of the 21st century. Yet for the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other Indigenous communities, the project represents something very different. At the heart of the dispute is Oak Flat, a site considered sacred for centuries, used for religious ceremonies, prayer, and gathering of medicinal plants. Tribal leaders warn that the massive underground mine would devastate the land, swallowing sacred ground in a crater nearly two miles wide and more than a thousand feet deep. For them, the fight is not simply about resource development but about cultural survival. **The Legal Deadlock** The injunction issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily halted a land exchange mandated by Congress in 2014 under President Barack Obama. That provision, tucked into a defense spending bill, required the US Forest Service to transfer Oak Flat to Resolution Copper once environmental reviews were completed. Opponents argue those reviews were insufficient, failing to account for risks such as tailings dam breaches or pipeline failures. They also claim the government undervalued the land, excluding the immense copper reserves buried far below. The appeals court will hear arguments on the merits of the case later this year, but for now the future of Resolution Copper hangs in limbo. The companies insist the pause is temporary. Resolution Copper released a statement calling the court’s decision a hurdle but not a roadblock, stressing that its plan was shaped through years of consultation with tribal groups and environmental experts. The US Forest Service, for its part, has argued that it has little discretion, since Congress already ordered the land swap. **Trump’s Energy and Security Agenda** For President Trump, the project represents more than an economic opportunity. He has repeatedly linked domestic copper production to national security, arguing that America cannot afford to depend on foreign sources for critical minerals. With global copper prices hovering near historic highs and geopolitical tensions with China intensifying, the case for US self-sufficiency is growing louder. Trump has warned that blocking the mine undermines America’s ability to compete in clean energy, defense, and advanced technology. At the White House meeting, BHP’s Mike Henry emphasized the project’s potential to create “thousands of high-value local jobs in Arizona and billions in economic activity across America.” Rio Tinto executives echoed that message, presenting the mine as not only profitable but essential to meeting the country’s long-term mineral needs. **A Clash That Won’t Go Away** The battle over Oak Flat has already lasted two decades, and the latest injunction ensures it will continue for months if not years. For mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto, Resolution Copper is a crown jewel they are unwilling to abandon. For Native American tribes and environmentalists, it is a line in the sand they cannot allow to be crossed. The stakes are immense. Beyond the billions in projected revenue and the thousands of jobs at risk, the dispute has become a test of how America balances industrial ambition with cultural preservation and environmental responsibility. With copper at the heart of the energy transition and defense readiness, the outcome will ripple far beyond Arizona’s desert. **Conclusion** The Oval Office meeting highlighted the growing collision between America’s drive for mineral independence and the rights of communities fighting to preserve their heritage. Whether Resolution Copper becomes a cornerstone of US resource security or another casualty of political and legal battles remains uncertain. What is clear is that the project has become a flashpoint in the larger debate over how far the nation is willing to go in pursuit of economic growth, security, and energy transition.",Reddit
483,Global,2024-11,"UUUU: The next Rio Tinto (RIO)-TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 80+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 150 USD per share. Hi Everyone, UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher. Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value ~$80/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the high 80s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take ~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year. Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later. That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently. Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD. Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects). I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that (edit: I can now, Radium-226 goes for 10 million USD/gram, if UUUU can even make a pound of that its 500million in revenue and they're aiming to go to commercial levels after 2026 and starting small in 2025) but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell. The company currently has 140 million in liquidity, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales. Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly really lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be ~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam. Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space a...[Content truncated]",Reddit

490,Global,2025-05,"Jakob Stausholm’s Exit Rocks Rio Tinto’s Core-Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/jakob-stausholm-s-exit-rocks-rio-tinto-s-core](https://www.juniorstocks.com/jakob-stausholm-s-exit-rocks-rio-tinto-s-core) A Leadership Shakeup Rocks Rio Tinto and the Mining Industry https://preview.redd.it/urfw3krhic2f1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d58af40d5732afe2dde15474fcec1d9e8301af In a bombshell announcement that’s sent shockwaves through the mining world, Rio Tinto (ASX, LON: RIO) revealed on Thursday that CEO Jakob Stausholm will step down later this year, capping a nearly five-year tenure that saw the mining giant pivot toward energy transition metals and grapple with a controversial past. The news, as unexpected as a plot twist in a Hollywood thriller, has left analysts and investors scrambling to make sense of the sudden departure. Stausholm, who took the helm in 2021 after joining Rio in 2018, steered the company through turbulent waters following the infamous destruction of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelters in Western Australia. The incident, which cost his predecessor Jean-Sébastien Jacques his job, thrust Stausholm into the spotlight with a mandate to rebuild trust with stakeholders, Indigenous groups, and investors. By all accounts, he delivered—expanding Rio Tinto’s portfolio into high-demand commodities like copper, lithium, and aluminium while championing stronger environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. In a LinkedIn post that radiated pride but offered no clues about his exit, Stausholm called leading Rio Tinto “an honour” and emphasized that it’s “business as usual” while the company hunts for his successor. “A rigorous process is already underway,” he wrote, leaving the mining world buzzing with speculation about who’ll fill his shoes. **A Surprise Exit Sparks Questions** The announcement caught analysts off guard, with Berenberg’s Richard Hatch calling it “a big surprise” that “doesn’t feel that natural.” BMO’s Alexander Pearce echoed the sentiment, noting Stausholm’s relatively short tenure and crediting him with bolstering Rio’s position in future-facing metals. So, why now? Rio Tinto remained tight-lipped about the reasons behind Stausholm’s departure, leaving room for speculation about internal pressures or a strategic shift. Internally, iron ore chief Simon Trott and chief commercial officer Bold Baatar are rumored as frontrunners to take the top job. Meanwhile, analysts expect Rio to cast a wide net, though competition looms large—rival BHP is also on the hunt for a new CEO as Mike Henry prepares to exit within the next year. Talk about a mining leadership shakeup! **Stausholm’s Legacy: Bold Moves and Big Bets** Stausholm’s tenure wasn’t without its triumphs. The Danish executive expanded Rio Tinto’s iron ore empire beyond its Pilbara stronghold, securing approvals for the colossal Simandou project in Guinea, set to kick off production later this year. He also orchestrated a $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium and inked a $900 million lithium joint venture with Chile’s state-owned Codelco, cementing Rio’s foothold in the Lithium Triangle’s brine riches. Beyond growth, Stausholm faced shareholder heat, including a high-profile campaign led by Palliser Capital and over 100 investors to rethink Rio’s dual listing structure in London and Sydney. The proposal was shot down earlier this month, but it underscored the intense scrutiny Stausholm navigated with finesse. “Jakob restored trust with key stakeholders, aligned our portfolio with high-demand commodities, and set a compelling growth trajectory,” said Rio Tinto chair Dominic Barton, tipping his hat to Stausholm’s leadership. **Fortescue Joins the Exit Parade** As if one bombshell wasn’t enough, the mining sector got another jolt just an hour after Rio’s announcement. Fortescue (ASX: FMG) revealed that its energy chief, Mark Hutchinson, is also stepping down, with chief operating officer Shelley Robertson retiring as well. Former Argentine rugby captain Agustin Pichot will take the reins of Fortescue’s growth and energy division, tasked with driving its green energy ambitions. Talk about a double whammy for Australia’s mining giants! **What’s Next for Rio Tinto?** With Stausholm’s exit looming, all eyes are on Rio Tinto’s next move. Will the company tap an internal heavyweight or bring in fresh blood to lead its charge into the energy transition? And how will this leadership pivot shape its rivalry with BHP and others in the race for critical minerals? One thing’s for sure: the mining world is in for a wild ride. For now, Stausholm remains at the helm, ensuring a smooth transition as Rio Tinto hunts for its next visionary. Stay tuned—this story is far from over.",Reddit

519,Global,2025-01,"Tax surge puts shock third budget surplus within reach-Article: Economists say Labor has a realistic chance of posting a shock third budget surplus as soaring tax revenue delivers Treasurer Jim Chalmers a $14.5 billion windfall that could allow the government to promote its economic credentials or spend more cash during the election campaign. Booming income tax from a strong jobs market and a weak Australian dollar that is turbocharging company taxes on US dollar-priced commodity exports have halved the budget deficit, according to Department of Finance figures. The deficit in the five months to November 30 was $14 billion, versus an expected deficit of $28.5 billion to that point in the year. Treasurer Jim Chalmers on the pre-election campaign in Queensland this week. Nine News Budgets typically start the early months of the fiscal year in deficit and move towards surplus as more tax revenue flows through in later months approaching the June 30 financial year-end. Former Treasury economists say the full-year deficit is on track to be much smaller than the $26.9 billion deficit estimated in the December budget update, with a surplus a realistic possibility based on the current trajectory. The surprise turnaround will provide an opportunity for Dr Chalmers to trumpet Labor’s financial management as the party approaches an election due by May 17 and could give it more flexibility to spend on new promises to woo voters. Canberra-based Outlook Economics director Peter Downes said the budget was heading for another windfall and a surplus was within reach in 2024-25 if the current economic trends persisted for the next six months. Advertisement “If the unemployment rate has a 3 in front of it, the iron ore price is still around $US100 a tonne and the exchange rate is still around US62¢, then there will probably be a surplus,” Mr Downes told AFR Weekend. “That’s assuming they don’t go on an election spending binge, and the election promises will probably mainly be [after this financial year] for 2025-26 onwards.” The Coalition and some economists have criticised Labor’s rise in spending, such as a $26 billion blowout in aged care, disability, medicines and childcare costs compared with its maiden budget, as The Australian Financial Reviewreported this week. But the unprecedented revenue windfalls from an extra 1 million workers paying income taxes and high commodity export prices have been even larger than the additional outlays. Total budget revenue is cumulatively more than $380 billion higher over five years compared with Treasury’s forecasts on the eve of the May 2022 election, economist Chris Richardson calculates. Much of the election spending, such as the $7.2 billion pledged by the prime minister for the Bruce Highway in Queensland this week, will be for future years over the longer term and will not affect this year’s budget outcome. Asked about the prospect of a stronger budget this year and the possibility of a third surplus, Dr Chalmers said on Friday that responsible budget and economic management had been a hallmark of the Albanese government’s first term. ‘Lot of volatility’ “We delivered back-to-back surpluses in our first two years and almost halved the deficit we inherited in our third,” he said. “The budget position is already $200 billion better than at the last election, debt’s down $177 billion and that means we’re paying less interest on it in the years ahead. “There’s a lot of volatility in the global economy playing out here but we haven’t seen anything that would materially change the estimates from a month ago.” A much smaller deficit or third surplus would boost Labor’s fiscal credentials in an election campaign, although the final budget result won’t be known until after the election and the June 30 year-end. The Coalition leads Labor on a two-party-preferred basis by 51 per cent to 49 per cent, which would put Labor into minority government, according to The Australian Financial Review/Freshwater Strategy poll in December. The Coalition leads Labor as the best party to manage the economy. In the five months ended November 30, taxes drawn from companies, individuals, superannuation and goods and services were all higher than anticipated in the May budget. Personal income tax payments are running $7.6 billion higher due to the unemployment rate being a low 3.9 per cent, boosted by strong female participation in the care economy. A strong sharemarket has pushed up superannuation taxes by $1.8 billion and company tax collections are tracking $400 million higher. GST collections, which are passed on to the states and territories, are $1.6 billion higher than expected. Total expenses in the first five months of the financial year were $3 billion lower than forecast, largely due to lower grants to the states. Westpac economist Pat Bustamante said the fiscal result to the end of November showed luck continued to shine on the budget. “Stronger than expected labour income and company profits have seen tax collections track ahead of expectations,” he said. “Going forward, the falling Australian dollar will boost Aussie-denominated profits for exporters, providing some further upside.” Labour shortages Mr Bustamante also noted that some payments, such as grants and subsidies for infrastructure projects, were lower than expected, perhaps as a result of labour shortages pushing out project milestones. “Should these dynamics continue, a third consecutive surplus is a possibility but will depend on how the government manages its finances over the remainder of the fiscal year,” he said. Mr Downes and Mr Bustamante, both former Treasury forecasters, were two of the first private sector economists to tip the budget to shift from deep deficits during the pandemic to a surprise surplus in 2022-23. The $22.1 billion surplus delivered by Labor was the first since Liberals John Howard and Peter Costello were in power 15 years earlier. Dr Chalmers delivered a second surplus of $15.8 billion in 2023-24. Weak Aussie dollar boosts budget The Department of Finance figures to the end of November were published on its website the day before Christmas, but the marked improvement has not previously been reported. The government’s separate mid-year budget published a week earlier on December 18 appears to have been overly conservative on revenue forecasts in the near term compared with the actual revenue inflows so far. Treasury’s forecasts will be updated in a scheduled March 25 budget, if an election hasn’t already been called by then, or in the official Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook to be published within 10 days of the election being called. The slump in the Australian dollar, which dipped below US62¢ on Friday, boosts national income and government tax revenue. The local currency is about 3.5 per cent lower on a trade-weighted index (TWI) basis than forecast by Treasury. A 5 per cent lower TWI boosts the federal budget by about $11 billion in a year. Major commodity exports, including iron ore, coal and gas, are priced in US dollars, delivering higher Australian dollar returns to miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto, and higher corporate tax payments. The higher national income also flows through to higher prices and a bigger revenue base for income tax and GST.",Reddit

Picutre: NewsWire/ Gaye Gerard “The competition in the global smelting market is fierce and it’s not a level playing field with countries trying to take strategic positions in the market,” said Troy Wilson, the interim chief operating officer of Glencore’s local metals business. “It is our hope that conditions improve over the next three years to a point where government assistance is no longer necessary.” Naturally, as is the way of these handouts under Labor’s industrial adventure, and sub-par transition to cleaner energy, Ayres glammed it up as an “investment” in industrial capacity and to “protect” 600 jobs. “Copper is critical to building solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage systems,” Ayres said. “This investment strengthens our supply chains and supports Australia’s transition to net zero. If Australia didn’t already have established facilities like the Mount Isa copper smelter, we’d be looking to build them to protect Australia’s industrial capability, and strengthen the capability needed for (the) future.” We’re in a bleak era of [rampant protectionism](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/us-presidents-troubles-come-cheap-but-will-leave-expensive/news-story/f6ea836799e8cf686506f2acb5419692), where self-harm is the ardour of the day. It did not start on January 20 this year but, as in so many spheres of activity, Trump Unbound has been a force multiplier.

Understanding whether we are trying to reduce supply-chain risks, speed up the green transition or create jobs is needed to help evaluate whether the policies stack up.” Minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology. Picture: Glencore To ensure Labor’s industry policy had effective guardrails, Treasury developed a [National Interest Framework](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/labor-future-made-in-australia-tense-amid-bill-impasse/news-story/443198f54611b83032a0eb0185e62f2c), a set of hoops projects needed to go through before qualifying for public funding. There are two streams, one supporting net zero, the other economic resilience and security. Is there any evidence these guardrails are anything more than the flimsy high-vis plastic barriers councils erect around local works? Given Australia’s new world of trade and strategic threats, and inevitable policy tensions between financial prosperity and national security, former Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has spoken about adapting Australia’s successful model of economic and social progress. “But it also needs to maintain the conventional economic considerations of budget constraints, trade-offs and cost-benefit analysis,” Kennedy, now secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said in May. As former economic adviser to Barack Obama Jason Furman has argued, those wise conventions went missing in action under Joe Biden’s wayward administration in a “post-neoliberal delusion”.

Those that fought it are Anti-American, and representing other Copper competitive Countries,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. - Resolution Copper described the Monday ruling as ""merely a temporary pause,"" adding it was confident the court would ultimately affirm the necessary land transfer. - ""This proposed mine is a rip-off, will destroy a sacred area, decimates our environment, threatens our water rights, and is bad for America,"" Terry Rambler, chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, said in a Facebook post. - Addressing Trump's Truth Social post on the recent court ruling, Rambler said the U.S. president's comments ""mirror misinformation that has been repeated by foreign mining interests that want to extract American copper."" - He added that he was willing to meet with the Trump administration to help ""protect American interests."" - The Arizona copper project is a proposed underground mine roughly 60 miles east of Phoenix, close to the the town of Superior. The joint venture is 55% owned by Rio Tinto and 45% by BHP. - Resolution Copper says the ore deposit represents ""one of the most significant untapped copper deposits today"" and estimates the potential for the project to add $1 billion a year to Arizona's economy. - A highly conducive metal, copper is a critical component to virtually everything in the modern economy, from solar panels and wind turbines to defense applications and artificial intelligence infrastructure. - Demand for copper is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid the energy transition. - In a LinkedIn post, BHP CEO Mike Henry thanked Trump and Burgum for ""for their strong leadership to reinvigorate mining and processing supply chains in and for America."" - Alongside Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm and the company's incoming CEO Simon Trott, BHP's Henry said they met with Trump and Burgum to underscore the firm's commitment to develop Resolution Copper. - The U.S. produces only about 5% of the world's copper, according to Dutch bank ING and has seen a 20% decline in production over the last decade. Building new mines in the country, meanwhile, can take a considerable amount of time due to a lengthy permitting process. - Trump recently surprised markets by exempting refined metals from tariffs on copper products. The U.S. president initially touted copper tariffs of 50% as part of an effort to boost domestic production and reduce the country's reliance on imports. - In a pared-back announcement thereafter, however, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff on copper pipes and wiring from Aug. 1, leaving out copper ores, concentrates and cathodes. - More than half of global copper reserves are said to be located in just five countries — Chile, Australia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Russia.",Reddit

And the solution is staring us in the face-[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9064167/jenna-price-anu-in-crisis-the-overhaul-it-needs-now](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9064167/jenna-price-anu-in-crisis-the-overhaul-it-needs-now) By Jenna Price September 11 2025 - 4:35pm How is it that one of our most beloved institutions, the Australian National University, is so poorly run? How is it that we discover, a minute into the new vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell’s tenure that hundreds of staff would need to be sacked? Courses cancelled. Research abandoned. Let me tell you how. The governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone. The governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction. The good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act. Bell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent. Between the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal? The speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere. She’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted. But as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell. There are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university. This is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility. And a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person. That may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster. The problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells. “There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy. She is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project. Hendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out. Hendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \[The university’s own change management process\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.” The ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift. “We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says. Right now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers. One of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says. “She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz. “We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.” Can Bishop oversee meaningful change? Now that’s a story for a few months down the track. *Jenna Price is a Canberra Times columnist and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University.*",Reddit

571,Global,2025-09,"Western Australia: Potential for uranium ban removal in 2026-Obligatory G'day uranium fiends. We all know sentiment to nuclear and uranium has been shifting slowly, but bans on uranium mining still exist in some jurisdictions. Sweden looks set to bet the first mover in this space, and I believe Western Australia (WA) will be next to make this change in late 2026. **Political Situation** For the non-Aussies, Australia's political system is basically a two-party system, dominated currently by: * ALP: Australian Labour Party (left leaning) * LNP: A coalition of The Liberal Party and The National Party (right leaning) At a federal level the ALP are the incumbent government, having fought off the pro-nuclear LNP at the recent federal election in 2025. There was also a state election in Western Australia in early 2025 where the incumbent state ALP retained power from the pro uranium-mining LNP. At face value, this seems like there's no chance of the uranium mining ban in WA being lifted, right? ALP in power, anti-nuclear, anti-uranium. What hope is there? Australia currently has 3 operating uranium mines, all located in South Australia: * Olympic Dam (BHP \~8Mlb/yr) * Four Mile (Heathgate \~4.7Mlb/yr) * Honeymoon (Boss Energy \~1.6Mlb/yr). The current state government in South Australia is ALP and their leader has made numerous positive comments about nuclear, uranium mining and AUKUS (deal with UK and US to build nuclear submarines in Australia). This is not a party stance, it is driven by certain people within the ALP. Even former ALP Prime Minister Bob Hawke has been vocally pro nuclear. In Australia, mining is a state controlled issue. State political terms are 4 years. The next Western Australian election will be in 2029, more on the relevance of this later. **What about federal interference?** The federal environmental minister can pull rank, and recently did cancelling a [gold mine](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/mining-lobby-says-plibersek-intervention-imperils-1b-gold-project-20240818-p5k3ca) because it had Traditional Owner opposition. So are the ALP just left leaning crackpots that will interfere with all mining? Absolutely not! Four coal mines were recently approved and so was a massive gas extension that would take the project out well past their goal of being net zero by 2050. Mining is the backbone of the Australian economy, the 5 largest exports, all minerals, account for 62.6% of all exports in 2024. **Traditional Owner Risk?** For those unfamiliar with Australia's past, and this is probably news to even some Aussies, there are \~250 different 'national' Indigenous Australians groups. They do not all think and act the same, there are distinct languages and even dialects within regions, between regions they disagree on many issues. Whilst some will fight all mining, others will happily work with mining for the job opportunities in the community (and the royalties...). Build positive relationships and this is no different to Canadian or US miners working with traditional owners over there. Something that needs to be considered, but not impossible. **History of Uranium Mining in Western Australia** 2002, the Western Australian Labor Government banned uranium mining in the State due to environmental and safety concerns, community fear and questions over its economic viability. However, exploration was allowed to continue. Six years later, the ban on uranium mining was overturned by Western Australia’s newly elected Liberal Government in 2008. This decision also followed the Federal Government’s decision to abandon the ‘no new mines’ policy. Following the lifting of the ban, four projects were approved in WA: Wiluna (Toro Energy), Kintyre (Cameco), Mulga Rock (Vimy/Deep Yellow) and Yeelirrie (Cameco). In 2017, Labor returned to Government, and in fulfilment of an election promise, implemented a “no uranium” condition on future mining leases, but allowed the four approved projects to proceed if they met certain conditions within five years. This included demonstrating “substantial commencement” of their plans on site. In 2022, only one of the four projects, [Mulga Rock](https://deepyellow.com.au/projects/australia/mulga-rock-project/approvals-and-compliance/) (Vimy at the time, acquired by Deep Yellow), received notice that “substantial commencement” had been achieved and was able to proceed. Mulga Rock is currently undertaking a revised Definitive Feasibility Study (due Q3 2026) to optimise project parameters by including critical mineral recovery optimisation work, detailed resource definition drilling and mining studies. The other 3 projects either failed to meet the deadline or requested an extension. NOTE: this is not a legislated ban, it is a policy of the incumbent government not to issue a mining license to a uranium project. This is a VERY easy change. **Western Australian Economy** In Western Australia everyone either works in the mining industry, work in an adjacent industry that supplies something to the mining industry, directly benefits from people with mining industry money spending their rock cash, is related to someone in the mining industry or is having sex with someone in the mining industry. TLDR: 52% of Western Australia's exports are from iron ore alone.

To top this off Rio Tinto is about to start up the Simandu iron ore mine in Papua New Guinea, dubbed ""[the Pilbara killer](https://www.mining.com/aussie-dollar-climbing-is-the-iron-ore-trade-back-on/)"" (Pilbara is the region in Western Australia known for mining/iron ore). **Western Australia Uranium** Globally, Australia has the largest amount of uranium resources, with approximately 1,684,100 tonnes (shit loads of this is in the 2,000Mlb beast Olympic Dam). Western Australia alone has known deposits of about 226,000 tonnes, which would place it as the eighth largest uranium resource in the world. **Social and Political Change is Happening** The [Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA](https://cciwa.com/policy-submission/uranium-mining-in-western-australia/) has been very vocal about Western Australia overturning the uranium mining ban\*\*.\*\* Nuclear and by association uranium is about to become a lot more socially normalised in Western Australia with the US Navy already advertising (possibly posting?) nuclear engineers in Western Australia for the new [Henderson Defence Precinct](https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/media-releases/2025-09-14/additional-defence-funding-deliver-henderson-defence-precinct) as part of AUKUS A recent [poll](https://world-nuclear-news.org/articles/western-australians-support-lifting-uranium-ban-poll-finds) (smallish, biased organiser) found 57% of respondents supported uranium mining in Western Australia. **The Kicker** Western Australia is going to get a uranium mine, even with the current policy not to issue 'new' mining licenses. As previously noted Mulga Rock achieved 'substantial commencement' by digging a hole for early site works, this was enough to get the go ahead before the deadline. However, Deep Yellow acquired Vimy Resources and Mr Uranium (John Borshoff) saw an opportunity to further develop Mulga Rock. Deep Yellow have completed additional resource expansion increasing the Mulga Rock East deposit from 56.7Mlb to 71.2Mlb, with 39.6Mlb of that in proven and probable reserves. There is an additional 33.6Mlb at Mulga Rock West. In addition to the resource expansion they have turned this project into a polymetallic mine and are currently doing pilot test work on a beneficiation process which has shown early test capacity to upgraded the ore feed from 662ppm to 1698ppm. The revised DFS was originally planned for Q4 2025, however has been pushed out to Q3 2026. Deep Yellow are currently sitting on their hands delaying FID for their Tumas project in Namibia due to the current uranium price, so capital to develop both projects in close timelines may be a challenge to raise. **The Opportunity** The WA premier, Roger Cook, recently requested an [Inquiry into the role of Western Australia in the global effort on decarbonisation](https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Parliament/commit.nsf/(EvidenceOnly)/2AB1C5D5620D2C0348258CED000FC147?opendocument#ToR) The Committee is to consider and make recommendations on: 1. The pathways our **major trading partners** have to decarbonising and the potential for Western Australia to contribute through: a) LNG exports, to provide energy security as they exit coal and transition to renewable energy. b) Blue and **green fuels**, such as hydrogen and ammonia. c) Green iron. d) The importance of carbon capture and storage to the above. I have it on good authority that uranium will be accepted, as per the recent shifts globally in definition, as a green fuel for the purposes of this inquiry. To reinforce this, today a [news article](https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/wa-premier-s-trade-mission-to-talk-green-steel-lng-and-uranium-20250918-p5mwak.html) came out with: On the eve of an energy-focused trade mission to China and Japan, Premier Roger Cook has softened his language on the WA government’s uranium mining ban, saying it is “watching this space”.

572,Global,2025-06,"Human recommendations for Mobius/Bilal/Druillet esque reads? Can reddit beat the algorithm?-I have gone down a massive graphic novel rabbit hole over the last few months - my credit card does not thank me - and I've been working through recommendations made by a few great posts here on reddit. Because ChatGPT managed to complete the exam that I set my students in &lt;60s, I thought I'd see how good it is at recommending me some graphic novels. After all, the algorithms just CAN'T do this, surely? Right? Well, it seems to me to have done a decent job - what do you reckon? Here's what I wanted: I'm a big fan of the art in Metal Hurlant (Mobius, Bilal, and especially Druillet). I also love modern artists like Templesmith and SIENKIEWICZ). Can you give me a top 10 of comics/graphic novels that I should read? (the below is after I asked it to assume that I have read everything by the listed authors, that it needed to be in print, and not from big-two publishers: **1. The Metabarons** – Alejandro Jodorowsky &amp; Juan Giménez. The ultimate Heavy-Metal dynastic opera; chrome-etched space cathedrals for 500 pages. **2. Valerian &amp; Laureline: The Complete Collection v.1** – Pierre Christin &amp; Jean-Claude Mézières - Breezy, humanist space-opera that pre-figured *Star Wars* set design. **3. Saga** – Brian K. Vaughan &amp; Fiona Staples - Profane Romeo-and-Juliet-in-space; lush digital inks echo Moebius’s colour sense. **4. Descender** – Jeff Lemire &amp; Dustin Nguyen - Water-colour galactic SF that slips from pastoral to cosmic horror. **5. Ascender** – Lemire &amp; Nguyen - Magic-fantasy sequel that flips Descender’s palette into jewel-tones. **6. Black Science** – Rick Remender &amp; Matteo Scalera - Dimension-hopping pulp painted in psychedelia-on-speed colours. **7. East of West** – Jonathan Hickman &amp; Nick Dragotta - Apocalyptic diesel-western with wild Moebius-meets-Leone vistas. **8. Head Lopper** – Andrew MacLean - Sword-and-severed-head fun drawn with Heavy-Metal swagger **9. Prophet: Remission** – Brandon Graham, Simon Roy et al. - A love-letter to Druillet-scale bio-planets and Moebius line work. **10. Monstress** – Marjorie Liu &amp; Sana Takeda - Art-deco kaiju fantasy with sumi-ink filigree and monstrous body-horror. **11. Invisible Kingdom** – G. Willow Wilson &amp; Christian Ward - Eisner-winning Day-Glo water-colour space-opera about faith vs commerce. **12. Coffin Bound** – Dan Watters &amp; Dani - Grind-house existential road trip; scratchy inks &amp; neon dust. **13.

The Obscure Cities: The Great Walls of Samaris** – Benoît Peeters &amp; François Schuiten - Kafka-meets-Art-Nouveau urban fantasy; meticulous architectural draftsmanship.

Understanding whether we are trying to reduce supply-chain risks, speed up the green transition or create jobs is needed to help evaluate whether the policies stack up.” Minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology.

There are two streams, one supporting net zero, the other economic resilience and security. Is there any evidence these guardrails are anything more than the flimsy high-vis plastic barriers councils erect around local works? Given Australia’s new world of trade and strategic threats, and inevitable policy tensions between financial prosperity and national security, former Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has spoken about adapting Australia’s successful model of economic and social progress. “But it also needs to maintain the conventional economic considerations of budget constraints, trade-offs and cost-benefit analysis,” Kennedy, now secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said in May.

Hello, So Ive been lucky to get multiple job offers I can take as a recent university graduate, I did a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. So the offers I received for the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms everyone knows and puts on a pedestal as well as the mining engineering Fly in fly out offer. Second path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical/mining engineering roles offered. I’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pay for mechanical/traditional engineers at the same top company FAANG was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path. Thanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role But I’m just really curious to why this is the case even matching at a top company so it’s a bit more even the software/tech engineers get paid more than the traditional/mechanical engineers like even from levels fyi and from my own experiences and offers and friends/acquaintances have told. Even my dad is a team lead in mining engineering as a mining engineer yet my Software Engineering offer at FAANG pays more than that which is crazy.

580,Global,2025-09,"How to Get a Job as a Geologist in Australia-Hey legends! I’m an Australian geologist currently working in the exploration sector, and I often see questions from international geos about how to break into the geology scene. So I thought I’d share a simple step-by-step guide based on what I’ve seen works for others, especially around job hunting and visa options. It's not an exhaustive summary, but it should help people find answers to some of the basic questions which get asked on here a lot. Whether you're into mineral exploration, environmental geology, or mining, Australia has a thriving geoscience industry. Here's how to get your foot in the door, without buying some bullshit FIFO guide from some Irish mug on TikTok. # Step 1: Understand the Job Landscape Geology jobs in Australia are concentrated in every state, here is a general breakdown: * **Western Australia** – gold, iron ore, lithium, nickel. Everything. Literally God's country * **Queensland** – coal, copper, gold. Not bad, but not WA * **South Australia** – uranium, copper, gold, other shit * **Victoria &amp; NSW** – environmental and engineering geology. Gold and Copper. Dogshit state * **Northern Territory** \- gold, uranium, copper. Not a bad place to work Best places to find jobs: * [Seek.com.au](http://Seek.com.au) * LinkedIn * Company career pages (BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Evolution Mining etc) * Your network # Step 2: Qualifications &amp; Skills Most roles require: * A Bachelor’s degree in Geology * Honours, Masters and PhD's aren't required. * Field experience (internships or prior roles) * Experience counts for a lot * Software skills (ArcGIS, Leapfrog, Micromine, Qgis etc.) * Nice to have * Good attitude. Be a good cunt * Imperative If you studied overseas, you may need a skills assessment through VETASSESS or Engineers Australia to validate your qualifications. Unfortunately not all universities are the same. If you graduated from a first world institution, you should be fine. If you graduated from the University of Improvised Solutions and Creative Excuses (UISCE) your degree probably wont be recognized. # Step 3: Visa Pathways for International Geologists Australia offers several visa options for geologists. I am not a Visa agent, so it is worthwhile paying the money to speak to someone to get some accurate advice. # Skilled Migration (Points-Based) * Subclass 189 (Skilled Independent) or Subclass 190 (State Sponsored) * Geologist is on the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL), which is good. * You’ll need: * Skills assessment * English test (IELTS or PTE) * Expression of Interest (EOI) via SkillSelect * Enough points (based on age, experience, education, etc.) # Employer Sponsored Visas * Subclass 482 (Temporary Skill Shortage) or Subclass 186 (Employer Nomination Scheme) * Requires a job offer from an approved sponsor, common in mining and exploration companies # Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 417 or 462) * If you're aged 18–30 (or 35 for some countries), this is a great way to enter Australia and work casually or short-term * Many geology grads use this to get field assistant roles or short contracts, then transition to skilled visas later * You can stay up to 12 months (extendable), and it’s a great way to build local experience If you're hoping to get sponsored whilst you are in the UK, Canada or the USA. Goodluck. You have a 0.001% chance of that happening, unless you are a fucking geology gun. As a grad, get a WHV and come here that way. # Step 4: Apply &amp; Network Tailor your resume to Aussie standards and highlight: * Fieldwork experience * Safety certifications (e.g., First Aid, operate and maintain a 4x4 vehicle) * Willingness to work in remote areas or FIFO (Fly-In Fly-Out) Join professional bodies like: * AusIMM (Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy) * Geological Society of Australia * Australian Institute of Geoscientists(AIG) Attend webinars, conferences, and local meetups. Networking goes a long way here. See my point about being a good cunt again for further reference. # Final Tips * Be open to contract roles, they often lead to permanent gigs * Get your documents sorted early (passport, transcripts, references) * Make it easy to get hired. If you make it difficult your application will go in the bin * Consider short courses in Australian geology or mining safety * Get a tax file number, super account, bank account organized as soon as you land in Australia. That way you are all set up to get on boarded, and paid. * Use Telstra for your phone. Avoid Vodaphone and Optus. You wont have reception onsite, or in remote areas. * The housing situation here is a bit fucked at the moment. Expect to struggle to find accommodation, or pay a lot. Try and find a share house or hostel before you arrive.",Reddit
581,Global,2025-10,"🚨 Gunnison Copper (GCUMF) — America’s Next Copper Boom? 🚨-Gunnison Copper is a severely undervalued pure-play copper developer with production starting in 2025, backed by Rio Tinto, and aligned with U.S. national strategy to secure domestic copper supply. This could be a multi-bagger for early investors. 🔎 Why I’m Buying Gunnison Copper (GCUMF) - Production starts Q3 2025 at Johnson Camp Mine (JCM), with up to 25M lbs/year of copper cathode. No waiting 5–10 years like other juniors. - NPV of $1.3B and IRR of 20.9% from the Gunnison Project. Payback in 4.1 years. That’s insane for a sub-$50M market cap. - Backed by Nuton LLC (Rio Tinto) — they’re funding and providing tech for Stage 2 development. This isn’t a solo junior struggling for cash. - $13.9M in transferable 48C tax credits from the U.S. government. Gunnison is the only copper project to receive this. - University of Arizona study projects $14.6B in total output and 53,000 job-years created. This is a generational asset. - SX/EW technology means they produce finished copper cathode on-site — no smelter dependency, no overseas shipping. - Arizona location = low geopolitical risk, direct rail access, and full alignment with U.S. push for domestic resource independence. 🧠 Macro Tailwinds - Copper is a critical mineral for EVs, renewables, and defense. U.S. wants to stop relying on imports. - Global copper supply is tightening. Prices are expected to surge as demand outpaces new production. - Gunnison is one of the few projects that can deliver Made-in-America copper in the next 12–18 months. 📊 Visuals That Speak for Themselves - 🔗 https://www.gunnisoncopper.com/projects/project-overview — maps, infrastructure, and SX/EW flow - 🔗 https://gunnisoncopper.com/news/news-2025/gunnison-copper-reports-preliminary-results-of-university-of2025-10-08-033502 — $14.6B output, 53,000 job-years - 🔗 https://www.gunnisoncopper.com/news/news-2025/gunnison-copper-provides-a-construction-update-for-the-johns2025-03-21-040503 — production timeline and mobilization - 🔗 https://veryindependentresearch.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-14-Gunnison-Cu-Corp-Very-Independent-Research-Presentation.pdf — deep dive on valuation and upside 🧨 My Take This is one of the few penny stocks with real assets, real production, and real backing.

582,Global,2024-07,"fifo jobs Australia.-Honest question, why is everyone here so negative about getting a job in the mines? Bit of context I’ve been working FIFO for the past 8 years (im Australian). I’ve been drilling for ausdrill, Rio Tinto, MRL, FMG. I’ve been lucky enough to work on a few different sites and meet some amazing people. 1. The amount of backpackers working in the mines on a working holiday visa is actually insane. True most of them work on shutdowns and won’t get a full time job with any of the big boys. BUT doesn’t mean they won’t get jobs in mining. You really want a job? Go move to Kalgoorlie and you WILL get a job. Hell I moved to Kalgoorlie to get my first mining job. Though most of you definitely wouldn’t last a week offsiding. 2. As for TikTok videos. I mean tbh some of them are pretty accurate 😂 All of you that call bullshit have either never worked in the mines or are doing mining completely wrong 😅😂 IF only you knew what blast hole drillers do in a day 😂😂😂😂. 3. As for pay, no you won’t be earning 200k+ a year as an entry level. Heck I’m only just cracking that as an experienced driller. Realistically you would be making 110k-120k a year as an entry level offsider. 4. Lastly all I want to say is, don’t let some dumbass that couldn’t get into the mines tell you, you can’t. I’ve had offsiders from holland and France get sponsored and become drillers. The amount of backpackers working for shut down crews and catering companies are insane. Be realistic, you won’t get jobs working for the big companies. Non the less allot of the labour higher agency’s will higher you. Get all ur tickets, grow some balls and move to a mining town. If you can’t get a job, something is wrong with you.",Reddit
583,Global,2021-09,"RIO is a company in trouble that has forgotten their ways, I think they need a reminder of who they were.-Alright cunts, a lot of you are finally paying attention to the fact that the Chinese housing market is effectively a Ponzi scheme. One knock off effect of this is that the big three Iron producers in Australia, FMG BHP RIO, have had considerable decreases in share price. BHP has fallen 32.90% from its high this year for a $66b USD decrease in value RIO has fallen 29.62% from its high this year for a $47b USD decrease in value FMG has fallen 44.06% from its high this year for a $26b USD decrease in value Collectively, the big three of this industry have **lost ~$140b USD in value** from the peak this year. Now could this massive burst really all stem from the greatest housing bubble in the history of the world? At a first glance, it may appear plausible, but I would like to offer a different explanation. In early May 2020, RIO was sitting at a measly $45.01 per share at a market cap of $67b USD. The leadership realized something needed to be done. By the end of May, the news broke that [RIO destroyed a system of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/mining-firm-rio-tinto-sorry-for-destroying-aboriginal-caves/). When asked for an explanation, CEO Chris Salisbury exclaimed that he was [""sorry for the distress we have caused""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4), and that ""We **pay our respects** to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP)."" The result? Within a year RIO shares skyrocket more than 100% to the $95.97 high, adding roughly $90b value to shareholders. Now when you consider that only $135m in iron ore was expected to be extracted following this operation, we can assign the majority of the added value to the Sigma chad energy gained by destroying one of the oldest cultural heritage sites on the planet. You might beg to differ, claiming something stupid about changing iron ore prices, but I think the results are obvious. You're probably just one of the 60% of beta cuck shareholders that voted down executive bonus pay for the company following such an outstandingly successful mission. The free market has decided that the destruction of cultural heritage sites is a vital factor in determining value for a mining company. RIO needs to get their groove back. I spent some time researching various sites that RIO had feasible access to, but then a bolt of inspiration hit me. In the grand scheme of cultural significance, these caves really were a small player. There is no reason for the company to restrain itself to minor targets when a grand statement could set their legacy forever. There are many Australian super funds hanging in the balance here. We need a destructive event to shake the world. [From the Australian Government Tourist Industry database](https://www.tra.gov.au/Regional/local-government-area-profiles), approximately 1.9 million people visited the Northern Territory in the pre-covid year period 2018/19. These tourists spent nearly $2.5b. Of these tourists, ~250,000 went to Alice Springs to visit our great cultural wonder, Uluru. Therefore if we decide Uluru is a company, it has a yearly revenue of 2.5\*(0.25/1.9) = $330m. Taking the P/R of one of our most respected, effectively valued companies, Afterpay, ($37.5b MC at $836m revenue =&gt; 88 P/R ratio), this values Uluru at 0.33\*88 = $29 Billion. Now we need to factor in the Effective Cultural Value Leverage (ECVL) to get a true valuation as to what destroying Uluru would gain for RIO. If destroying a series of caves for $135m in iron ore created $90b in value, this means the average ECVL (n=1) is 90/0.135 = 666 (3 s.f). With our holy number, the ECVL valuation of destroying Uluru is 29\***666** = 19.3 Trillion Dollars. This would make RIO nearly 10x larger than the greatest American companies, and put the ASX on the map as one of the largest markets in the world. It is time to ""pay our respects"". Now that we have a calculated plan to rescue the Australian economy, we need an appropriate method of execution. Obliterating Uluru out of existence will not be a simple task. [According to a 2018 Geological survey](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/discover/highlights/amazing-facts/), Uluru is an estimated 1.425 billion tons of solid rock above the ground. To be sure and completely destroy the foundations of a global icon, we should be prepared to move 5 billion tons. The regular TNT demolitions will not work for a job this big. We're gonna need a bigger bomb ☢️☢️☢️. [The Sedan crater is a 390mx100m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_Crater) hole in the Nevada desert created by a 104KT thermonuclear explosion. In this explosion, an estimated 11 million tons of earth was shifted. Again by analogy, the most accurate of scientific methods, we could expect to destroy ~1 million tons of rock for every 1 KT of TNT in our explosion. Therefore, we need an atomic device capable of delivering a payload of 50,000 KT. Luckily for us, such a device has been created and successfully tested. Designed by the glorious Soviet Union in 1961, the [Tsar Bomba (""Mother of all Bombs"")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba) is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a Hydrogen bomb with a measured yield of 50,000 KT. A perfect match for our requirements. To conclude, the Science has made the correct course of action obvious. Destroying aboriginal cultural heritage sites is what RIO does best, and should be remembered for all time. The above described course of action should be embraced to create stakeholder wealth. There are obvious Environmental, Social, and Governance benefits in this decision. Therefore, it is with utmost haste that I shall urge the executive leadership of the second largest Iron producer in Australia to commission the Russian Government to once again create the greatest weapon of mass destruction the world has ever seen. The economy needs a sacrifice. Edit: Thanks for the mod who gave this the correct flair, had it incorrectly flaired as Dumbfuck Discussion before. Edit2: Added USD for currencies for clarity, had BHP RIO values in USD but FMG in AUD, fucking google finance. Fixed it now. The $135m value for the cave project is in AUD, and should be converted to USD, but this simply means that the ECVL should be higher than what I have calculated. Leaving as is because 666 is a good meme, and we should always strive to be conservative with estimates.",Reddit

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually. **The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China**. Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865. The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels. Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" in a speech this week at the United Nations. ""If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders Tuesday. The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability. A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month. Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV. Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales. Besides batteries for cars, cellphones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

After nearly a decade of research and development in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of Minnesota, Niron Magnetics said it has successfully created one of the first commercially viable new magnet materials in decades, capable of producing superior permanent magnets. Niron Magnetics said its product does not contain any rare-earth elements, and is made from abundant elements such as iron and nitrogen. The company said it is able to scale manufacturing of permanent magnets made from iron nitride, which exhibits exceptionally high magnetization and removes the need for rare-earth elements. Investors and commercial partners include Stellantis, Samsung, Allison Transmission, Magna, and others already sampling products from the pilot facility, it said. The new 190,000-square-foot facility will expand Niron Magnetics’ capacity to supply rare-earth-free permanent magnets for data center cooling pumps, automobile motors, robotics, consumer electronics, defense and drone equipment, and other applications critical to the U.S. Economy, it said. The facility will be built on the former Verso Paper Mill site, redeveloping a US designated coal community property. The development comes at a critical time, as pressure on rare-earth supply chains intensifies due to geopolitical tensions and rising demand for permanent magnets globally. “We’re proud to scale this homegrown technology in the heart of the industrial Midwest, and excited to make this community central to America’s supply chain independence,” Niron CEO Jonathan Rowntree said in a news release. The plant will be operational in early 2027 and will create over 175 full-time jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and operations, the company said. “Permanent magnets are an essential part of modern vehicles, the heart of the performance for everything from powertrains and cooling systems to seat motors and speakers. We are committed to offering the freedom of choice to our customers and the integration of these magnets is critical to that mission,” Stellantis VP, Propulsion Systems Engineering, Sinisa Jurkovic said. “We’ve been working with Niron since 2023to unlock next-generation motor performance, and Iron Nitride technology is helping us engineer and deliver vehicles with best-in-class capabilities.” # FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS ABOVE: ***Food for thought:*** # Opinion of Titanium’s historic adoption curve vs. Scandium &amp; ScAl alloy projected trajectory. https://preview.redd.it/y9ek0dc87wrf1.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28aac04dcba8be1b71a957347324070061403b2 # 🔑 Core Similarities * **Both metals too expensive and scarce without government backing!** * Both needed **DoD adoption first** (SR-71 then → Gen VI now). * Both required **price support + stockpiling** to establish floor pricing. * Both needed **pilot → demo → full-scale production** facilities (Titanium sponge plants then → Sc-Al billet/plate facilities now). * **Both transformed into strategic materials underpinning aerospace and defense supply chains.** # 🎯 Why This Matters for NioCorp * Titanium’s U.S. adoption **couldn’t have happened without federal intervention** — same might be true for scandium. * NioCorp provides the Premiere upstream feedstock; For billet &amp; Plate capacities alongside allied &amp; other domestic sources allowing (Diversity of Supply). * Once the government **establishes the floor &amp; funds facilities**, Scandium can follow Titanium’s curve: defense → aerospace → mainstream industry. **IMHO- The U.S. Scandium story is unfolding almost exactly the way titanium did in the 1950s**. Titanium only moved from “exotic metal” to cornerstone aerospace material because the U.S. government stepped in with price supports, military demand guarantees, and direct funding for production facilities. That intervention created the base load of demand that allowed companies like Boeing and the broader commercial sector to adopt titanium decades later. The Pentagon essentially built the titanium industry from scratch — and today, we might be watching the same blueprint emerge for scandium. **NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is the keystone.** With scandium oxide pricing now anchored by the Pentagon’s $40M Rio Tinto contract, and with federal lenders like EXIM and DFC lining up, the U.S. is signaling that scandium alloys are too strategic to leave to chance. NioCorp cannot carry this alone — but just as titanium required major government intervention, scandium requires the same. That’s why we’re now seeing capital raises, defense-prime partnership rumors, and active discussions about government stakes in key Critical minerals projects. **Mark Smith’s vision of making the U.S. the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” is not just a soundbite — it’s been the playbook!** Elk Creek can provide the raw material, but government-backed funding for billet, plate, and alloy facilities will be what unlocks true adoption. The dots are connecting: federal price floors (See Rio Tinto $40M contract.), mine financing (In play EXIM &amp; others), manufacturing hubs (T.B.D.), and defense procurement (Working with DoD Defense Primes per Mark Smith Sept. 8th, 2025) are converging.

By Ronald Mizen 5 min. readView original Two former Productivity Commission bosses say there is a significant risk federal and state governments are held to ransom by uneconomic energy-intensive manufacturers who goad them into expensive taxpayer bailouts. Peter Harris and Michael Brennan have urged Treasurer Jim Chalmers to use his economic reform agenda to develop a clear strategy for deciding if taxpayer support for under-pressure businesses is the right move over the long term to avoid throwing good money after bad. A clean energy transformation of Tomago aluminium smelter in NSW faces a sliding doors moment in 2025.

The crisis underlines the financial struggles faced by manufacturers of aluminium, nickel, copper and other metals amid significant declines in treatment and refining revenues, as well as rising energy costs. Brennan, who led the Productivity Commission from 2018 to 2023 and now heads think tank the e61 Institute, said it was sometimes difficult amid the chaos of a threatened closure and loss of jobs to discern whether something was a good deal and good value for money. Michael Brennan: “There’s a risk you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies.” Sydney Morning Herald “There’s always a significant risk governments get held ransom and you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies,” he said. Harris, who chaired the commission between 2013 and 2018, said there was a danger of adding “band-aid upon a band-aid”. “We’re clearly in danger of not recalling the lessons we’ve learned because we think this is new and mega because Trump’s made it a bigger thing,” he said of the focus on propping up domestic manufacturing under the banner of “resilience”. # Reform agenda Resilience, boosting productivity and making the federal budget more sustainable are the three themes of Chalmers’ economic roundtable in Canberra next month, which the treasurer hopes will spark a major reform agenda. Peter Harris: “We should be working out what is sustainable here.” Australian Financial Review Both Harris and Brennan said there were circumstances where it might be appropriate to support a business, such as helping it get through a period of unsustainable energy prices or investing in productivity-improving plant. But there needed to be a clear framework that meant requests were not being dealt with on an ad-hoc basis and provided benefits to taxpayers, rather than just doling out operational cash. “Things like sovereign capability and resilience can be difficult things to pin down. That’s not to say they’re not important, but what matters is you have a systematic framework by which you think through these things so you’re not hostage to sort of piecemeal, case-by-case crisis decisions,” Brennan said. “What does the taxpayer get in return?” Harris indicated that politicians often make decisions to solve an immediate political problem without considering more fundamental issues. “The biggest problem with these things is there needs to be some kind of assessment asking: is it genuinely sustainable if we do what they’re asking us to do, or is it sub-scale and unlikely to be sustainable?” he said. “Now is the time to turn the Industry Department’s heads away from ‘when opportunity knocks, let’s get some dough,’ to doing the analysis. We should be working out what is sustainable here.” That meant assessing domestic and international markets to decide whether manufacturers would be viable again or keep needing bailouts. He said it may be appropriate to continue propping up companies supplying the local market for sovereign capability reasons. # ‘Truly insane’ “You can make the domestic argument, but you certainly can’t make the export argument ... The idea of paying to export something is truly, truly insane. You’ve determined to subsidise foreigners,” Harris said. Howell said Nyrstar needed assistance to weather “several hundred million” in losses expected over the next two years while the company considers whether it can upgrade the plants to process the critical minerals. Hundreds of millions of dollars are also required for the rebuild of the Port Pirie smelter in SA, while a $400 million upgrade is needed at the Nyrstar smelter near Hobart. That plant had already secured $70 million of funding from the federal and Tasmanian governments, but work on that project was put on hold by the company late last year due to rising costs. The $50 million from the federal government was promised by both Labor and the Coalition during the 2022 election campaign.[ The *Financial Review* has previously revealed](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz) the responsible department has no record of being asked for the money by the recipient or anyone. The funds were also promised without a business case, analysis of the value proposition of the project, and no probity advice. While [Nyrstar has struggled to make a decent return](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/trafigura-wipes-266m-off-its-australian-smelters-20221209-p5c53d), Trafigura in 2022 and 2023 booked profits worth more than $US14 billion ($20 billion), with each year setting a fresh record. The Tomago aluminium smelter is the nation’s largest electricity user and discussions about its bailout package are focused on the smelter’s electricity contract for 2026 to 2029 and the design of federal Labor’s production tax credits. “They’re running around in Sydney and Canberra looking for a lot of money,” a source previously told the *Financial Review*. “It’s billions, not hundreds of millions. It’s eye-watering.” Tomago is 51.6 per cent owned by mining giant Rio Tinto and uses about 10 per cent of NSW’s power supply running around the clock. It employs about 1000 people directly and claims to create as many as 5000 indirect jobs. The facility, which is also part-owned by CSR and Hydro Aluminium, is the country’s biggest aluminium producer, generating about 590,000 tonnes a year or around 37 per cent of Australia’s primary aluminium.",Reddit
588,Global,2025-08,"New to this- need help-hi y’all I’d appreciate any help and advice for more experienced knowledgeable people. I invested in Fannie Mae, PLTR, HOOD, OKLO, and CCJ. I started with 940k in August of 2024. Completely life changing. During this time I’ve lost my job in the film industry. Phased out by a number of forces, strikes, fires, and AI. I’m wondering how much I can make in Dividends. I’ve watch Rio Tinto for a long time. It’s just that the 6-8% game is always a loser to me. I make much much much more than that. I understand dividend are “safer” but I’m not so sure. Inflation and taxes eat up a bunch. I don’t have so much hubris to think I can keep doing what I have been doing. I’ve been aiming for 5 million but losing any of this money would not be worth it. Also I imagine that people move to dividend stocks when market crashes so they rise? Is that true? I. That case I would have capital to buy real estate or depreciated stocks when the crash hits and would be getting paid to wait for it (I like this idea right around now. Based on the crippling amount of dept we are due for a major debt crisis. Not just federal, but corporate and especially municipal (those municipal bond holders that go on and on about not paying taxes they’re gonna get burnt.) If anyone has ideas opinions about my situation I would be grateful.",Reddit

590,Global,2025-09,"Colorado School Of Mines: Mineral &amp; Energy Economics-Hey! Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on similR subreddits to this. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear) I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours) Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere. Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc. Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas jumped 31% to $7.48 in premarket tradingst, 2025\~World Takes First Steps in Breaking China’s Stranglehold on Rare Earth Magnets Supply While the total deal value was not disclosed, Lithium Americas confirmed it has finalized an agreement with the DOE to initiate the first $435 million draw from a previously announced $2.26 billion loan to support development of the Thacker Pass site. It will be the latest private sector investment by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration after recent stakes in Intel and MP Materials, seeking to boost industries seen as vital to U.S. national security. Last week, Reuters reported that administration officials were in discussions with Lithium Americas about an equity stake as they renegotiated terms of a $2.26 billion government loan for the Nevada-based mine, which is slated to become the largest source of battery metal lithium in the Western Hemisphere. Representatives for GM were not immediately available to comment. GM, which invested $625 million in the mine last year for a 38% stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years. Administration officials had initially sought a guarantee that GM would buy the metal regardless of market conditions, a request the automaker pushed back on and which led to the equity stake request, Reuters previously reported. The Thacker Pass project has long been touted by both Republicans and Democrats as a key way to boost U.S. critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world's largest lithium processor. China plays a dominant role in the global lithium supply chain, producing more than 40,000 metric tons each year, making it the third-largest producer after Australia and Chile. China's influence is far greater in refining, where it processes over 75% of the world's lithium into battery-grade material. The U.S. produces less than 5,000 metric tons of lithium at a Nevada facility owned by Albemarle. Thacker Pass's first phase is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year, enough for up to 800,000 EVs.

This is primarily due to rare earths’ increasing importance in electronics, defense, vehicles, and much more. For years, countries have been seeking ways to secure access to these vital resources. However, 90% of the current supply is in the hands of China, whose relationship with the U.S. and other countries has not been ideal of late. Despite best efforts, many nations remain dependent on Beijing for their [rare earth needs.](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/09/09/rare-earths-mmi-end-of-summer-rally/) Now, that could be starting to change.

[Explore our full metal catalog.](https://share.hsforms.com/1YNjZ4WqMSQyfBjCb5mO5KAchbup) # Rare Earth Magnets More Critical Than Ever These days, almost every progressive nation covets rare earth magnets due to their ability to deliver exceptionally strong magnetic force in compact sizes, enabling the construction of high-efficiency motors and miniaturized components. This is what allows them to power essential systems in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, medical devices, and defense equipment. [Credit: Peter Hansen](https://preview.redd.it/4rteoz7g2hsf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7d0d917c8e01c6d98dbf5e0ccf4f6e00bdee12) The magnets possess unique properties, such as heat resistance, which makes them even more critical in applications where performance and precision are crucial. So, as global industries shift toward electrification and automation, rare earth magnets have become strategic assets, with supply chain control increasingly viewed as a matter of national security. MetalMiner customers have saved millions of dollars by following MetalMiner’s industrial buying strategies. [Take a look at MetalMiner’s track record.](https://20963905.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20963905/MetalMiner%20Track%20Record.pdf) # China’s Dominance Remains an Issue Once again, China controls about 80% of rare earth magnets production. In total, the country produces over 200,000 tons of magnets annually, which accounts for the vast majority of the global supply. In contrast, North America and Europe together manufacture fewer than 2,000 tons, while Japan and Vietnam contribute about 25,000 tons. https://preview.redd.it/3k7w4jlj2hsf1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbdc8c4571758d0d0952a3cb8bbaa0144df1f1a Until about six months ago, the supply of these magnets from China to the rest of the world was going on well. Then Beijing decided to pull the plug and suspend exports to some of its key trading partners, including the U.S. and the European Union, in an apparent warning against proposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Since then, China has allowed limited exports, but it still maintains tighter controls to reinforce its geopolitical influence. # E.U. Import Up, U.S. Down Now, newly released data shows that the EU’s purchase of rare earth magnets increased in August this year, while imports to the U.S. declined. According to [news agency](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/china-s-magnet-exports-to-eu-surge-as-bloc-bears-brunt-of-crunch) Bloomberg, this points to concerns over resource security, as the European nations face the sharpest strain from tightening global magnet supplies. https://preview.redd.it/szm1nqgl2hsf1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1509111ebe38ee24f4509b244041abceb7a420 Meanwhile, analysts caution that intensifying trade tensions may further jeopardize access to these critical materials, threatening to derail Europe’s green technology goals and undermine its industrial competitiveness. In total, exports from China to the EU went up 21% in August, reaching 2,582 tons. At the same time, deliveries to the U.S. dropped 5% month-over-month, touching about 590 tons. The EU’s dependence on these magnets is clearly going north as the data showed that, year-to-date, imports from China had tripled compared to the U.S. According to experts, this serves to underline a larger shift in global supply dynamics. # New Western Production is Coming, Eventually For now, it seems China’s dominance in rare earth magnets will continue. According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/business/china-rare-earths-magnets.html) in the New York Times, the U.S. is trying to play catch-up with the Eastern nation. But despite these new efforts, the vast majority of the world’s magnet supply still originates from Chinese refineries. **The U.S. currently has four domestic magnet factories nearing completion. Meanwhile, in neighboring Canada, Neo Performance Materials just launched a major facility in Narva, Estonia. This site nearly doubles European and the U.S. production capacity and could scale to 5,000 tons. However, the NYT report also states that the full ramp-up will take years.** North America and Europe collectively purchase close to 40,000 tons of rare earth magnets each year. Therefore, setting up magnet factories in the U.S. and some other countries seems to be one way out of the China predicament. However, China’s dominance is rooted in decades of investment and near-total control over rare earth processing. It manufactures most of the world’s refining equipment and employs nearly all the specialized technicians. Some analysts say it will take years—even a decade—to break this stranglehold completely.

The crisis underlines the financial struggles faced by manufacturers of aluminium, nickel, copper and other metals amid significant declines in treatment and refining revenues, as well as rising energy costs. Brennan, who led the Productivity Commission from 2018 to 2023 and now heads think tank the e61 Institute, said it was sometimes difficult amid the chaos of a threatened closure and loss of jobs to discern whether something was a good deal and good value for money. Michael Brennan: “There’s a risk you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies.” Sydney Morning Herald “There’s always a significant risk governments get held ransom and you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies,” he said. Harris, who chaired the commission between 2013 and 2018, said there was a danger of adding “band-aid upon a band-aid”. “We’re clearly in danger of not recalling the lessons we’ve learned because we think this is new and mega because Trump’s made it a bigger thing,” he said of the focus on propping up domestic manufacturing under the banner of “resilience”. # Reform agenda Resilience, boosting productivity and making the federal budget more sustainable are the three themes of Chalmers’ economic roundtable in Canberra next month, which the treasurer hopes will spark a major reform agenda. Peter Harris: “We should be working out what is sustainable here.” Australian Financial Review Both Harris and Brennan said there were circumstances where it might be appropriate to support a business, such as helping it get through a period of unsustainable energy prices or investing in productivity-improving plant. But there needed to be a clear framework that meant requests were not being dealt with on an ad-hoc basis and provided benefits to taxpayers, rather than just doling out operational cash. “Things like sovereign capability and resilience can be difficult things to pin down. That’s not to say they’re not important, but what matters is you have a systematic framework by which you think through these things so you’re not hostage to sort of piecemeal, case-by-case crisis decisions,” Brennan said. “What does the taxpayer get in return?” Harris indicated that politicians often make decisions to solve an immediate political problem without considering more fundamental issues. “The biggest problem with these things is there needs to be some kind of assessment asking: is it genuinely sustainable if we do what they’re asking us to do, or is it sub-scale and unlikely to be sustainable?” he said. “Now is the time to turn the Industry Department’s heads away from ‘when opportunity knocks, let’s get some dough,’ to doing the analysis. We should be working out what is sustainable here.” That meant assessing domestic and international markets to decide whether manufacturers would be viable again or keep needing bailouts. He said it may be appropriate to continue propping up companies supplying the local market for sovereign capability reasons. # ‘Truly insane’ “You can make the domestic argument, but you certainly can’t make the export argument ... The idea of paying to export something is truly, truly insane. You’ve determined to subsidise foreigners,” Harris said. Howell said Nyrstar needed assistance to weather “several hundred million” in losses expected over the next two years while the company considers whether it can upgrade the plants to process the critical minerals. Hundreds of millions of dollars are also required for the rebuild of the Port Pirie smelter in SA, while a $400 million upgrade is needed at the Nyrstar smelter near Hobart. That plant had already secured $70 million of funding from the federal and Tasmanian governments, but work on that project was put on hold by the company late last year due to rising costs. The $50 million from the federal government was promised by both Labor and the Coalition during the 2022 election campaign.[ The *Financial Review* has previously revealed](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz) the responsible department has no record of being asked for the money by the recipient or anyone. The funds were also promised without a business case, analysis of the value proposition of the project, and no probity advice. While [Nyrstar has struggled to make a decent return](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/trafigura-wipes-266m-off-its-australian-smelters-20221209-p5c53d), Trafigura in 2022 and 2023 booked profits worth more than $US14 billion ($20 billion), with each year setting a fresh record. The Tomago aluminium smelter is the nation’s largest electricity user and discussions about its bailout package are focused on the smelter’s electricity contract for 2026 to 2029 and the design of federal Labor’s production tax credits. “They’re running around in Sydney and Canberra looking for a lot of money,” a source previously told the *Financial Review*. “It’s billions, not hundreds of millions. It’s eye-watering.” Tomago is 51.6 per cent owned by mining giant Rio Tinto and uses about 10 per cent of NSW’s power supply running around the clock. It employs about 1000 people directly and claims to create as many as 5000 indirect jobs. The facility, which is also part-owned by CSR and Hydro Aluminium, is the country’s biggest aluminium producer, generating about 590,000 tonnes a year or around 37 per cent of Australia’s primary aluminium.",Reddit

596,Global,2025-09,"How Many Jobs Are Available in Basic Industries?-When people discuss careers, most think of fields such as technology, finance, or healthcare. But behind every shiny product and service, there’s a backbone industry that keeps the economy running. These are called basic industries. They’re the sectors that provide raw materials, energy, and essential services. Without them, no other industry could function. But the big question is: **how many jobs are available in basic industries in the USA today?** Let’s break it down. # What Are Basic Industries? **Basic industries** are the ones that supply raw materials to all other sectors. They don’t make the final product you buy at the store; instead, they produce the essential building blocks. # Examples of Basic Industries * **Agriculture** (crops, livestock, food production) * **Mining** (coal, metals, minerals) * **Oil &amp; Gas** (exploration, drilling, refining) * **Forestry** (logging, paper, timber) * **Steel &amp; Metals** (iron, aluminum, copper) * **Utilities** (electricity, water, gas distribution) * **Construction Materials** (cement, wood, glass, stone) These sectors are called “basic” because without them, advanced industries such as technology, healthcare, or automotive wouldn’t exist. # How Many Jobs Are Available in Basic Industries in the USA? According to the **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**, millions of Americans work in basic industries. Here’s a breakdown: * **Agriculture, food, and related industries** employ over **22 million people** in the U.S. (USDA, 2023). 👉 Source:[ USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/) * **Mining, quarrying, and oil &amp; gas extraction** employ around **600,000 workers** (BLS, 2024). 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag21.htm) * **Utilities** employ about **540,000 workers** (BLS, 2023). 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag22.htm) * **Forestry and logging** employ nearly **50,000 people**. 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics3_113000.htm) * **Construction and industrial specialties** (heavily tied to basic industries) employ over **7.7 million people**. 👉 Source:[ Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/226323/us-construction-employment-since-2000/) So if we combine agriculture, energy, mining, forestry, utilities, and industrial specialties, the **basic industries sector supports over 30 million U.S. jobs** in total. # Is Basic Industries a Good Career Path? Yes — and here’s why: * **Stability** → These jobs provide essentials (food, energy, raw materials). They’ll never disappear. * **Growth** → Renewable energy, eco-farming, and advanced manufacturing are expanding. * **Diverse entry points** → You don’t always need a degree. Many jobs start with trade school, apprenticeships, or on-the-job training. * **Pay potential** → Skilled roles like petroleum engineer or power plant operator earn six figures. # Best Paying Jobs in Basic Industries Not all basic industry jobs are low-paying. Some pay six figures, especially in oil, gas, and utilities. Here are **examples of the best-paying jobs in basic industries**: * **Petroleum Engineer** → Average salary: **$131,800/year** (BLS). * **Chemical Engineer** → Average salary: **$105,500/year**. * **Industrial Production Manager** → Average salary: **$103,000/year**. * **Power Plant Operator** → Average salary: **$94,790/year**. * **Mining and Geological Engineer** → Average salary: **$100,090/year**. * **Agricultural Manager** → Average salary: **$75,760/year**. 👉 These jobs often pay more than many office jobs in other industries. # What Do Basic Industries Jobs Pay on Average? If you’re not in a top role like an engineer or manager, salaries are still competitive. On average: * Entry-level roles (farming, logging, construction helpers): **$30,000 – $45,000/year**. * Skilled trades (welders, electricians, machine operators): **$45,000 – $70,000/year**. * Advanced professionals (engineers, plant managers, supervisors): **$80,000 – $130,000/year**. So, depending on your skill level, you can earn anywhere from **$15/hr to six figures annually**. # Jobs in Basic Industries (Salary Breakdown) Here’s a **comprehensive list of jobs** across different basic industries — more detailed than Indeed’s version: # Agriculture &amp; Food * Farmworker – $33,000/year * Agricultural Technician – $45,000/year * Animal Caretaker – $62,430/year * Food Scientist – $74,160/year # Mining &amp; Oil * Miner – $57,408/year * Rigger (oil rigs) – $48,850/year * Drilling Engineer – $117,000/year * Geologist – $83,680/year # Forestry &amp; Paper * Logger – $67,371/year * Forest Technician – $42,000/year * Paper Mill Worker – $54,000/year # Metals &amp; Manufacturing * Welder – $57,766/year * Metal Worker – $53,492/year * Machinist – $50,000/year * Production Operator – $43,061/year # Utilities &amp; Energy * Power Plant Operator – $94,790/year * Electrician – $60,040/year * Line Installer – $78,310/year * Water Plant Technician – $52,000/year # Construction &amp; Industrial Specialties * Carpenter – $54,052/year * Forklift Operator – $37,869/year * Industrial Engineer – $95,300/year * Safety Supervisor – $70,000/year 👉 That’s 25+ roles already, each with different skills and pay. # How Many Jobs Are Available in Industrial Specialties?

597,Global,2025-07,"Why does Software/Computer Science pay more than traditional/mechanical engineering?-Main question is to discuss but also tell me what I offer should pick? Hello, So Ive been lucky to get multiple job offers I can take as a recent university graduate, I did a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. So the offers I received for the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms everyone knows and puts on a pedestal as well as the mining engineering Fly in fly out offer. Second path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical/mining engineering roles offered. I’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pay for mechanical/traditional engineers at the same top company FAANG was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path. Thanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role But I’m just really curious to why this is the case even matching at a top company so it’s a bit more even the software/tech engineers get paid more than the traditional/mechanical engineers like even from levels fyi and from my own experiences and offers and friends/acquaintances have told. Even my dad is a team lead in mining engineering as a mining engineer yet my Software Engineering offer at FAANG pays more than that which is crazy. TLDR, FAANG software engineering offer laid 130k more than my highest traditional engineering offers which included mechanical and mining engineering job offers at top firms for traditional engineers such as Boeing, Defence and Rio Tinto. Also FAANG offered me interview and salary for Software Engineer and Mechanical Engineer role but the Software Engineering role still paid significantly higher so I just went with that. My only gripe with not going with the software engineering job is that I won’t be seen as a real engineer by my family even though I’d earn more than them so I need help please guys with convincing my family too",Reddit

599,Global,2025-06,"Has the once premier Treasury department lost its mojo?-When Ted Evans ran the federal Treasury in the 1990s, the former telephone linesman spoke in a whisper, but he wasn’t shy of speaking truth to power. When he really wanted to make a point, he sometimes tapped his fist on the table. “No minister, you cannot do that,” Evans told treasurers and assistant treasurers, several past officials say. His successor, Ken Henry, delivered a [scathing assessment](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-jdx1w) of Howard government climate and water policies in front of the entire department’s staff in 2007, calling them “frankly bad”. Such fierce displays of independence are unthinkable for today’s Treasury, a sign of how much the department and politics have changed. For much of its 124-year history, Treasury has been a driving force behind economic policies that have made Australians among the richest in the world: far-reaching tax changes, balancing the budget, freeing financial and job markets, championing competition and selling government assets. Treasury’s advice guided the nation through shocks including the [2008 global financial crisis](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/how-australia-learned-the-wrong-lessons-from-the-gfc-20230913-p5e4bs) and [2020 pandemic](https://www.afr.com/politics/how-the-pandemic-changed-australia-in-2020-in-9-charts-20221201-p5c2tf), in lockstep with the Reserve Bank of Australia. Alongside the departments of prime minister, finance and foreign affairs, Treasury sits at the apex of the public service and has traditionally attracted the brightest economic policy minds. From their grand building inside Canberra’s rarefied parliamentary triangle, Treasury officers have been trusted advisers to prime ministers and treasurers and staunch defenders of the public interest. “Economic rationalism” ruled the day in Treasury’s golden age in the 1980s and 90s. That meant controlling government spending, advocating tax reform, opposing government interventions and promoting free markets. “Treasury’s contribution to the life, the development and the growth of our nation is far-reaching and long-lasting,” Evans wrote to mark the centenary of the Treasury in 2001. “That contribution reflects the several generations of Treasury people, public servants, who have assisted the governments of the day to improve the lot of all Australians.″⁣ But Treasury exceptionalism is now in question. Government spending, outside the pandemic, is the highest in 40 years. Despite huge revenue windfalls from Australia’s 20-year [mining boom](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5kywb), federal debt is about to blow through $1 trillion due to pandemic stimulus and a spending [surge led](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5kq5d) by the $50 billion National Disability Insurance Scheme. A [decade of budget deficits](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/debt-hits-seven-year-low-before-decade-of-deficits-20241001-p5kf03) is forecast. Productivity growth is the [worst in 60 years](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5lx9u). There has been no substantive tax reform in 25 years. Governments are more willing to intervene in the economy, re-regulating labour markets and subsidising industries with billions of dollars in taxpayer money. All of this has led to questions about the waning influence of the traditional premier department of government. An uncomfortable question is now being whispered in Canberra: “What’s happened to Treasury?” *The Australian Financial Review* has spoken to more than 30 current and former Treasury officials, former treasurers and economic policy experts to understand what is going on and how the department has changed. Some spoke anonymously to speak frankly or because most public servants are not authorised to speak publicly. Has the Treasury lost its hard economic rationalist edge? Is the problem not with the Treasury itself but its political masters? Does Treasury’s decline simply mirror the broader public service since John Howard’s “[night of the long knives](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5l9pv)” in 1996 when six department secretaries were sacked, putting a chill over frank and fearless advice? Can Treasury compete with investment banks and consultants for the best talent? In a post-pandemic political backdrop of big spending, [entitlement and policy cowardice](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5lwx0), the answers are important not only for the institution but also for the country because a strong and influential Treasury is crucial to the nation’s wellbeing. Former treasurer Peter Costello says the Treasury should be above the political influence of the treasurer of the day. Eamon Gallagher “Treasury should be a great department of state,” says Peter Costello, the Liberal treasurer from 1996 to 2007 when Evans and Henry were secretary. Treasury, he says, must be above the political whims of the treasurer of the day and the immediate political cycle. “It is not there to do short-term political bidding of the treasurer, or worse, for his political office. “He should do that for himself.” Under Treasurer Jim Chalmers and secretary Steven Kennedy, Treasury has proposed taxing [unrealised gains](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5m1hn) in superannuation, defended income tax [bracket creep](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5ldpj), backed imposing temporary price caps on coal and gas and argued that subsidies for household energy bills help reduce inflation. These interventions are not positions that Treasury would have backed in earlier decades, say experienced officials. Henry has criticised taxing unrealised gains, while economists have disputed that subsidies can sustainably lower inflation. Alex Sanchez, a former senior economic adviser to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, was underwhelmed by Treasury during his three years in government. “You would expect Treasury to be more aggressive on the economic challenges we have: low-cost \[emissions\] abatement. Dismal productivity. A broken tax system and the relentless growth in the state,” he says. “Instead we have an enfeebled institution which sees the cost of these problems transferred to Australians.” &gt; Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy and Treasurer Jim Chalmers in May 2022. **Chalmers and Kennedy speak most working days**. The treasurer and the man regarded as the most powerful bureaucrat in Canberra first crossed paths during the 2008 global financial crisis. Chalmers, then 30, was a political adviser to treasurer Wayne Swan, and Kennedy, about 15 years older, had been seconded from Treasury to prime minister Kevin Rudd’s office. The government took Henry’s advice to “go hard, go early and go households” with a $50 billion stimulus and guarantee for banks. After the crisis, Swan initiated the last attempt at major tax reform, a review led by Henry, finalised amid an iron ore price boom. But the botched attempt to introduce a mining super profits tax, which was comprehensively defeated by big miners BHP and Rio Tinto, burned Swan and contributed to Rudd losing his job. But today, Chalmers is a strident defender of the Treasury. He says no one in parliament has a more substantial appreciation of the department than him. “It’s well-led, deeply and centrally engaged, respected and influential, cerebral and consequential,” Chalmers says. “There’s not a major decision taken anywhere in our government or indeed any government that doesn’t take its advice into consideration in one way or another.” Chalmers is a left-of-centre Labor treasurer. In a defining essay in 2023, [*Capitalism after the crises*](https://www.themonthly.com.au/february-2023/essays/capitalism-after-crises), he proposed a grand vision for “values-based capitalism”, seen as a [shift away](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5cg93) from economic rationalist orthodoxy. He wrote about revamping the nation’s long-standing market-based economic model and attacked “neoliberalism”. Kennedy’s sympathies are also towards progressive policies. A psychiatric nurse earlier in his career, he cares deeply about climate change – for which he received the public service medal in 2016 – full employment and inequality. Kennedy is more comfortable with bigger government than past Treasury bosses. Kennedy has told colleagues that he prefers to be completely frank with treasurers – in private. He does not believe in running debates that could embarrass Chalmers, or his predecessor Josh Frydenberg, in public. That makes it difficult for outsiders to judge Treasury advice to the government because it is deliberately confidential. “The way I tend to approach Treasury is I want it to be relevant and influential to the decisions that the government is going to take,” Kennedy says*.* But he insists that Treasury forms its own views and remains at arms length from the elected government. “Of course, we’re a part of the executive, but we form our advice independently, and that’s what we focus on,” he says. “We won’t be directed by the government of either persuasion. We will sit down, and we will form our advice independently. “Certainly, you could criticise us that, you might think our advice is not as influential as it might be. I accept that could be the case.” Treasury pushed back against Albanese’s $8.5 billion election promise on Medicare and resisted his push to subsidise domestic-made solar panels, a senior official from another department says. But Albanese proceeded anyway. Another official says Treasury and the Department of Finance initially in 2022 suggested tougher budget rules, more substantial spending cuts and revenue measures, but there was no political appetite from the government. The rejections have made officials more cautious about recommending budget savings because they know that despite their many hours of work developing savings they are unlikely to be adopted, one of the officials says.

601,Global,2025-05,"Murray Watt’s first task as environment minister-Murray Watt, known for his effectiveness, is confident he can deliver long-delayed environmental reform. His first and most consequential task is the ‘carbon bomb’ project awaiting approval. By Mike Seccombe. Murray Watt’s appointment as environment minister gives Kelly O’Shanassy a measure of hope. “I do think that he’s a good appointment,” says the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, “because he has a reputation for fixing really hard things.” It’s true. Watt has come to be seen as one of the government’s foremost fixers, prepared to take on powerful, even dangerous, vested interests. As agriculture minister he took on the farming lobby and steered legislation through parliament, ending the live sheep export trade. As minister for employment and workplace relations, he pushed through laws cracking down on corruption in the construction industry, involving bikie gangs and the CFMEU, over the objections of that union and others with strong links to the Labor Party. He was given extra police protection at the time. Now, though, he confronts an even more intractable – if less physically dangerous – problem: reforming Australia’s main national environment law. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, legislated in 1999 by the Howard government, has been, to quote the prominent businessman and former Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman Graeme Samuel, “an abysmal failure”. In October 2019 then environment minister Sussan Ley appointed Samuel and an expert panel to review the EPBC Act. A year later the Samuel review came back with a damning report and called for a radical overhaul. Among its 38 recommendations were: legally binding national standards to protect wildlife, critical habitats and heritage sites; independent oversight and enforcement of those standards; the prioritisation of Indigenous engagement and protection of cultural heritage; better data collection; and reform of the environmental offsets regime, which did not adequately protect critical habitat from development. Nothing came of it. Just as nothing came of a previous independent review by eminent bureaucrat Allan Hawke 10 years earlier. “EPBC reform has been promised, and not been delivered, for nearly a decade and a half now,” says O’Shanassy. Now it has been promised again. As an indication of his intent to get it done this time, the prime minister has appointed the fixer. And as an indication of his intent, Watt almost immediately jetted off to Western Australia, a state whose Labor government stymied the most recent reform effort. “I wanted to make Western Australia my first interstate trip,” he tells The Saturday Paper from Perth on Wednesday. “You know, obviously there are some major decisions pending about projects, but my main job, as I see it, in this role, is to shepherd through reforms to the EPBC legislation. And I think everyone recognises that those laws were a particular flashpoint in Western Australia.” His trip west was a whirlwind of consultations: with Premier Roger Cook, with various state ministers whose responsibilities intersect with his, with mining groups, business groups, environment advocates and First Nations organisations. The breadth of Watt’s engagement with environmental organisations is impressive; among them O’Shanassy’s venerable ACF, as well as the Pew Charitable Trusts, Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace, WWF and the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation, chaired by former Treasury secretary and banker Ken Henry. “I’ve very deliberately chosen to meet a broad range of stakeholders because I’m genuinely interested in everyone’s point of view on these reforms,” he says. “I’m committed to being seen as an honest broker.” How he comes to be judged will of course depend in substantial part on whether or not he can land those reforms. Initial impressions, however, will depend on another decision he must take first. Watt has committed to making a call by the end of this month on a proposal to extend the life of Woodside Energy’s North West Shelf fossil gas project to 2070, which will in turn facilitate the opening up of new gas fields in the Browse Basin. “It is a slow-moving Juukan Gorge. If you want any credibility on First Nations rights in Australia, you really cannot be approving this gas processing plant.” If he waves it through, he will effectively detonate what O’Shanassy calls a “carbon bomb”, which will release the equivalent of an estimated 4.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is roughly 10 times Australia’s current total yearly emissions. Watt nevertheless considers his “main job” to be reform of the EPBC Act. Political machinations have always trumped environmental concerns, most risibly in 2022 when – literally on election eve – Labor’s shadow minister, Terri Butler, under challenge by the Greens in her Brisbane seat of Griffith, promised that, if elected, Labor would establish an independent environment protection agency. She lost her seat, although Labor won the election. In what was widely seen as a vindictive act, the new prime minister, Anthony Albanese, appointed his leadership rival Tanya Plibersek to the environment portfolio. Last November, Plibersek was close to striking a deal with the Greens and independent Senator David Pocock to get legislation through the Senate establishing an EPA. The Greens had dropped a demand for a climate trigger to be incorporated in the so-called Nature Positive legislation. This was a big concession on the Greens’ part. A climate trigger would have meant proposed developments would have been assessed on the basis of their greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on climate change. There was an agreement in writing. Without first informing Plibersek, however, Albanese summoned the then Greens leader Adam Bandt and environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young to tell them the deal was off. Premier Roger Cook claimed credit for pranging it, in the interests of his state’s powerful mining industry. Just ahead of this year’s election, Albanese also shot a large hole in the EPBC Act to protect the Tasmanian salmon farming industry. Under the law, the environment minister had the power to reconsider a decision to permit an activity if “substantial new information” came to light about its environmental impact. Conservation groups had called for such a reconsideration, on the basis that industrial fish farming in Tasmania’s Macquarie Harbour threatened the extinction of the Maugean skate. In order to prevent the loss of a relative handful of jobs in the industry and to improve Labor’s chances of winning a couple of seats in north-west Tasmania, the government pushed through legislation to amend the EPBC Act, severely limiting the reconsideration power. Environmental lawyers say the change has implications far beyond the fish-farming industry. The net result is that despite Plibersek’s efforts, Australia’s environment laws were arguably even weaker at the end of the Albanese government’s first term than they were at the start, when they already were clearly in urgent need of repair. As the 2021 state of the environment report summarised, conditions were “poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction.” Says O’Shanassy: “There’s an extinction crisis. More than 2000 species, plants and animals are threatened with extinction.” This is the mess Watt inherits. Under Plibersek, the reform process was broken into several tranches, an approach that was opposed by environment groups, for good reason. The bills Plibersek failed to get through parliament last year aimed to create two new bodies to inform decisions – Environment Protection Australia and Environment Information Australia – and establish better compliance and enforcement mechanisms. But as Justine Bell-James, an expert in environmental law at the University of Queensland, wrote in The Conversation this week, “the centrepiece of the initial reforms – the new environmental standards themselves – were missing”. O’Shanassy seconds this criticism. “We certainly prefer the reforms to be done together,” says O’Shanassy, “because they’re interconnected. If you create a national EPA without creating national environmental standards – which are essentially the rules that determine nature protection – then the EPA is going to be overseeing a broken act. “So our big ask of Murray is to get this done this year and make sure that we’ve got an EPA \[with\] national environmental standards.” It appears that is what Watt intends to do. “One thing I am considering is whether we broaden out the reforms beyond what was in the bill that we put to the parliament,” he says. “There seems to be quite a degree of support for doing that, across the spectrum.” “What was known as stage three of the reforms would have picked up things like setting national environmental standards … streamlining approvals processes, trying to eliminate duplication between the federal government and the state processes. So they’re the types of things that could potentially be rolled in to a broader package.” Watt suggests the post-election political climate might be conducive to more sweeping reform given the changes to the leadership of both the Greens and Liberal Party. “Sussan Ley was the minister for the environment who commissioned the Samuel review, that really kickstarted this reform process and if you look back at what she said at the time, you’d be able to find statements from her that she was supportive of the reforms. She wanted to legislate for national environmental standards,” he says. “Equally, I’ve noticed the comments from Larissa Waters, as the new Greens leader, that she wants to be a bit more constructive with the government than what we saw under Adam Bandt.” One thing Watt definitely won’t do, thoug...[Content truncated]",Reddit

606,Global,2025-05,"We all can make India Self-Reliant - some ideas - Embraer etc-Reason: Reg. future war preperation - we wont get time later. We need atleast 3 years to get these things in place and started production and export. Since 2014, **Modiji has pushed key reforms that laid groundwork for India’s manufacturing growth. Digital India and the Single Window clearance system cut bureaucratic delays, speeding approvals and improving ease of doing business—India jumped from 142nd to 63rd in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking**. PM Modiji and all Minister have done excellent work since 2014. Issue was mostly at bureaucratic levels. **Modiji should personally monitor (using digital records) of top 100 major Private companies starting in India and help them in case any babus create issues**. The Skill India mission trained over 10 million workers, boosting workforce readiness for industry. Make in India and Industrial Corridor projects like DMIC improved infrastructure and attracted $80+ billion in FDI between 2014 and 2023. GST unified taxes across states, reducing compliance costs by an estimated 20%. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have already led to $25 billion in incremental domestic manufacturing investment. These efforts combined have increased manufacturing’s share of GDP from 15% to about 17% and created over 5 million direct jobs. While progress is real, bureaucracy and supply chains still need tightening for India to fully break foreign dependencies and achieve long-term industrial independence. **As seen, in case of any future wars, India needs to have a resilient manufacturing system - and USA, China etc might not be as helpful to India because they fear us.** Hence, India should actively engage with higher probability countries and get things done. Those countries will be hesitant because of the bureaucratic red tapes and risk of inadvertent issues like strikes, state govt refusal etc. Govt should handle these beforehand. **Govt. should try and fix these** # 1. Regulatory + Bureaucratic Paralysis **Problem:** Land, labor, tax, and pollution clearances are delayed by red tape and department turf wars. Even state-level political games can kill centrally approved projects. **Solutions:** * **National Digital Clearance Grid (Single Window with SLA + Auto-Fines)** * All industrial projects must pass through a single portal with max 60-day SLA (auto-approved if crossed). * **₹50,000/day penalty on each department** that exceeds SLA. Public delay log auto-published monthly. * **Civil Accountability Law for Officers Causing Delays** * Bureaucrats who delay clearances without documented cause: * **₹1 lakh fine**, withheld promotion for 12 months. * Escalation reports reviewed every quarter by an **independent tribunal**. # 2. Skill Mismatch and Labor Readiness **Problem:** Indian labor lacks industrial discipline and high-precision training for semiconductors, robotics, or aerospace. **Solutions:** * **Industrial Co-Training Institutes with Global OEMs** * Partner with Siemens, Bosch, FANUC etc. to open 50+ co-run academies with 6-month in-plant apprenticeships. * Goal: Train 50,000 certified high-skill workers/year by 2028. * **Merit-Based Public Funding for Training Institutes** * ₹1,000 crore/year disbursed only to ITIs and colleges placing ≥80% students in core industrial roles. * Institutes ranked quarterly; bottom 30% get funding cut by 50%. # 3. Logistics and Infrastructure Bottlenecks **Problem:** Poor roads, unstable electricity, and customs delays cripple precision industry timelines. **Solutions:** * **Digitized Port &amp; Customs SLA System (Max 72 hrs)** * All industrial import/export clearances must go through a real-time online tracker with **72-hour SLA**. * Departments violating SLA fined ₹50,000/day. Escalated to ministry after 5 days. * **ISO-Compliant Industrial Corridors with Infra SLAs** * Grade-A infrastructure with 100% power uptime (dual grid + on-site backup), last-mile road access, and dry port within 10 km. * Run by **private Japanese/Korean infra firms** under 10-year maintenance contracts with quarterly audits. # 4. Lack of Industrial Ecosystem **Problem:** No local supply chains or precision tooling support for imported tech ecosystems. **Solutions:** * **₹5,000 Cr Industrial Vendor Boost Fund** * 50% capital subsidy for labs, cleanrooms, CNC/tool units, and material testing setups near MNC clusters. * Target: 1,000 domestic vendor units certified in 5 years. * **30% Localization Mandate with Exit Buyback Clause** * MNCs must localize 30% sourcing in 5 years or pay 10% industrial cess. * If they exit early, India has **right to buy physical assets at 50% depreciated cost**. # 5. Political Risk and Flip-Flop Policy **Problem:** Policies get reversed after elections, killing investor trust. **Solutions:** * **10-Year Investment Protection Law for Strategic Tech** * Guarantees on **tax rates, import policy, and subsidies** for a decade. Must be approved by Parliament, not just ministries. * Covers firms in semiconductors, defense electronics, robotics, energy storage, etc. * **State-Level Breach Penalty Clause** * If a state cancels a Centre-approved project, it must compensate 100% of sunk cost. * All contracts go through a **Centre-State Investment Tribunal** with 6-month decision deadline. **Countries that like India to progerss** # 1.

609,Global,2025-02,"Writing check/help for a 'Labor first, LNP last' election campaign for the Chinese community-Hi everyone, I am writing an article titled 'Labor first, LNP last' to distribute on the Chinese online social platforms to raise awareness amongst the Chinese ethnic voters that LNP is not our friend. （I'm considering the Chinese title to be 'Labor number 1, LNP number 6', because the word last doesnt really rhyme with first in Chinese. I'm hoping 'LNP number 6' might draw some attraction, been an odd thing to say) This was inspired by another post where someone shared a Facebook post with really informative content: [https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1ijnz86/i\_just\_found\_this\_comment\_on\_facebook\_im\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1ijnz86/i_just_found_this_comment_on_facebook_im_not/) I have incorporated most of that post into this writing with some minor additions, so full credit to them. I have quoted the passage used from the above post, so if you have read that post, you can skip most of the quoted passages here. There are several key topics which I believe will resonate with the Chinese community: wage stagnation and inflation, housing, tax breaks, immigration, and some touch on crime. While DEI is often seen as a none-issue for the Chinese community but I want to challenge that perception. I believe Niemoller's reflection, ""first, they came for..."" is the perfect opening punch for this article. Some parts have been translated from Chinese to English, so they might not flow prefectly. Even after few trims the writing is still quite lengthy (too much to write about!) so many thanks in advance for your time for reading it and I welcome any feedback and comments. I encourage everyone to share this, whether on a similar social platform for your ethnicity group or simply with your friends and social circle. You have my full permission and blessing etc etc. **Labor first, LNP last** In 1946, German pastor Martin Niemöller reflected on the German society and his silence during the rise of the Nazis: *""First, they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Communist.* *Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist.* *Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew.* *Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.""* **The LNP: A party for the wealthy, at war with the rest** Peter Dutton, the leader of Australia’s opposition (Liberal-National Party, LNP), has openly praised U.S. President Donald Trump, calling him a “big-picture dealmaker.” Meanwhile, Dutton has lead the LNP to launch its attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies at home, dismissing DEI policies in the Australian public service as roles do nothing to improve the lives of everyday Australians. Dutton’s attack on DEI is more than just a conservative talking point. It is a calculated strategy to dismantle hard-won protections for minorities, workers, and disadvantaged Australians. DEI programs aim to ensure fair access to opportunities for everyone. Dutton, closely following Trump’s rhetoric, has branded DEI as divisive and unnecessary. You may think that LGBTQ+ rights, Indigenous welfare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), trade unions, affirmative action, or women’s rights do not directly affect you. However, by tolerating or supporting oppression against these groups, you enable a broader erosion of social justice, one that ultimately affects everyone. As Niemöller warned, injustice left unchecked expands until no one is safe. Every attack on our society’s most vulnerable is a future assault against the next. This is the vicious cycle we are witnessing in the United States, and history has proven time and again that allowing injustice to persist only enables its expansion—until eventually, no one is safe. The LNP is not our friend. **LNP: champions of the ultra rich** &gt;As the next election approaches, expect to hear Coalition politicians and the Murdoch media blaming the “cost of living crisis,” “struggling families,” and the “housing crisis” on the Labor government. These are indeed issues of great concern, but we should take a closer look at how we got here. &gt;Since 1996, Australia has spent 20 years under Coalition governments. In that same period, Labor has governed for just 9 years—only 3 of which were in a minority government. This means the Coalition has had more than twice the time to shape and influence the Australia we live in today. &gt;When Labor took office in 2007, the Global Financial Crisis shook the world and devastated economies worldwide. Treasurer Wayne Swan was recognized by The Economist as the ""World’s Best Treasurer"" for steering Australia through the crisis. &gt;What ultimately led to the downfall of that government was its attempt to introduce a Resource Super Profits Tax (Mining Tax), aimed at ensuring that Australians shared in the wealth generated by the mining boom. (For more on this, read: ""Norway shows how Australia can get a fair return from oil and gas."") &gt;In 2010, the mining industry spent $28 million on a media campaign attacking the Labor government until Labor was forced to remove Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. Labor was then pressured into a compromise with the mining industry, resulting in a watered-down version of the tax. &gt;When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister in 2013, he completely abolished the mining tax. &gt;Rudd’s original tax plan was estimated to generate $12 billion per year—funds that could have been invested in government services, hospitals, schools, and local industries. &gt;So, where did that wealth go? (to name a few ) * Gina Rinehart is now worth over $30 billion. * Andrew Forrest has over $20 billion. * Clive Palmer has over $4 billion. &gt;Other billionaires you've probably never heard of—Kie Chi Wong, Sam Chong, Chris Wallin, Angela Bennett, Alexandra Burt, and Chris Ellison—have all made their fortunes from Australia's mining industry. Meanwhile, * BHP's annual profit is just under $20 billion, * Rio Tinto’s is around $18 billion, and * Fortescue’s is close to $15 billion. &gt;And what about ordinary Australians? &gt;Wages have stagnated, the cost of living has soared, and resource wealth that should have benefited all Australians has instead been funneled into the hands of a small group of already ultra-rich individuals—thanks to the Coalition’s policies. This is not economic prosperity; this is wealth extraction from the many to benefit the few. Some more LNP mess that should infuriate the timidest: * In the 1980s and 1990s, under Labor, Australia was a world leader in solar and renewable energy. From the 1990s to 2010s, the Coalition prioritized mining and LNG exports, causing a mass exodus of talent and innovation in renewable sector. * Labor introduced Australia’s National Broadband Network (NBN), which was mostly gutted by Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government in 2013. Under Turnbull, the LNP instead wasting billions of taxpayer dollars ‘upgrading’ Australia’s network with outdated technologies and setting back Australia’s internet infrastructure for decades. **Housing for the Rich, Struggles for the Rest: The LNP’s Legacy** &gt;In 1999, Coalition leader John Howard introduced a capital gains tax discount on investment properties, leading to a 400% increase in house prices, while average wages only grew by about 120% in the same period. &gt;In the 2019 election, Labor proposed reforms to make housing more affordable by reducing tax breaks for property investors, and investing in affordable housing. The Coalition and their wealthy backers used all their fear-mongering tactics and Shorten lost the election. &gt;The result? House prices doubled in major cities, and Australia’s housing crisis worsened. &gt;This election loss allowed Scott Morrison's Coalition government to govern for another three years—perhaps one of the most scandal-plagued and corrupt administrations in Australian history. Morrison’s biggest policy achievement? Tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest 5% of Australians. &gt;Three years ago, when Anthony Albanese and Labor came to power, they inherited a global inflation crisis. China, our largest trading partner, had imposed tariffs and trade bans on Australian exports due to Morrison’s foreign policy blunders. &gt;Albanese reversed Morrison’s tax cuts to provide greater relief to low-income earners. Inflation has since returned to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) preferred range—half of what it was under Morrison. Additionally, through careful diplomacy, all trade restrictions on Australian products have now been lifted by the Chinese government. &gt;Yes, housing is still an issue they have to fix. But this is not a mess they created, and there is no easy solution. &gt;I'm not going to sell you that Labor are the answer to all of Australia's problems right now, but if you look back over the past 30 years it's pretty clear that most of our problems started with a Coalition Prime Minister. &gt;Whatever problems we are facing, Peter Dutton's Coalition and their ultra wealthy backers like Gina Rinehart and Rupert Murdoch are only going to make it worse. **The Coalition’s Immigration Hypocrisy: Profits Over People** The Coalition brands itself as a ""tough on immigration"", often claiming that migration hurts jobs, infrastructure, and housing. However, ABS data shows that Australia's immigration takes were the same or even higher under LNP leadership. Why? Because big businesses thrive on our immigration policy to supply them with cheap labour. The Murdoch media and LNP pushes the narrative that ""foreigners are coming to take our jobs"" and slams Labor for opening our doors. But we are now in the realisation that the LNP and their corporate friends welcomes migrants with opening arms despite blaming migrates for our every woe.

I still reply and I’m still happy to answer questions. Hey! Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on this subreddit. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear) I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours) Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere. Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, Agnico Eagle Mines, AngloGold Ashanti, Gerald Group, Petrobras, Shell, starting their own firms, etc. Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest, as well as oil and gas trading), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris.

612,Global,2025-07,"Flavia Tata Nardini’s Fleet Space Technologies is an $800m company, but if it wasn’t for New Zealand entrepreneur Peter Beck’s Rocket Labs, it would still be grounded-# Flavia Tata Nardini’s Fleet Space Technologies is an $800m company, but if it wasn’t for New Zealand entrepreneur Peter Beck’s Rocket Labs, it would still be grounded Flavia Tata Nardini always wanted to be an astronaut. Now her space-tech firm is on its way to joining the ranks of unicorns, but she almost ran out of cash, twice. By Yolanda Redrup 8 min. readView original When Flavia Tata Nardini was a little girl living on a mountain outside Rome, she loved the night of San Lorenzo in the middle of summer. Italian legend says the shower of shooting stars that appears around August 10 evokes the fires that martyred St Lawrence. In reality, they come from the annual meteor shower created by the orbit of the Swift-Tuttle comet. “I was a space geek,” says Nardini. “It was the most beautiful thing, and it completely inspired me.” “I always wanted to be an astronaut, I just wanted to go to the stars,” she says. Today, Nardini is a rocket scientist and the co-founder of an $800 million company, [Fleet Space Technologies](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/management/this-moonshot-tech-firm-is-australia-s-fastest-growing-company-20231113-p5ejhe), which makes and sends shoebox-sized satellites into space and uses artificial intelligence technology to find critical mineral deposits. Nardini was the fourth of five children. Her mother taught English and French and her father was an architect and entrepreneur. Her parents divorced when she was 10, and her father had money troubles. Finding school “a little bit easy”, the teenage Nardini played basketball professionally, completed two degrees in aerospace engineering and got her first job as a rocket scientist at the European Space Agency. After a year, she joined the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research. “It was fun working with all these incredible missions – putting satellites on the moon, building propulsion systems for big launches, and this is where I understood that this passion for me was real,” Nardini says. “I was leading multibillion-dollar projects to go to Mars with satellites.” When she was 28, Nardini gave up her job for an Australian guy she had met in the Netherlands and relocated to Adelaide. She has two daughters, 12 and 9. Taking care of a baby, she says, with a chuckle, is harder than rocket science. At the time, Nardini was not worried about her career. She knew South Australia was a hub for defence tech and that the country was “techie”, but she soon discovered the city of churches was nothing like the bustling space tech community she had grown accustomed to in Europe. “I had this idea of building a rocket concept and most universities did not even understand what I was proposing,” Nardini says. “The only example of entrepreneurship I had was my dad. Entrepreneurship for me was not something connected to success, but was connected … to a lot of suffering.” She did not want to be an entrepreneur; she wanted to find a job, but when no jobs existed, Nardini was thrust into being a founder. **Her first company was not a runaway success**. Called LaunchBox, it taught school kids how to make small 3D-printed satellites, which they launched into space on weather balloons. She founded it with Matt Pearson, who she met at the University of Adelaide, Brian Lim and Inovar Technologies founder Matthew Tetlow. In 2015, Nardini, Pearson and Tetlow started Fleet. Within 20 minutes of Nardini having the idea for Fleet, Pearson had decided on the company name and bought the domain name. By the end of the day, he had also designed the logo, which the company still uses today. Matt Pearson, co-founder of Adelaide-based Fleet Space Technologies. Australian Financial Review They raised about $50,000 to fund the business. Pearson put in $25,000 of his own money and the government contributed $25,000 via a grant. “We were very passionate about the small satellites revolution,” she says. “We started doing what we knew how to do – building satellites, buying licences and doing the minimum.” A year in, they were approached by one of the country’s largest venture capital funds, Blackbird Ventures. Nardini had never heard of the fund and did not know anything about venture capital, but a month later [Blackbird’s co-founder Niki Scevak](https://www.afr.com/technology/why-blackbird-s-scevak-thinks-he-is-more-buffett-than-vc-20230215-p5cks4) emailed saying the fund would like to invest. “My first memory of Flavia a decade ago was of her magical ability to bring people together,” Scevak says. “Fleet started with no capital, but Flavia was able to get a satellite launched by running a program for school kids, partnering with a university satellite launch for free, and then including the first alpha version of Fleet on top. Blackbird ended up leading a $5 million round, which also had participation from Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok. “I sometimes look at the pitch deck we gave to Blackbird for that first round, and it was so good,” Nardini says. “It feels so energetic and powerful and inspiring. Sometimes Matt and I look at it and smile.” In that deck, they included their aspiration to explore not just the Earth, but also the moon and Mars. Next year, this goal will become a reality when its seismic technology lands on the moon’s surface aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lunar lander in its second lunar mission. **The fledgling space-tech company faced its first existential test in 2019**. The company had booked to launch satellites into orbit, including with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, but SpaceX was running six months behind schedule and Fleet’s money was running out. Nardini called fellow entrepreneur Peter Beck, the New Zealand-based chief executive of Rocket Lab. He was gearing up for his first orbital rocket launch and Nardini told him if Fleet didn’t get its satellites into orbit soon, Fleet was “dead”. Beck agreed to help but needed the satellites in Auckland in two weeks. The problem was that Fleet’s satellites were thousands of kilometres away with SpaceX in America. Pearson and Nardini raced to build two new satellites by hand using leftover spare parts. “I remember Peter asking me how much we could pay. Satellites like these are expensive – one kilogram in space costs $50,000 – and I said ‘we have nothing’,” Nardini says. “He said, ‘Okay, $1.’ That was the moment which Peter made me. We became friends, and I’ve launched many satellites with him after because he saved Fleet. “Entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs is the most wonderful thing”. The launch succeeded, and the pair kicked off a two-week roadshow in 2019, trying to raise its “Series A”, its first significant round of capital, from investors in the US, Hong Kong and Australia. Investors were slow to commit, and Fleet was again cash-strapped. Nardini was counting on Hong Kong’s Horizons Ventures, which was busy in the middle of the Zoom float. “I had a one-year-old and a three-year-old and I remember crying in the car,” Nardini says. “My three-year-old asked me why I was crying, and I said it was because I wasn’t sure if I could raise the Series A … and she said to me, ‘Why don’t you park the car and send them a message?’ “I did, I said, ‘I just want to let you know that we really need to close this, and we really need you guys to sign.’” That worked. Fleet banked $US7.4 million, led by Momenta Ventures and Grok, with contributions from Horizons Ventures, Blackbird and the South Australian government. **Fleet’s first big customer was Rio Tinto**. Its first big product was CSB ExoSphere, which uses nano-satellites, ground sensors and artificial intelligence to create 3D subsurface models for mineral exploration. The first contract was worth $250,000. “We had mass manufacturing, clients all over the world, and it all happened so fast after CSB,” Nardini says. “Artificial intelligence in this space is very complex. It’s very niche. It means you can find deposits without having to do 30,000 drill holes, you only need a handful. “It means you can find all the copper, without having the huge environmental impact.” Fleet’s first financial report las year revealed $26.8 million in sales, up from $9.2 million the year before, and over 75 per cent was from ExoSphere. Australia is the largest market for deployments, followed by Canada and South Asia. It also has a growing presence in Saudi Arabia, including a four-year contract with Saudi miner Maaden. The same year, Fleet raised $150 million in a Series D round, valuing the company at $800 million – on its way to joining the ranks of unicorns, start-ups worth over $1 billion. This year, Fleet bought HiSeis, a provider of seismic exploration technology, won a $1.6 million grant to teach secondary school students about satellite technology, and opened a global headquarters and factory at Adelaide Airport, enabling it to produce hundreds of satellites per year. A decision that helped accelerate Fleet’s growth, Nardini says, was narrowing the focus of the business further after each capital raise. It’s counterintuitive – more money often means opportunities to expand the breadth of the business – but Nardini knew she needed to hone in on Fleet’s core value proposition. After its Series A, Fleet focused on customers attached to the energy transition. After Series B, it went all in on resources and critical minerals, and after its $50 million Series C in 2023, it decided to focus on copper players. “My rule as an entrepreneur is as you grow, you focus. When you focus, that’s when the magic happens,” she says. **It hasn’t been an easy ride.** Nardini’s marriage broke up, her mother died, and after a difficult third pregnancy she spent seven months in a wheelchair. “I can’t tell you how I managed to survive that,” she reflects. “It was really, really hard.” The former couple remain friends and Nardini...[Content truncated]",Reddit

618,Global,2025-05,"King Charles III Announces Canada’s ReArm Europe Move: A Critical Minerals Boom Awaits-Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/king-charles-iii-announces-canada-s-re-arm-europe-move-a-critical-minerals-boom-awaits](https://www.juniorstocks.com/king-charles-iii-announces-canada-s-re-arm-europe-move-a-critical-minerals-boom-awaits) How Canada’s Mineral Wealth Could Power Europe’s Defense Boom https://preview.redd.it/0geklyd2rc3f1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcd69116cd4de9c8114ade2c9ae1f11155fda132 Canada’s military and economic playbook just got a serious upgrade. Today, King Charles III, in a rare throne speech appearance in Ottawa, announced Canada’s entry into the European Union’s ReArm Europe plan—now suavely rebranded as Readiness 2030 after some diplomatic side-eye from Italy and Spain \[\]. This move, aimed at boosting Europe’s military production and reducing reliance on U.S. arms, isn’t just about tanks and jets—it’s a golden opportunity for Canada’s critical minerals sector to shine. With a wink to geopolitics and a nod to economic savvy, Canada’s poised to cash in on Europe’s hunger for lithium, cobalt, and rare earths. Let’s unpack how this transatlantic handshake could reshape the critical minerals market, with all the facts and a dash of wit. **What’s the ReArm Europe Plan, Anyway?** The ReArm Europe plan, or Readiness 2030, is the EU’s ambitious €800 billion push to supercharge its defense industry, diversify supply chains, and flex some strategic muscle amid global tensions \[\]. Think of it as Europe’s answer to a world where U.S. reliability is wobbling (thanks, Trump) and China’s grip on critical minerals feels like a geopolitical chokehold \[\]. The plan, backed by the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), targets 10% domestic mineral extraction, 40% EU processing, and 25% recycling by 2030 \[\]. It’s a tall order, and Canada, with its treasure trove of critical minerals, is stepping up to be Europe’s new best friend \[\]. **Canada’s Critical Minerals: The EU’s New Crush** Canada’s no stranger to the critical minerals game. With vast reserves of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs), it’s like the cool kid with the best snacks at the global resource party \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan is set to crank up demand for these minerals, which are the backbone of defense tech—think batteries for drones, magnets for missiles, and electronics for fighter jets. Canada’s already a top supplier of 13 of the U.S.’s 35 critical minerals, including uranium and indium, and it’s eyeing a similar role for Europe \[\]. The EU’s desperate to loosen China’s 98% stranglehold on heavy REEs and other minerals like graphite \[\]. Enter Canada, with its stable politics and ESG-friendly mining cred. The 2021 Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials is already bearing fruit, with seven joint projects in battery production and lithium processing \[\]. Canada’s participation in ReArm Europe could turbocharge these efforts, funneling minerals like nickel and cobalt into European defense supply chains \[\]. Expect Canadian mining stocks to get a patriotic glow-up as EU contracts roll in. **Economic Upside: Jobs, Investment, and a Little Swagger** This isn’t just about rocks—it’s about jobs and economic swagger. Canada’s Critical Minerals Strategy, launched in 2022, has poured over $700 million into mining, processing, and recycling, with another $500 million from the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF) up for grabs in 2025 \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan could amplify this, drawing European investment into Canadian mines and processing facilities. Imagine French or German firms cozying up with Canadian SMEs to refine lithium or recycle REEs—cha-ching! \[\] Indigenous communities stand to gain, too. Canada’s strategy emphasizes economic reconciliation, with initiatives like the National Benefits Sharing Framework ensuring First Nations and Métis reap direct rewards from mining projects \[\]. The EU’s strict sustainability standards align with Canada’s push for responsible sourcing, potentially boosting Indigenous-led projects \[\]. It’s a win-win, assuming Canada can navigate the regulatory maze without tripping over its own red tape \[\]. **Challenges: Not All Glitter Is Gold** Of course, it’s not all maple syrup and rosy projections. Scaling up mining to meet EU demand means faster permitting—Canada’s eyeing the EU’s 27-month mining permit timeline as a model \[\]. But environmental pushback, like the protests over Portugal’s Barroso lithium mine, could haunt Canadian projects if not handled deftly \[\]. Competition from Australia and African nations, also cozying up to the EU, might keep mineral prices in check, squeezing Canadian margins \[\]. And let’s not forget China’s market muscle—its recent export bans on gallium and germanium sent prices soaring, a reminder of its power to rattle global supply chains \[\]. **Geopolitical Chess: Canada’s Checkmate?** Geopolitically, this is Canada playing 4D chess. With Trump’s NATO skepticism and Russia’s war in Ukraine shaking up alliances, Canada’s pivot to Europe is a strategic hedge \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan, coupled with Canada’s G7 presidency in 2025, gives Ottawa a megaphone to push for diversified, secure supply chains \[\].

This marks the largest jump in four years, driven by optimism surrounding trade deals and easing tensions with China. The Conference Board's report showed improvements in both the present situation index (125.9) and expectations index (72.8), indicating a more positive outlook for the economy and labor market. The rebound comes after five consecutive months of decline, largely attributed to the 90-day tariff truce between the U.S. and China, which helped alleviate trade war fears.

624,Global,2025-04,"Trump’s Ore-some Fast-Track: 10 Mines to Make America Shine-Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-s-ore-some-fast-track-10-mines-to-make-america-shine](https://www.juniorstocks.com/trump-s-ore-some-fast-track-10-mines-to-make-america-shine) A Bold Bet on America’s Mineral Independence https://preview.redd.it/zoesvrk2plwe1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935bc6bb282e16e76fc38849f7dc13304e3ed50d Buckle up, America, because the Trump administration is hitting the gas on a mineral revolution that could make the U.S. a powerhouse in critical resources! On April 18, 2025, the White House announced a bold move to fast-track 10 mining projects, a seismic shift to secure domestic supplies of copper, lithium, antimony, and more. This isn’t just a policy pivot—it’s a declaration of independence from foreign mineral overlords, particularly China, and a bullish bet on America’s economic and security future. With the stroke of an executive pen, President Trump’s Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production (March 20, 2025) has set the stage for a new era of self-reliance. Let’s dig into the dirt and unearth why this is the spark America’s been waiting for. **A Mineral Wake-Up Call** Picture this: the U.S., the world’s economic juggernaut, is 100% reliant on China for antimony, a mineral critical for everything from missile systems to advanced communications. Rare earths? We’re importing 70% from the same source. Copper, lithium, potash—the list of vulnerabilities reads like a geopolitical horror story ([The New York Times, April 16, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/climate/rare-earths-critical-minerals-china-united-states.html)). China’s recent export bans, like the one on six rare earths, have sounded the alarm louder than a foghorn at a library ([Reuters, April 15, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-signs-order-launching-probe-into-reliance-imported-critical-minerals-2025-04-15/)). The solution? A homegrown mineral boom, and Trump’s fast-track initiative is the dynamite to blast through bureaucratic red tape. These 10 projects, granted VIP status under the FAST-41 program—a 2015 federal gem that streamlines permitting without gutting environmental safeguards—are America’s ticket to mineral sovereignty. From Arizona’s copper caches to Idaho’s antimony treasure trove, this lineup is a strategic masterstroke to fuel defense, green energy, and infrastructure ([The White House, April 18, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/)). And the best part? The Federal Permitting Dashboard ensures every step is transparent, letting the public keep tabs like a hawk on a field mouse ([Permitting Council](https://www.permitting.gov/projects/title-41-fixing-americas-surface-transportation-act-fast-41)). **The Fab Ten: America’s Mineral All-Stars** Here’s the roster of the 10 projects poised to rewrite America’s mineral story, complete with their operators, minerals, and stock tickers for the Wall Street warriors among us ([Reuters, April 18, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/trump-fast-track-permitting-10-mining-projects-across-us-2025-04-18/), [MINING.COM, April 18, 2025](https://www.mining.com/web/trump-to-fast-track-permitting-for-10-mining-projects-across-us/)): https://preview.redd.it/5tk86zk7plwe1.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4583e292e3899cc0c10b427059b1105e06f4a902 These projects aren’t just holes in the ground—they’re the backbone of America’s future. Copper, the lifeblood of electrical grids and wind turbines, is in hot demand, with a single wind farm guzzling up to 15 million pounds ([Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/copper-driving-green-energy-revolution/)). Lithium, the darling of EV batteries, is set to power the clean energy revolution, while antimony could break China’s stranglehold on defense-critical supplies. Potash and phosphate? They’re the unsung heroes keeping America’s farms fertile and food security intact. **Industry Titans Roar Approval** The industry is buzzing like a beehive at a flower festival. Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, didn’t mince words: “Today’s Executive Order is a resounding endorsement of American mining, and the Stibnite Gold Project is a prime example of why critical mineral production in America requires immediate attention and prioritization” ([Perpetua Resources Press Release](https://www.investors.perpetuaresources.com/investors/news)). Stibnite alone could supply 35% of U.S. antimony demand in its first six years, a game-changer for national security. David Park, Standard Lithium’s CEO, was equally pumped: “This special status not only accelerates development but also supports efforts to provide a cost-effective, sustainable domestic lithium supply, vital for tech innovations in energy” ([Finimize](https://finimize.com/content/standard-lithiums-us-project-gets-green-light-from-trumps-executive-order)). Other heavyweights like Rio Tinto, Albemarle, and Hecla Mining haven’t dropped specific quotes, but the industry’s collective cheer is louder than a jackhammer at dawn ([Mining Weekly, April 21, 2025](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/trump-administration-fast-tracks-10-mining-projects-in-critical-minerals-push-2025-04-22)). **Why Domestic Supply Is Non-Negotiable** Let’s get real: relying on foreign minerals is like letting your neighbor control your Wi-Fi password. China’s dominance—100% of U.S. antimony, 70% of rare earths—leaves America vulnerable to supply chain shocks ([The New York Times, April 16, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/climate/rare-earths-critical-minerals-china-united-states.html)). With global demand for copper projected to hit 36.6 million tonnes by 2031 and lithium consumption expected to triple by 2030, the U.S. can’t afford to sit on the sidelines ([DNV](https://www.dnv.com/article/the-role-of-copper-in-the-energy-transition-247342/)). These projects are a clarion call to action, promising jobs, innovation, and a shield against geopolitical curveballs. Take Resolution Copper, one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper deposits, or McDermitt, a lithium behemoth poised to juice up America’s EV ambitions. Warrior Met Coal’s metallurgical coal will keep steel mills humming, while Michigan Potash ensures farmers aren’t at the mercy of global fertilizer markets. This isn’t just mining—it’s a strategic chess move to checkmate dependency. **Navigating the Rough Terrain** Sure, not everyone’s popping champagne. Resolution Copper has sparked pushback from Native American groups, a reminder that progress must tread carefully ([Bloomberg, April 19, 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-19/rio-tinto-bhp-s-resolution-copper-wins-fast-track-status-in-us)). But FAST-41 isn’t a regulatory bulldozer—it keeps environmental protections and public input intact, just with clearer timelines to avoid the 7–10-year permitting quagmires that make Australia’s 2–5 years look like a sprint ([U.S. Department of the Interior, April 17, 2025](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-adds-key-mining-projects-fast-41)). **The Road Ahead: More to Come** The White House isn’t stopping here. More projects will join the FAST-41 roster, a rolling thunder of mineral momentum ([The White House, April 18, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/)). Investors are already eyeing public players like Rio Tinto (RIO), Perpetua Resources (PPTA), and Albemarle (ALB), while private outfits like Lisbon Valley Mining and Michigan Potash keep things exclusive. The Federal Permitting Dashboard is your front-row seat to watch this saga unfold ([Permitting Dashboard](https://www.permits.performance.gov/)). **The Bottom Line** Trump’s fast-track gambit is a middle finger to foreign dependency and a love letter to American ingenuity. These 10 projects are more than mines—they’re the foundation of a self-reliant future, powering everything from tanks to Teslas. With industry titans cheering and the government clearing the path, the U.S. is poised to reclaim its mineral mojo. So, grab your hard hat, America—this is one dig that’s going to pay off big. **Sources:** 1.

The move is one of several planned for an executive order Trump could sign as soon as Wednesday after he told [the U.S. Congress last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-address-congress-after-upending-us-foreign-domestic-policies-2025-03-04/) he would ""take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA."" As part of the order, the Pentagon would work with other federal agencies to install processing facilities on its bases, according to the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the administration's deliberations. Using military bases for processing would underscore the importance Trump is placing on critical minerals for national security. Fighter jets, submarines, bullets and other weaponry used by the U.S. military are built with minerals processed by Beijing. Trump also plans to name a critical minerals czar, similar to steps previous presidents have taken to coordinate Washington's focus on other areas, according to one of the sources. The plans are under discussion and could change before Trump signs the order, the sources added. Some Trump administration officials were spooked by initial signs that China might [restrict critical minerals exports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/) as part of its retaliation for Trump's tariffs or for other reasons, according to a person familiar with their thinking.The U.S. National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. With the Pentagon controlling about 30 million acres of land, the plan would ensure there is available land for the refining facilities, avoiding the controversy that sometimes occurs in host local communities. It would also avoid the need to buy land and avoid using land controlled by other federal department. # A plan that prioritizes metals processing - rather than an overhaul of U.S. mine permitting -could irk U.S. miners but address a longstanding concern from manufacturers that China controls too much of the global metals processing sector. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the U.S. Geological Survey, for example. It's not clear how Trump's plan for processing facilities on Pentagon bases could work from a regulatory perspective, as the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act would still apply to Pentagon bases and those regulations have hindered private development of processing projects in the past. Trump previously signaled a willingness for alternative uses of lands controlled by Washington. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to open up portions of federal land for [large-scale housing construction](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-2024-09-05/), with zones that would be ""ultra-low tax and ultra-low regulation."" Trump does not plan in the order to establish a U.S. critical minerals stockpile that would mimic the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the sources said, a step that some in the administration and mining industry had sought. China stockpiles some critical minerals, including cobalt, and the U.S. government last year considered [stockpiling the metal](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/), which is used in missiles, aerospace parts, magnets for communication, and radar and guidance systems. Trump also does not plan to order the Pentagon or other U.S. agencies to require vendors to use only U.S. minerals, what is known as a ""Buy American"" mandate, and one that junior miners especially have said is needed to offset [China's market manipulations](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-miners-push-higher-metals-prices-ward-off-chinese-rivals-2024-07-22/). Nor would the order try to alter the federal mine permitting process, which was set by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, largely because such a move would require an act of Congress. However, it would aim to expand the FAST-41 permitting process for mines, building on a [step Trump took in his first term](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/trump-moves-loosen-mining-regulations-approve-projects-he-exits-2021-01-08/), according to the sources.

The order would also seek to reclassify mine waste on federal land, mimicking a step that Rio Tinto [(RIO.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RIO.AX), Freeport-McMoRan [(FCX.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/FCX.N) and others have taken to tap [piles of old waste rock](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/miners-turn-bacteria-other-new-ways-leach-copper-waste-rock-2022-05-11/) at U.S. mines previously thought to be worthless.

Phoenix-based Freeport, the largest U.S. copper miner, told Reuters on Monday it hopes Trump takes that step, which would [save it $500 million annually](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ceraweek-freeport-sees-500-million-annual-boost-if-trump-declares-copper-2025-03-10/). # MARCH 6th, 2025~The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals [The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals – The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/the-geopolitics-of-critical-minerals/) https://preview.redd.it/34e5isrrs1oe1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3837900f6d18552c2d3ecf0fcdabdb398222c222 Trans-Pacific View author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with Thijs Van de Graaf – associate professor at Ghent University, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, and lead author of IRENA’s report on the geopolitics of critical materials (2023) – is the 451st in The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series. **Explain the role and relevance of critical minerals in the global energy transition.** The energy transition is, at its core, a materials transition. Batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs) rely on lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements – making clean technologies far more mineral-intensive than fossil fuel systems. An electric car, for example, requires six times more minerals than a conventional one, and an offshore wind farm needs nine times more minerals per megawatt than a gas plant. But unlike fossil fuels, which must be constantly extracted and burned, minerals are a one-time input. Once mined, they can be used, reused, and recycled – shifting the security equation. The problem is not that we lack these materials, but that supply chains are fragile, refining is concentrated, and demand is rising faster than production can keep up. **Examine the impact of China-U.S. geopolitical tensions on critical minerals supply chains.** The China-U.S. rivalry is reshaping global supply chains for critical minerals. China dominates many aspects of the critical minerals supply chain, but it particularly controls refining and processing. While China only mines about 13 percent of global lithium resources, it refines over 60 percent of the world’s lithium. Similarly, it processes 85 percent of the world’s rare earths​. This dominance is not so much linked to resource endowment, but rather strategic industrial policy and capital investment over decades​. In response, the U.S. is racing to reshape supply chains, incentivize domestic production, and deepen partnerships with resource-rich allies like Australia and Canada. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has kickstarted major investment, while China has retaliated with export controls on gallium and germanium – signaling that critical minerals are now a geopolitical bargaining chip.

These have emerged as crucial components in the global push toward energy transition, defense applications, and technological advancement. The global market for critical minerals has been largely dominated by Chinese production and processing capabilities, particularly for rare earth elements crucial to defense applications and electric vehicles. This concentration of supply has prompted Western nations and companies to pursue alternative sources and supply chain. # The Market Dynamics in Trade Tensions Recent tariff announcements have significantly disrupted global metals markets, with nickel prices retreating to 2020 levels at approximately $14,000 per ton. As industry expert Mark Selby observed, &gt;***""Trump's done a great job basically wiping out the entire base metal complex, including nickel. So in the last few days here, we've taken prices all the way back to 2020 levels.""*** This price volatility reflects immediate market uncertainty rather than fundamental weakness in nickel's supply-demand dynamics. The implementation of wide-ranging tariffs has created confusion throughout supply chains that have developed over decades. # states Mark Selby, CEO Canada Nick Despite this near-term volatility, the market appears to be approaching what industry experts call the ""grand convergence,"" where various production methods approach cost parity. Current nickel prices have fallen well into the cost curve, suggesting limited additional downside potential. This cost-driven floor provides relative protection compared to other metals. While near-term volatility persists, the fundamental supply-demand dynamics remain supportive of stable to higher prices once policy clarity emerges. As Mark Selby succinctly observes: &gt;""This is some short-term pain, but this is, again, perversely super helpful for any of us in the critical mineral space who can sell our stuff anywhere in the world outside the United States."" # Government Support and Strategic Funding Policy developments in the United States have significantly strengthened the position of domestic critical mineral producers. The recent tariff announcements impacts with similar trends noted by Mark Selby in the nickel sector: &gt;***""This Trump nonsense basically just reinforces that stack \[of government funding\] is going to show up much more vigorously and much more quickly than it had before.""*** For companies like [**American Critical Minerals**](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/companies/american-critical-minerals), with projects addressing multiple critical minerals (both potash and lithium), developments create significant opportunities for accelerated permitting and financial support. [President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) aimed at accelerating domestic production of critical minerals, including potash and lithium. American Critical Minerals Corp., which is developing the Green River Potash and Lithium Project in Utah, has welcomed this development. In a [news release](https://acmineralscorp.com/news-releases/american-critical-minerals-applauds-us-presidential-executive-order-to-increase-expedite-domestic-critical-mineral-extraction/), President and CEO of American Critical Minerals, Simon Clarke expresses the company's take, &gt;""We are delighted that Potash is now being officially treated as a Critical Mineral in the US. Given the growth in domestic agriculture, and the fact that potash is the major ingredient in all key fertilizers, it is clear that being reliant on foreign powers for over 92% of the potash it consumes is a threat to US Food Security."" The Executive Order includes several provisions that could directly benefit critical mineral projects, including invoking the Defense Production Act, facilitating buyer agreements, expediting procurement, accelerating access to private and public capital, and creating a Dedicated Mineral and Mineral Production Fund for Domestic Investments administered by the Development Finance Corporation. [**Pensana**](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/companies/pensana-plc)'s Chairman Paul Atherley added his observation highlighting EXIM's support (to [Rare Element Resources](https://www.rareelementresources.com/investor-information/news-releases/2025/03/25/rare-element-resources-announces-exim-letter-of-interest-for-bear-lodge-project-funding)) to increase the american mineral production including rare earths: &gt;***""There is some great work being done by EXIM Bank. They have just announced a strategic critical minerals resource initiative, it's to realign supply chains to the US.***"" # Strategic Adaptations to Trade Disruptions Companies with production flexibility across different markets hold advantages during this period of trade uncertainty. For critical mineral producers, the ability to sell into multiple markets provides resilience against market disruptions. As Selby confirms, ""All of this Trump stuff is net-net long-term helpful for us"" in terms of accelerating government funding and support for critical mineral projects outside the US market. This disruption presents strategic opportunities for those positioned correctly in the market. Companies that can redirect production to markets outside the United States face less exposure to tariff impacts. For development-stage projects, governmental support is likely to increase as nations prioritize domestic supply chains.

627,Global,2025-04,"#NIOCORP~Opinion: A Federal Critical Mineral Processing Initiative: Securing U.S. Mineral Independence from China, Trump plans order to enable critical metals stockpiling: Financial Times quick post....-# APRIL 14th, 2025~A Federal Critical Mineral Processing Initiative: Securing U.S. Mineral Independence from China [A Federal Critical Mineral Processing Initiative: Securing U.S. Mineral Independence from China - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/a-federal-critical-mineral-processing-initiative-securing-u-s-mineral-independence-from-china/) https://preview.redd.it/127fj7b1xrue1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d9b37e64fa640550cab6c387ad0bed8eb80785 China currently dominates global refining for critical minerals essential to modern economies — including lithium, cobalt, nickel, natural graphite, and rare earth elements — making it the primary supplier of processed inputs for advanced technologies, such as semiconductors, aerospace components, energy storage systems, and electric vehicle batteries. Even minerals mined outside of China are often sent to Chinese-owned smelting and processing plants. This near-monopoly grants Beijing significant leverage over global supply chains, heightening concerns over U.S. dependence on Chinese-controlled refining operations. China’s [recent](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) export controls on processed rare earth elements, issued in response to U.S. tariffs, bring into focus this strategic vulnerability. The U.S. military depends heavily on these minerals for a variety of [defense applications](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/national-security/). For example, gallium-arsenide chips are used in electronic warfare systems that power the [AN/ALQ-99 jamming pod](https://www.navair.navy.mil/product/ALQ-99-Tactical-Jamming-System), neodymium-iron-boron magnets are [critical](https://www.sfa-oxford.com/knowledge-and-insights/critical-minerals-in-low-carbon-and-future-technologies/critical-minerals-in-defence-and-national-security/) to the F-35’s flight control systems, and antimony is used in ammunition and artillery shells. These dependencies underscore the national security risks posed by China’s dominance in critical mineral refining. Although encouraging private sector investments in refining, friendshoring, stockpiling resources, and streamlining permits has been helpful, these efforts fail to address a core issue: The United States lacks domestic refining and advanced processing capabilities. To achieve true mineral independence, the United States should adopt offensive industrial policies that build up the mineral refining sector. This requires establishing a federal initiative for critical mineral processing that builds on existing efforts by expanding funding, prioritizing states with optimal conditions for facilities, streamlining permitting, investing in workforce development, and securing allied supply chains. **Current Defensive Solutions Help but Face Significant Hurdles** China has historically weaponized its mineral dominance by imposing export restrictions on strategic materials to pressure rival economies. In [2010](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/revisiting-china-japan-rare-earths-dispute-2010), China restricted [rare earth elements exports](https://www.netl.doe.gov/resource-sustainability/critical-minerals-and-materials/rare-earth-elements) to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, triggering price spikes worldwide. In [2023](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_germanium_and_gallium.pdf) and [2024](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2024/long-term-outlook-of-gallium-remains-uncertain/), China imposed export controls on germanium and gallium, which are critical for semiconductor production. The United States has taken different approaches in response to these restrictions. After China’s 2010 rare earth elements embargo, the United States, the European Union, and Japan filed a [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earths_trade_dispute) against China at the World Trade Organization, ultimately forcing Beijing to remove export quotas by 2015. The United States also [revived](https://www.geologyforinvestors.com/mountain-pass-americas-once-and-future-rare-earth-king/) rare earth mineral processing, including efforts to reopen the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine in California. In 2023, Washington intensified its “[friendshoring](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/05/friendshoring-critical-minerals-what-could-the-us-and-its-partners-produce?lang=en)” strategy by allocating additional resources to domestic mining and refining through the Department of Defense and Department of Energy budgets, while also strengthening supply chain partnerships with allies like Canada and Australia. U.S. efforts to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals face a number of significant hurdles. First, domestic refining expansion remains slow, with new processing plants and smelters taking 10–20 years to become operational. For example, the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine, which reopened after China’s 2010 export controls, still sent [98 percent](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_rare_earths_part_1.pdf) of its raw materials to China in 2019 due to the lack of U.S. processing capacity. Investors are hesitant to fund U.S. refining and processing facilities due to [uncertain returns](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A-Critical-Minerals-Policy-for-the-United-States-Final-Report.pdf), shifting federal policies, political instability, and environmental [opposition](https://www.erm.com/insights/critical-minerals-how-the-mining-sector-can-accelerate-the-energy-transition/). High-capital expenditures make mining and processing less attractive to investors, especially when compared to tech sectors that require minimal upfront investment and offer higher returns. Additionally, China maintains a fully integrated supply chain — from extraction to refining, smelting, and manufacturing — making it far cheaper and more efficient to process minerals domestically than in the United States. Expanding U.S. domestic mineral extraction is also challenging, as moving from exploration to consultation and full-scale operations can take at least a decade. Even if extraction increases, investors remain concerned that Chinese firms could [flood](https://www.wsj.com/business/china-us-critical-minerals-fight-50b5cbda) the market with minerals to drive down prices and make U.S. operations financially unsustainable. This played out with lithium in 2023, when oversupply triggered a sharp drop in prices. Similarly, although not driven by deliberate economic policies, nickel prices fell in 2024 due to overproduction by Chinese firms focused on short-term profits. This trend was further amplified by the adoption of a new chemical [processing](https://www.strausscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Alvin-Camba-Indonesia-Memo.pdf) technique that significantly boosted output. Because extraction and refining must scale together to create a cost-effective, fully integrated U.S. supply chain, these barriers severely hinder progress. Second, while capacity is gradually expanding, alternatives to Chinese processing and refining remain. In Japan, companies like [Sumitomo](https://www.smm.co.jp/en/corp_info/location/overseas_group/) Metal Mining have historically focused on refining nickel and cobalt, but the government has recently [taken](https://www.sojitz.com/en/news/article/20230307.html) steps to expand rare earth refining. The Australian government is also scaling up support for rare earths processing, providing [grants](https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/king/media-releases/supporting-rare-earths-processing-future-made-australia) to firms such as Australian Strategic Materials Limited and extending [financing](https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/king/media-releases/additional-help-rare-earths-refining-future-made-australia) to Iluka Resources. In South Korea, [Korean Zinc Company, Ltd.](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/korea-zinc-talks-with-us-buyers-supply-antimony-chairman-says-2025-01-09/); POSCO Future M Company, Ltd.; and LS-Nikko Copper Inc. are active in [mineral processing](https://www.kedglobal.com/batteries/newsView/ked202411190004). Despite the efforts of these three countries, China still dominates [85 percent](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/14/rare-earth-mines-00071102) of rare earth refining, [90 percent](https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog/post/57351/china-is-the-worlds-leading-graphite-pro) of global graphite processing, and nearly all of germanium, gallium, and tungsten refining. Japan, Australia, and South Korea also face capacity constraints, higher processing costs, and competing [domestic priorities](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/south-koreas-demand-for-critical-minerals/) that limit their ability to fully support U.S. demand. Moreover, their geographic [proximity](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/asia-new-center-geopolitics) to China heightens their vulnerability in the event of armed conflict. Third, while stockpiles can provide a temporary [buffer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235963503_Limits_to_the_critical_raw_materials_approach), they do not eliminate the need for secure, long-term supply chains, as reserves will eventually deplete. China’s [dominance](https://optilogic.com/resources/blog/how-chinas-rare-earth-metals-export-ban-will-impact-supply-chains/) in the sector makes it difficult for the United States to determine optimal stockpile levels, especially given competing demands between military and civilian industries.

628,Global,2024-12,"Mineral &amp; Energy Economics: Colorado School of Mines -Hey! Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on this subreddit. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear) I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours) Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere. Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc. Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

Will people still come out for wallabies test matches next year? Can you really just blame lack of centralisation for the bad results and leave it at that. But unfortunately alot of the interview goes on about Eddie, he's gone now. what's the plan for the fucking future. He says grassroots and state reformation through centralisation and alignment. He acknowledges the system is broken. They go on to talk about branding, how the wallabies brand is damaged, he states it can bounce back referencing the springboks after 2017, saying victory is needed. He is then compared to Qantas and Rio Tinto ceos stepping down due lack of accountability, and asked what's the difference in sporting industry compared to regular corporate industry. He says that because he is passionate about rugby, he should therefore stay. Then was the wallabies 2023 campaign overbudget?, apparently yes. apparently significantly so. Goes onto to talk about Eddie talking to Japan before the RWC and his personal feelings on the matter, states Eddie's agent and Eddie confirmed that there was nothing in it. Says time will tell if he lied or not. Talks about how he took the job when no one wanted it, and that Phil Waugh will be an extremely competent CEO. Talks about how alot of past CEOs and Chairman's were old boys from the Shore School and if that's nepotism. He states it's purely coincidental, and is then asked about the games elite status problem. He says they are trying to make it less so by spreading the RWC to every states, by planning to invest more into grassroots in the future and how they want Western Sydney suburbs access for talent. The tineline for the alignment and centralisation of Australian rugby is that it depends on the different state unions. Goes on about how they need a strong team to captalise on lions, rwc 2027 and wrwc 2029. That the new wallabies coach recruitment process will be as transparent as possible, says the role is still very attractive.

What I’ve heard: 1) ECU is less prestigious but has been steadily developing its reputation and is good now 2) Life at ECU is more manageable I.e the lecturers teach better, are more supportive and campus vibe is better 3) Best companies only want people from prestigious universities so Curtin is better 4) Curtin is over crowded and less supportive teaching community *shall we assume my average is 65% should I graduate from Curtin and 72% from ECU My Questions: 1) How will going to ECU affect me getting into a good company say Rio Tinto or BHP as compared to Curtin 2) Neither of these programs seem to be accredited so how does that affect my career trajectory? Do I need to do some exams to be accredited and then become an engineer? 3) in Australia have you seen it be difficult for internationals to land good FIFO grad programs? I assume to remedy this I should do extra activities and internships thus maybe its better to go ECU because I’ll have more time and support to do this?

The move is one of several planned for an executive order Trump could sign as soon as Wednesday after he told [the U.S. Congress last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-address-congress-after-upending-us-foreign-domestic-policies-2025-03-04/) he would ""take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA."" As part of the order, the Pentagon would work with other federal agencies to install processing facilities on its bases, according to the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the administration's deliberations. Using military bases for processing would underscore the importance Trump is placing on critical minerals for national security. Fighter jets, submarines, bullets and other weaponry used by the U.S. military are built with minerals processed by Beijing. Trump also plans to name a critical minerals czar, similar to steps previous presidents have taken to coordinate Washington's focus on other areas, according to one of the sources. The plans are under discussion and could change before Trump signs the order, the sources added. Some Trump administration officials were spooked by initial signs that China might [restrict critical minerals exports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/) as part of its retaliation for Trump's tariffs or for other reasons, according to a person familiar with their thinking.The U.S. National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. With the Pentagon controlling about 30 million acres of land, the plan would ensure there is available land for the refining facilities, avoiding the controversy that sometimes occurs in host local communities. It would also avoid the need to buy land and avoid using land controlled by other federal department. # A plan that prioritizes metals processing - rather than an overhaul of U.S. mine permitting -could irk U.S. miners but address a longstanding concern from manufacturers that China controls too much of the global metals processing sector. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the U.S. Geological Survey, for example. It's not clear how Trump's plan for processing facilities on Pentagon bases could work from a regulatory perspective, as the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act would still apply to Pentagon bases and those regulations have hindered private development of processing projects in the past. Trump previously signaled a willingness for alternative uses of lands controlled by Washington. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to open up portions of federal land for [large-scale housing construction](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-2024-09-05/), with zones that would be ""ultra-low tax and ultra-low regulation."" Trump does not plan in the order to establish a U.S. critical minerals stockpile that would mimic the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the sources said, a step that some in the administration and mining industry had sought. China stockpiles some critical minerals, including cobalt, and the U.S. government last year considered [stockpiling the metal](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/), which is used in missiles, aerospace parts, magnets for communication, and radar and guidance systems. Trump also does not plan to order the Pentagon or other U.S. agencies to require vendors to use only U.S. minerals, what is known as a ""Buy American"" mandate, and one that junior miners especially have said is needed to offset [China's market manipulations](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-miners-push-higher-metals-prices-ward-off-chinese-rivals-2024-07-22/). Nor would the order try to alter the federal mine permitting process, which was set by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, largely because such a move would require an act of Congress. However, it would aim to expand the FAST-41 permitting process for mines, building on a [step Trump took in his first term](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/trump-moves-loosen-mining-regulations-approve-projects-he-exits-2021-01-08/), according to the sources.

The order would also seek to reclassify mine waste on federal land, mimicking a step that Rio Tinto [(RIO.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RIO.AX), Freeport-McMoRan [(FCX.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/FCX.N) and others have taken to tap [piles of old waste rock](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/miners-turn-bacteria-other-new-ways-leach-copper-waste-rock-2022-05-11/) at U.S. mines previously thought to be worthless.

This conversation with Thijs Van de Graaf – associate professor at Ghent University, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, and lead author of IRENA’s report on the geopolitics of critical materials (2023) – is the 451st in The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series. **Explain the role and relevance of critical minerals in the global energy transition.** The energy transition is, at its core, a materials transition. Batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs) rely on lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements – making clean technologies far more mineral-intensive than fossil fuel systems. An electric car, for example, requires six times more minerals than a conventional one, and an offshore wind farm needs nine times more minerals per megawatt than a gas plant. But unlike fossil fuels, which must be constantly extracted and burned, minerals are a one-time input. Once mined, they can be used, reused, and recycled – shifting the security equation. The problem is not that we lack these materials, but that supply chains are fragile, refining is concentrated, and demand is rising faster than production can keep up. **Examine the impact of China-U.S. geopolitical tensions on critical minerals supply chains.** The China-U.S. rivalry is reshaping global supply chains for critical minerals. China dominates many aspects of the critical minerals supply chain, but it particularly controls refining and processing. While China only mines about 13 percent of global lithium resources, it refines over 60 percent of the world’s lithium. Similarly, it processes 85 percent of the world’s rare earths​. This dominance is not so much linked to resource endowment, but rather strategic industrial policy and capital investment over decades​. In response, the U.S. is racing to reshape supply chains, incentivize domestic production, and deepen partnerships with resource-rich allies like Australia and Canada. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has kickstarted major investment, while China has retaliated with export controls on gallium and germanium – signaling that critical minerals are now a geopolitical bargaining chip. The result is a fragmenting supply chain, with competing industrial blocs forming. But reshoring and diversification take time, and in the short term, bottlenecks, price volatility, and political risk will define the landscape. **What other geopolitical risks are affecting developments in the critical minerals industry?** Beyond China-U...[Content truncated]",Reddit

637,Global,2024-10,"Advice for moving from FIFO engineering to a city engineering job-Hi all, Just for some background: I’m a 25-year-old mechanical engineer working FIFO as a mechanical maintenance engineer for Rio Tinto. I live in Perth, Western Australia, and fly to the Pilbara on an 8:6 roster. My day-to-day focuses on maintaining assets such as crushers, vibrating screens, conveyors, stackers, reclaimers, ship loaders, and more. The main goal of my role is to get assets running again after a major breakdown or when they aren’t operating as designed. This involves a lot of quick thinking and problem-solving under time pressure. When there are no breakdowns, my work shifts to defect elimination (DE) projects aimed at improving the reliability, safety, or ergonomics of the equipment. These projects often result from investigations into past breakdowns or plant inefficiencies. However, since I work for the client, much of the detailed design engineering for these DE projects is outsourced to external consultancies specializing in specific equipment or processes. For example, these consultancies might perform FEA analyses or redesign hydraulic circuits. My role, on the other hand, involves coming up with the initial concept and scope, overseeing the design to ensure it meets Australian standards and company guidelines, and confirming that it works practically without introducing safety or ergonomic issues for the teams working on the equipment. Now to my concern: My goal is to return to a city-based role after 3-5 years in my current job (I’m currently one year in). However, I realize that I won’t have the same level of technical design experience as many engineers working in consultancies, which is a bit concerning. That said, I don’t really want to move into a design-focused role—I love what I do now, which involves broader engineering responsibilities, managing people, and working through breakdowns. My preference would be to transition into a project engineering role or a position that values the skills I’ll develop on-site. So, my question is: Is it realistic to secure a city-based engineering job coming from my current role? Any advice or insights from people who’ve made similar transitions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",Reddit

639,Global,2025-01,"JAN 29, 2025 MUX.TO MCEWEN MINING TO MAKE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT INTO GOLIATH RESOURCES-https://preview.redd.it/32l10gfoa3ge1.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70a46ab51fb55eccfa8d9bef1c6275a85c0dff22 TORONTO, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Goliath Resources Limited (TSX-V: GOT) (OTCQB: GOTRF) (FSE: B4IF)** (the **“Company”** or **“Goliath”** ) is pleased to announce that an agreement has been made for **McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX)** to make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources. **Strategic Investment Highlights** * Post transaction, McEwen Mining will own 3.76% of the issued and outstanding shares of Goliath Resources. * McEwen Mining will pay in McEwen Mining shares worth C$10 million based on the closing price of McEwen Mining and Goliath Resources on January 28, 2025. * McEwen Mining will receive a half warrant, exercisable at C$2.50 for 12 months. * Goliath Resources will own 868,056 shares of McEwen Mining. **Roger Rosmus, Founder and CEO of Goliath Resources, states:** *“We are delighted to have McEwen Mining make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources. Rob McEwen recognized the potential of our Surebet high-grade gold discovery in 2023, and has made three personal investments through private placements since then. Our 2024 drilling campaign was a major breakthrough season for the Surebet high-grade gold discovery in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. The discovery is noted for having a series of stacked gently dipping veins with widespread high-grade gold. It is fortunate to have a remarkable content of visible gold which is in all the rock units (sediments, contact of the sediments and volcanics, and in the volcanics, as well as in the intrusion related dykes) with abundant fine-grained visible gold, including coarse-grained visible gold. In our 2023 drilling, we found visible gold in 32% of the drill holes and in 2024 that increased to 92%. Our recently reported drill hole intersection was our best to date returning 10 meters of 132.93 g/t gold equivalent (plus several high-grade holes with multiple intercepts, system remains wide open) making for a gram/meter intersection that puts it in the top percentile of all intersections throughout the world in the past 20 years. Each season we have seen the discovery get better and saw several pleasant surprises in 2024, including the high percentage of visible gold in our deeper drilling into the system, and our remarkable recently reported intersection. We still have 89 pending holes from the 2024 drilling season to report and think we may have made a second important discovery, this one a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) 35 km to the north of Surebet. Rob* *McEwen* *is a member of the Order of Canada and a Canadian Mining Hall of Fame member due to his record of philanthropy and* *the tremendous success he had building Goldcorp from a small gold miner to a success story when Goldcorp mined its bonanza-zone at their Red Lake Mine, making it one of the lowest cost miners of high-grade gold in the gold mining sector. His recognition of the success of the Surebet discovery in 2023 has been greatly appreciated and we are pleased to have McEwen Mining join our shareholder roster with this strategic investment. We are also very pleased that Goliath Resources will be a significant shareholder of McEwen Mining due to their combination of being a gold miner, their extensive drilling on their gold projects and their world-class copper asset that is in the top 10 undeveloped copper projects ranking in the lowest cost quartile as well.”* **Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner of McEwen Mining, states:** “ *The Goliath Resources team has done a terrific job advancing their Surebet high-grade gold discovery in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia and McEwen Mining is thrilled to make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources. What initially caught my attention was the high-grade gold they discovered, and that it was a grassroots discovery in the Golden Triangle which is a prolific gold mining jurisdiction, one of the most important in Canada. Worldwide, grassroots discoveries of high-grade gold in a mining-friendly jurisdiction well-known for high-grade gold mines are exceedingly rare. They were able to make the grassroots discovery due to it until fairly recently being covered by glaciers and permanent snowpack that have receded to expose a large area of outcropping rock that has now been significantly advanced over the past few drilling seasons. McEwen Mining is committed to gold mining, our gold mines are benefitting from the record high prices of gold in 2024 and we have an updated resource coming out in the first quarter of 2025 on our Fox Complex, where we also have a 69,500 meter (budgeted for $9.7 million) drilling campaign underway. We are also moving our Los Azules copper development project toward a feasibility study in the first half of 2025 and are contemplating taking McEwen Copper public after the feasibility study is published* *(McEwen Mining owns 46.4% of McEwen Copper, Stellantis owns 18.3%, Nuton is a Rio Tinto venture that owns 17.2% and Rob McEwen owns 12.7% of McEwen Copper). I believe strongly that the future is very bright for both copper and gold, and that McEwen Mining is well positioned for significant growth potential in those metals with our assets. We look forward to seeing the pending assays from Goliath Resources’ Surebet discovery and their new VMS discovery and we are pleased to be enthusiastic shareholders of Goliath with this strategic investment.”* **Golddigger Property** The Golddigger Property is 100% controlled and covers an area of 91,518 hectares in the world-class geological setting of the Eskay Rift, within 3 kilometers of the Red Line in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. This area has hosted some of Canada’s greatest mines including Eskay Creek, Premier and Snip. Other significant and well-known deposits in the Golden Triangle include Brucejack, Copper Canyon, Galore Creek, Granduc, KSM, Red Chris, and Schaft Creek. Goliath controls 56 kilometers of the Red Line which is a geologic contact between Triassic age Stuhini rocks and Jurassic age Hazelton rocks used as key markers when exploring for gold-copper-silver mineralization. The Surebet discovery has exceptional continuity and excellent metallurgy with gold recoveries of 92.2%, with 48.8% of it as free gold from gravity alone at a 327-micrometer crush (no cyanide required to recover the gold). The metallurgy completed to date shows no deleterious elements are present such as mercury or arsenic. The Property is in an excellent location in close proximity to the communities of Alice Arm and Kitsault where there is a permitted mill site on private property. It is situated on tide water with direct barge access to Prince Rupert (190 kilometers via the Observatory inlet/Portland inlet). The town of Kitsault is accessible by road (190 kilometers from Terrace, 300 kilometers from Prince Rupert) and has a barge landing, dock, and infrastructure capable of housing at least 300 people, including high-tension power. Additional infrastructure in the area includes the Dolly Varden Silver Mine Road (only 7 kilometers to the East of the Surebet discovery) with direct road access to Alice Arm barge landing (18 kilometers to the south of the Surebet discovery) and high-tension power (25 kilometers to the east of Surebet discovery). The city of Terrace (population 16,000) provides access to railway, major highways, and airport with supplies (food, fuel, lumber, etc.), while the town of Prince Rupert (population 12,000) is located on the west coast and houses an international container seaport also with direct access to railway and an airport. **About CASERM (Center To Advance The Science Of Exploration To Reclamation In Mining)** Goliath is a paying member and active supporter of CASERM, an organization that represents a collaborative venture between Colorado School of Mines and Virginia Tech aimed at transforming the way that geoscience data is used in the mineral resource industry.

This bill amends the Energy Act of 2020 by expanding the definition of critical minerals to incorporate the Department of Energy’s (DOE) list of critical materials into the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) list of critical minerals. [H.R.8446 - 118th Congress (2023-2024): Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8446?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22H.r.+8446%22%7D&amp;s=4&amp;r=2) ***The legislation has garnered bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats.*** The concept of critical minerals has been emphasized by developed Western nations like the U.S. and the EU. Against the backdrop of increasing localization and regionalization in the mining industry, Western countries view resource security as a key component of national and economic security. The U.S. began establishing a critical minerals list in 2018. # According to the U.S. Energy Act, the DOE’s list includes materials essential for clean energy technology, criteria focused on U.S. economic and national security, significant supply chain risks, and fundamental roles in product manufacturing. Compared to the USGS list, the DOE’s list covers more areas, including materials like copper, ELECTRICAL STEEL, fluorine, silicon, and silicon carbide, which are critical materials but not classified as critical minerals. By broadening the definition, the new bill mandates that the USGS include materials from the DOE’s list within 45 days of their addition to the DOE’s critical materials list. This legislation will next proceed to the Senate for approval. Juan Ciscomani, an Arizona representative and the bill’s sponsor, stated that critical minerals are vital for the U.S. economy, national security, and clean energy technologies. With increasing demand for these strategic resources, the U.S. must ensure a reliable supply. The bill aims to eliminate discrepancies between the USGS and DOE lists and strengthen the domestic supply chain by including copper, electrical steel, silicon, and silicon carbide in the critical minerals list. Adam Estelle, CEO of the Copper Development Association, noted that this vote highlights copper’s crucial role in driving America’s energy future, transportation electrification, job creation, and infrastructure enhancement, marking a significant victory for U.S. manufacturing, the clean energy transition, and national global competitiveness. The bill promotes the standardization of criteria for identifying critical minerals and aims to reduce reliance on foreign imports by encouraging domestic mining, refining, and recycling. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) stated that if the bill becomes law, critical mineral projects, including copper projects, would qualify for the FAST-41 permitting process, making approvals more efficient, predictable, and timely. # *****NIOBIUM'S ROLE IN ELECTRICAL STEEL*** # Niobium (Nb) is a transition metal that is often used as an alloying element in the production of electrical steels, particularly in the manufacture of high-performance steels for electrical applications. The key uses of niobium in electrical steel are as follows: # 1. Improving Magnetic Properties Niobium is used to improve the magnetic properties of electrical steels, especially the **core loss** and **magnetic permeability**. When niobium is added to electrical steel, it enhances the material's ability to carry alternating current with minimal energy loss. This is crucial for applications in transformers, motors, and other electrical devices, where energy efficiency is paramount. # 2. Enhancing Strength and Ductility Niobium enhances the **strength** and **ductility** of electrical steel. By adding niobium to the steel, the grain structure is refined, which improves the mechanical properties of the steel. This results in better formability, allowing for thinner sheets, which is especially important for reducing the size of components like transformer cores and electrical motor laminations. # 3. Grain Refinement Niobium acts as a **grain refiner** in the production of electrical steel. It promotes the formation of fine, uniformly distributed grains, which improves the steel's **magnetic performance**. Smaller grains lead to reduced energy losses (core loss) when the material is exposed to alternating magnetic fields. # 4. Reducing Core Loss Niobium can significantly reduce **core loss**, a critical factor in transformer efficiency. By enhancing the material's microstructure, niobium helps reduce hysteresis and eddy current losses, which are common in electrical steel used for transformer cores and electric motor laminations. # 5. Improving High-Temperature Stability Niobium improves the **high-temperature stability** of electrical steels. This is beneficial for applications where the material may be exposed to high operational temperatures, such as in certain industrial motors and high-power transformers. Niobium's presence helps prevent the degradation of magnetic properties at elevated temperatures. # 6. Better Performance in Laminated Sheets Electrical steels are often produced in **laminated sheets** to reduce energy losses. The addition of niobium contributes to the **interlaminar insulation** and improves the overall performance of the laminated sheets, especially in high-frequency applications. # 7. Improving the Surface Finish Niobium can also help achieve a better **surface finish** in electrical steels, which is important for minimizing losses and improving the electrical efficiency of the components. # Common Applications of Niobium-Alloyed Electrical Steels: * **Transformers:** Niobium helps improve transformer efficiency by reducing core losses. * **Electric Motors:** It is used in motor laminations to enhance efficiency. * **Generators:** Niobium-alloyed steels are used in the production of generator cores. * **Inductors and Chokes:** These components benefit from the improved magnetic properties of niobium-steels. # In summary, Niobium plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of electrical steels, particularly by improving their magnetic properties, strength, ductility, and overall efficiency in electrical applications. Its ability to refine grain structure and reduce energy losses makes it an essential alloying element for high-performance electrical steel used in transformers, motors, and other electrical devices. # OLDIE BUT GOODIE IF YA HAVEN'T SEEN IT AUGUST 2024 OPINION ~Space Saga Continues: Scandium + [Space Saga Continues: Scandium + - MMTA](https://mmta.co.uk/space-saga-continues-scandium/) # Scandium In my last missive, I had a quick look at some of the challenges that have successfully to be met by metals when they are used “in space”. And, prior to that, at a couple of specific metals: beryllium and gallium. I shall, now, turn my attention to scandium, especially in aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) alloys, and why it may be used effectively in the space industry.^(1) **SBIR** A good a place to start, both interesting and fun, is with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme here in the US which encourages “…domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/ R&amp;D) with the potential for commercialization.” Perhaps indicative of the growing recognition of scandium’s (and Al-Sc’s) potential, SBIR (Department of Defense (DoD)/ Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)) recently (on June 12) closed a “solicitation” entitled “Advancing Scandium Use in Metal Alloys for U.S. Weapon System Production and Sustainment” ^(2). To quote further from the solicitation: “Potential DoD applications for Al-Sc alloy include the production and sustainment of *missiles*, aircraft, *space launch vehicles, satellites*, solider systems, military ground vehicles, marine applications, and other weapon systems (e.g., small arms and artillery).”^(3) (*italics mine*) If you think back to some of the challenges faced by “metals in space”, with the characteristics and properties they have, scandium and Al-Sc look pretty useful contenders. As the solicitation states: “Scandium can impart high strength properties to Al alloys which allows for reduced weight designs (compared to traditional Al alloy) and components for a wide range of defense platforms and other military items. Al-Sc alloys exhibit increased resistance to high temperature and corrosion when compared to common Al alloys. Of further interest, is the high weldability of Al-Sc alloy. Alloys with high weldability can reduce manufacturing labor and other costs associated with joining components and structures. Al-Sc alloy can be especially useful when used as a powder or wire in additive manufacturing.”^(4) (I should, however, note that Al-Sc alloys are not new. They have been around a long time now. First recognized in the 1950s^(5), they were developed by scientists in the former USSR, not least for aerospace usage. And, having been used in the MiG 21 and MiG-29, continue, I believe, to be used in some Russian MiG fighters.) **Additive Manufacturing** Whilst the solicitation details quite a number of areas in which the DoD/DLA are particularly interested, for me the one that stands out especially is “additive manufacturing”. As a layperson, simplistically, for me, this last falls under the descriptor “3D printing”. Some six years ago now, reports w...[Content truncated]",Reddit

By John Haughey 12/11/2024 President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 10 pledged to expedite permitting and trim environmental reviews for investors financing large-scale job-creating and power-generating projects. “Any person or company investing One Billion Dollars, Or More, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals. Get Ready to Rock!!!” Trump wrote in a mid-afternoon post on Truth Social. The president-elect did not quantify if he had specific industries in mind in offering expedited “approvals and permits” for $1 billion-plus projects, but permitting reform has been a theme in Congress over the past two years, especially for energy and mining proposals. Among measures that could be adopted before the lame-duck Congress adjourns on Dec. 19 is the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, adopted by the Senate Natural Resources Committee in July without further advance. The measure, co-sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (I-W. Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), streamlines permitting and restricts litigation timelines, among other initiatives. With a Republican trifecta assuming the mantle in Washington in January, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the landmark 1970 law that requires federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews before approving large-scale development and energy projects, is near certain to be revamped. According to a 2020 White House Council on Environmental Quality study, securing final NEPA environmental permits for a project takes an average of 4 1/2 years; for electrical transmission projects, it takes an average of 6 1/2 years. Those timelines stretch into decades when it comes to mining proposals. “Right now, it takes anywhere to 10 to 30 years to build a mine, which is why we don’t have a mining industry in America,” Critical Minerals Institute Director Melissa Sanderson told The Epoch Times, citing “permitting absurdities” as one of the biggest hurdles that startups must overcome in getting projects started and sustaining them before they can get ores, minerals, and fossil fuels to market. Sanderson, a board member with Australia-based American Rare Earths, which is developing several mining projects in Wyoming and Arizona, said slashing permitting timelines and environmental reviews is not merely an economic issue but a matter of national security with China dominating the production and processing of critical minerals needed for semi-conductors and weapons systems. “The government needs to consolidate all of its department [reviews] so the company can present one, and only one, application” when proposing a project, Sanderson said. Right now, if a company wants to build a mine on the nation’s mineral-rich federal lands, it usually must file a permit with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) first. “And they grind along and then you got to go over to” a succession of agencies for further reviews, almost always including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Sanderson said, noting the laborious process can take years and be hamstrung at any point by lawsuits. The federal permitting process is “cumbersome” and disjointed, she said. “Each agency has its own procedure and process,” and it is step-by-step sequential instead of simultaneous, she said. Ideally, she said, every agency “gets one bite at the apple” in one comprehensive 90-day review and then the applicant has 90 days to respond to any issues cited in the permit and environmental reviews. The 180-day permit review kicks off “a two-year clock” in which all parties resolve issues, she said. If there’s no agency decision at the end of two years, “the project is considered to be approved” and it can begin. That same timeline applies to litigation, requiring lawsuits to be filed no later than two years after a permit is filed and resolved no later than four years from that date, Sanderson said. “If a dozen nonprofits and two tribes have issues, they have to come together and present one consolidated complaint that addresses their concerns,” she said. Without such permitting and litigation timelines and consolidations, the private investment needed to fuel the nation’s domestic energy production will be difficult to secure, Sanderson said. Investors aren’t going to put their money into something that could take decades to develop, if at all, she said. “Ten to 30 years? Okay, you call me when you’re in production, buddy,” she said There’s no reason this can’t happen, Sanderson said, noting “Australia has cut it down to two years. For America to do it in four years would be incredible.” She cited Rio Tinto’s Resolution copper project in Arizona as an example. “Twenty years of pouring money into the ground and they still don’t have a mine,” she said. Trump’s pledge to streamline permitting is a keystone in his “Drill, baby, drill” campaign pitch to deregulate energy production and domestically source key minerals and ores. “Getting permit reform is the number one priority the federal government should be focused on,” Sanderson said. “Everybody has got to work together in a concerted way.” Meanwhile, environmental groups opposed the proposal, suggesting it was illegal and a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, a 54-year-old law that requires federal agencies to study the potential environmental impact of proposed actions and consider alternatives. Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group, said the plan involved Trump “offering to sell out America to the highest corporate bidder.” She said it was another example of Trump “putting special interests and corporate polluters in the driver’s seat, which would result in more pollution, higher costs and fewer energy choices for the American people.” Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, another environmental group, also expressed concern over the pledge. “There’s a reason Congress requires the government to take a hard look at community impacts to make sure we don’t greenlight projects that do more harm than good,” Adams said.

It's an entirely different philosophy. The majority of their wealth would be tied into real estate instead which is why many Chinese have become wealthy the past decade with a growing demand in urbanized housing. Also, the government has an insane amount of control in the Chinese equity markets. What is happening to BABA right now is expected of the Chinese government to native Chinese individuals. There's a reason why BABA and other large Asian companies choose to list under the U.S. and Hong Kong stock exchanges instead. Because it's much easier to raise the capital they need since the financial capacity of Hong Kong and the United States are more geared towards the capital market. Chinese regulations to go public is very strict and highly regulated. However, there is a lot of fraud involved once the company goes public such as insider trading and falsified statements. There is still a huge mistrust in Chinese equities not just for Americans but the Chinese as well. To sum it up, the equity market in China is not heavily emphasized as much as it is in the USA.

The United States first opened its Bureau of Mines in 1910 to coordinate minerals security needs. It was closed in 1996. In many ways, the U.S. government rapidly decelerated its efforts over the subsequent two decades. However, over the last seven years, the United States realized its reliance on China for critical minerals posed serious risks to its national and energy security alongside its economic competitiveness and prosperity. In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, intending to improve the management of critical minerals needed for economic prosperity and energy security. In 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14017, which led to a review of U.S. critical mineral and material supply chain vulnerabilities. The assessment released by the Biden administration discovered that the overreliance on adversarial countries posed a threat to national and economic security. The Biden administration and Congress advanced important efforts to address these vulnerabilities, including through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CHIPS and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Minerals Security Partnership, and increased capitalization of the Defense Production Act. However, the United States remains highly reliant on China given its decades-long advantage. With a new administration and Congress taking office in January 2025, the Critical Minerals Security Program at CSIS has created seven recommendations for accelerating efforts to create resilient minerals supply chains and safeguard U.S. interests. The current focus of both the U.S. government and industry is on the extent to which tariffs will be used to achieve the overarching objective. The reality is that a combination of sticks and carrots will be required. Permitting reform and subsidies can help build domestic production and processing capabilities. Overusing tariffs can have a negative impact. For commodities that the United States has limited or no supply of or is at early-stage development, imposing high tariffs can have two consequences: (1) it can make goods too expensive for end users to purchase, leading to a chokehold on important U.S. industries and jobs central to economic prosperity and national security, and (2) high tariffs on mineral imports can drive producing countries to export elsewhere (likely China)—which could strengthen China’s dominant position in minerals supply chains. Incentives to invest domestically and in allied countries will be an important carrot to stimulate mineral production and processing. Without this investment, building resilient supply chains will be nearly impossible. # Recommendation 1: Create a Renewed Bureau of Mines to Expand Domestic Mining Capabilities Building a new mine in the United States takes an average of [29 years](https://www.eenews.net/articles/us-mine-development-among-worlds-slowest-report-finds/)**—**the second longest in the world. Obtaining [permission](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106395.pdf) to operate a mine in the United States today involves securing federal, state, and local permits, as well as ensuring compliance with redundant regulations. A project can require up to [30 permits](https://natlawreview.com/article/permitting-reform-united-states#google_vignette), many of which are duplicative. The specific permits needed vary depending on the mine’s location and its proposed operations. Streamlining permits has received bipartisan federal support in both the Trump and Biden administrations. President Trump’s [Executive Order 13953](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-10-05/pdf/2020-22064.pdf) directed agency heads: “As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits and the completion of projects in connection with expanding and protecting the domestic supply chain for minerals.” The Biden administration kept this executive order. The U.S. [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-16-165) noted that ineffective government coordination can delay federal permitting by up to three years. Centralizing government support for permitting the creation of a mine through a Bureau of Mines can accelerate permitting and incentivize domestic mine development. [Canada and Australia](https://mineralsmakelife.org/blog/us-lags-in-mine-development/) have agencies that oversee mine development. Establishing a bureau could be done through an executive order or Congress. There has been bipartisan congressional support for streamlining permitting. In 2024, Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced the [Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4753/text) to streamline permitting. The legislation would simplify the long and expensive process of building mines, while still protecting the environment and surrounding communities. # Recommendation 2: Develop Incentives to Safeguard U.S. Industries Building mining and processing capabilities is capital-intensive. Current market conditions are a deterrent to building capabilities**—**lithium, cobalt, and nickel prices are at [multi-year lows](https://www.csis.org/analysis/drivers-base-metals-price-volatility). The IRA sought to provide incentives for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, through provisions such as the [Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x), which established mineral sourcing requirements from the United States and countries it has a free trade agreement with (FTA). However, not all mineral-intensive industries received incentives. The [CHIPS and Science Act of 2022](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip) provided $280 billion for advanced chip manufacturing. Yet, it only included support for chip manufacturing, packaging, and workforce development and provided no support for securing mineral inputs. This poses a significant threat. The United States is highly reliant and dependent on China and Russia for four minerals vital to semiconductor production**—**germanium, gallium, palladium, and polysilicon. Incentives are also needed for the minerals required for the defense industry, including aluminum, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, indium, manganese, nickel, rare earths, tantalum, titanium, and tungsten. The United States is highly reliant on Chinese firms for sourcing a number of these commodities. Incentives for the automotive industry remain important to protect domestic firms and U.S. jobs. In June 2024, automotive manufacturing jobs reached a [34-year high](https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/08/21/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-auto-manufacturing-jobs-at-34-year-peak/) in the United States—the highest since 1990. The IRA drove the development of a labor-intensive “Battery Belt” of factories in the Southeast. It also mobilized $114 billion in private-sector EV-related investments that are forecasted to create [99,600 jobs](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-auto-manufacturing-jobs-34-year-peak#:~:text=In%20the%20automotive%20sector%2C%20the,a%20significant%20source%20of%20employment.). Terminating incentives to the domestic automotive sector will generate negative economic consequences—including China further outpacing the United States by creating a cost-competitive EV industry that it can export worldwide, falling behind on research and development, and job losses. # Recommendation 3: Expand Domestic Capabilities while Bolstering Strategic International Partnerships At a recent CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program roundtable, a former U.S. ambassador noted, “Processing is often commercially stupid but strategically important for U.S. interests.” Processing profit margins are often [quite low](https://ecfr.eu/publication/material-world-how-europe-can-compete-with-china-in-the-race-for-africas-critical-minerals/) and sometimes even unprofitable. However, without financial support to the private sector to build domestic capabilities, China will continue its processing dominance, leaving the United States vulnerable to China’s more frequent use of export restrictions. Although [China](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x) produces just 10 percent of the world’s cobalt, lithium, and nickel, it imports vast quantities allowing it to process 60–90 percent of the global supply of these base metals. These processing capabilities were built using state support. The United States has made noteworthy progress in building domestic midstream capacity—over the last four years, it has disbursed over $300 million to build domestic rare earth processing capabilities through the Defense Production Act. However, given that the United States has roughly 1.3 percent of the world’s rare earths, deploying incentives for rare earth mining projects in Brazil and Vietnam, which cumulatively hold [37 percent](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means) of the world’s reserves, will be vital to pr...[Content truncated]",Reddit

Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear) I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours) Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere. Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc. Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

US futures are up small. Nothing major occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT (http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers (both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be important too. * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb (8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC, VRNT after the close). * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP. Treasuries are pretty flat. * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks, media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19. * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan (TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China (SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI +0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%, Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77% vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%. #US macro update * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18 EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs (Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which starts Thurs morning 4/13). #Top Headlines for Tuesday * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels “burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 – “tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15% corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are talking about &gt;20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8 * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget; Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post. http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment – the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by automation and increased nat. gas demand.

648,Global,2024-07,"I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket after traders rotate out of Mag7 and into IWM. Here's where they are positioned now, post CPI. -ANALYSIS: **IWM up again in premarket. Is at the 52w high resistance, after big breakout. Calls build on 215 and 220 in the positioning data. If we can hold this 211.88 52w high level, we head higher to 215+.** [https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25](https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25) **Similarly Traders bet on return to 52w highs on TNA. Leveraged small caps so beware of that.** [https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE](https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE) **I think the IWM, small cap buy case is strong. I was in from before CPI as I thought it was too bearish and would see squeeze. But I think CPI and unemployment data is now pointing to sept rate cut. I think Trump winning is bullish for Small caps too. I think there's reasons there for IWM to run** **VIX: Slight spike yesterday, but traders are still V short volatility, with vix in contango. V much skewed to ITM puts. Traders will try to crush VIX again.** [https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M](https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M) Dow Jones positioning also looks bullish, with my target at 40k. **Rotation we saw yesterday is normal given soft inflation print, which makes chance of rate cuts more likely. Hence traders rotated from mag7 into interest rate sensitive IWM. But there's no panic in markets, credit default swaps plunged, hence conditions bullish Traders will buy back Mag7 too soon.** Some MAG7 more bullish than others. MSFT&lt; AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL the most bullish. NVDA somewhat. TSLA less so, as we see traders take profits. Its normal though given they had the robotaxi news, not just rotation. GOLD AND OIL POSITIONING ARE BULLISH AFTER CPI. DATA LEDE: CHINA BALANCE OF TRADE data showed stronger than expected exports, up 8.6% vs 8% expected. Stronger global demand. However, still weak domestic demand, as imports fell -2.3% vs 2.8% expected. Trade surplus highest since 1990 German wholesale prices come in at -0.3% MOM vs 0.2% expected. US PPI coming premarket. US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Numbers and Inflation expectation numbers after market opens. YESTERDAY CPI REVIEW: Overall a v bullish CPI print, which supports September cut imo. This coupled with labour market data means Fed shouldn’t hesitate to cut rates. Lowest Y/Y CPI print since March 2021 First M/M decrease since May 2020. Down -0.1% vs expectation of 0.1% increase. Shelter component had smallest increase since Aug 2021 We saw a big fall in airline fares, down 5%, and we saw a big drop in used car prices. The drop in airline fares was corroborated by Delta airline earnings. MARKETS: WE SAW PROFIT TAKING ON SPX AND NASDAQ YESTERDAY AS TRADERS ROTATED INTO SMALL CAPS WHICH HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. SPX sold off form 5640 to 5577, before recovering slightly. Is currently trading at 5592. Just lost the gains from Wednesdays move. NASDAQ: Bigger sell off, as is more heavily weighted to the Mag7, which saw the most selling. Dropped from 20,700 to 20200. Flat here. Dow Jones: Moving higher, confirmed breakout, moved up to 39,800. Next target looks like 40k GER40: European markets higher after soft CPI yesterday. Chinese market higher from the added restrictions on short selling which is an artificial support of the HKG market, also following US CPI hence supporting lower rates in US which helps chinese exports. Nikkei drops after hitting ATH earlier in the week. GOLD moving higher above 2400 after soft CPI Oil recovering, positioning improving after Dollar weakness from CPI lead to recovery. VIX - jumped yesterday, but traders still v short on vix, hence we probably see sell off again. EARNINGS: JPM EPS of 4.4 vs estimate of 4.28. Adjusted revenue of 50.99B vs 50.21B estimate. Deposits were lower than expected Metrics - Net charge offs of 2.231 beat 2.265B Tangible Book value per share was 92.77 vs 91.45 EST.

Said expectations for core auto business are deteriorating. Premium is v big due to AI enthusiasm. AI investment though is costly and payoff is long dated. If enthusiasm for AI dwindles for Tesla, will see a lot of downside. TSLA - unveils new model 3 long range variant, with 7500 tax credit. MSFT - Citi reiterates buy rating, PT 520. Said that it remains preferred generative AI partners among CIOs, far ahead of AMZN and GOOGL. 71% of CIOs expect more funding for GenAI projects, and will increase spend on gene by 13% over next 12 months. AMZN - more planned selling by Bezos yesterday, selling 420M worth of shares. AAPL - BoA raises PT of Apple to 256 from 230. Raised PT driven by more confidence in multi year iPhone upgrade cycle.

As such, new candidate would be starting with 0 a few months before the election, v dangerous. Feds Goolsbee - doesnt feel like beginning of recession. Labour market cooling but still strong.

650,Global,2021-02,"Random Stonk of the Week - Empired (EPD)-So, let's try it - as a fair few people indicated they'd be keen, I'll be picking a random ASX stock that I've (*personally*, yes I'm aware it may have been posted here at some point in history) never seen discussed on this sub - and that I do NOT hold - to discuss per week. This is for us all to have a look at what it does, some of their financials, and in the end discuss whether or not we'd buy into it. As /u/Phishbaron put it, think of it as a sort of ""group DD"" in which we pool our 5 collective braincells together and evaluate the chosen company. The main purpose being to add some more variety in tickers to all the standard meme stocks we see pumped day in and day out, and hopefully discover some hidden gems - or at least, less stinky forms of dogshit. The only other criteria is that the share price has to be under $2. Let's give this a try boyos: # Random ASX Stonk of the Week - Week 1: **Company name:** Empired Ltd **Ticker:** EPD **Industry:** Information Technology **Headquarters:** Perth **Market cap:** $120m **Current share price:** $0.75 **P/E ratio:** 10.2 **1-year Performance:** \+111.27% **What they do, smoothbrain version:** nerds who charge ridiculous prices to do computer shit for companies &amp; governments **What they say they do, wanky version:** *""We help you reimagine, transform and evolve for your best possible future, connected and enabled by technology.""* 🍆👋 **What they do, actual version:** Empired are a Sydney-based B2B IT ""integration services"" company that help their clients ""go digital"" in a wholistic way, e.g: switching them over to cloud-based systems, improving digital security, putting in automation, and helping them convert to ""agile"" work approaches. Their revenue comes solely from Australia/NZ, and a big chunk of that is from contracts signed in Western Australia recently. **What looks good:** * Their last quarterly update was very impressive dollar-wise. While they only recorded a 7% increase in revenue, they managed to achieve a H1 Net profit after tax of $7.7m (up 284%) * Operating cash flow of $17.5m, up 59.3% * Good overall share price growth (100+%) for a company with a P/E ratio of just over 10 * Have contracts with some big bois out there, including Rio Tinto, the government, etc. These are multi-year so provide over 50% of revenue as recurring * Decided to pay a (small) dividend for the first time, and aiming for a bigger one moving forward * Healthy debt to equity ratio (e.g, not much debt) * Their report designs are slick &amp; make something like Brainchip's look like they were made by a blind toddler whose Microsoft Office subscription is about to expire * Their year on year financials are generally trending up YOY **What doesn't look good:** * Shitty name that I'm not sure how to pronounce. Is it ""Empire-d"" as in ""Empired Strikes Back"", or ""Empi-red"", as in the colour of my portfolio? * JobKeeper played a role in pumping up their numbers * Seems to be overly contract-dependent on several large clients for revenue... AVA flashbacks, anyone? * Management only own about 10% of the shares on issue, not a particularly high percentage * While their revenue is trending up YOY, it's not substantially so * May be a beneficiary from the Covid-19 ""everyone panic cause we need the tech to be able to go digital/work from home better"" boom **Conclusion:** EPD are coming off some pretty strong tailwinds that have benefitted a lot of stocks across the whole ASX. They look like one of the more fundamentally solid of the listed tech companies in terms of profitability, however.

651,Global,2025-08,"Rock Solid Strategy: Rio Tinto’s Bold New Structure-Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/rock-solid-strategy-rio-tinto-s-bold-new-structure](https://www.juniorstocks.com/rock-solid-strategy-rio-tinto-s-bold-new-structure) Rio Tinto streamlines operations into three core divisions and refreshes its executive team in a bold bid to unlock long-term growth and shareholder returns. https://preview.redd.it/p5v6491pzllf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c4a4ea16ffa8c105c019078e2d5769952b31a3 Rio Tinto has entered a new phase in its long corporate history, unveiling a sweeping reorganization of its operating model and executive leadership team. Effective immediately, the mining giant will be streamlined into three world-class product groups: Iron Ore, Aluminium &amp; Lithium, and Copper. This strategic pivot is designed to sharpen accountability, maximize efficiencies, and accelerate shareholder returns. Chief Executive Simon Trott described the changes as a turning point, underscoring the company’s mission to marry operational excellence with safe, sustainable, and profitable growth. The new structure, he said, will ensure Rio Tinto concentrates resources where they can deliver the greatest value while staying aligned with the global energy transition and long-term demand for critical minerals. **Iron Ore Consolidation** Iron Ore remains the backbone of Rio Tinto, and under the new model all of the company’s iron ore operations will be unified. This includes the powerhouse Pilbara mines in Western Australia, the Iron Ore Company of Canada, and, upon completion, the Simandou project in Guinea. Matthew Holcz has been appointed Chief Executive of the Iron Ore group, bringing over two decades of experience and leadership rooted in both international operations and the Pilbara heartland. This consolidation is expected to unlock synergies across safety practices, technology deployment, and operational know-how. For shareholders, it means the proven strength of Rio’s established operations will be coupled with the long-term growth potential of Simandou, one of the world’s richest undeveloped iron ore deposits. **Aluminium and Lithium Integration** Rio Tinto is also folding its Lithium business into the Aluminium portfolio, creating a more streamlined division under the leadership of Jérôme Pécresse. The new Aluminium &amp; Lithium group will consist of Atlantic Operations Aluminium, Pacific Operations Aluminium, and Lithium. The rationale is straightforward: combine downstream exposure and processing capability while leveraging Rio’s Safe Production System, which has already driven efficiency gains in Aluminium. Lithium, often called the “white gold” of the energy transition, sits at the heart of global electrification. By placing it alongside Aluminium, a cornerstone material for transportation and energy infrastructure, Rio is positioning itself to benefit from surging demand in both markets. **Copper Positioned for Energy Transition** Copper, led by Katie Jackson, remains a central pillar of Rio Tinto’s growth story. Copper demand is soaring globally due to its role in renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and modern infrastructure. Jackson’s mandate is to ramp up production at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, stabilize Kennecott in the United States, and advance strategic projects like Resolution in Arizona and Nuevo Cobre in Chile. The division’s forward-looking strategy cements Rio’s position as a critical supplier to the global energy transition, making Copper not just a business unit but a growth engine for the company’s future. **Leadership Changes and Transitions** The restructuring brings both new appointments and departures. Longtime Rio veteran Sinead Kaufman will step down at the end of October after nearly three decades of service, a career marked by leadership in coal divestment and the establishment of lithium operations. Chief Executive Australia, Kellie Parker, will also transition out of her role, with external relations responsibilities moving to a newly created head of Australia position. Simon Trott paid tribute to both leaders, highlighting their transformational contributions during critical phases in Rio’s corporate evolution. **A Sharper Focus on Shareholder Value** Trott’s message is clear: Rio Tinto is doubling down on disciplined capital deployment, operational excellence, and long-term value creation. The streamlined model is designed to push decision-making closer to the core of operations, while enhancing accountability and responsiveness to global market shifts. Rio’s resilience in recent years, despite fluctuating commodity prices and global uncertainty, has set the stage for this transformation. With mid-term production growth targets on track, the company is now positioning itself to deliver stronger returns by focusing squarely on its most compelling opportunities. **The Executive Committee Going Forward** The updated executive committee reflects a balance of deep operational experience and global perspective. Alongside Trott, the team includes Bold Baatar as Chief Commercial Officer, Georgie Bezette as Chief People Officer, Peter Cunningham as Chief Financial Officer, Mark Davies as Chief Technical Officer, Isabelle Deschamps as Chief Legal, Governance and Corporate Affairs Officer, Matthew Holcz as Chief Executive of Iron Ore, Katie Jackson as Chief Executive of Copper, and Jérôme Pécresse as Chief Executive of Aluminium &amp; Lithium. This group will now steer Rio Tinto through its next chapter, navigating both the challenges and the vast opportunities embedded in the global demand for critical minerals. **Conclusion** Rio Tinto’s reorganization is more than an internal reshuffle. It is a statement of intent from one of the world’s largest mining companies. By sharpening its focus on Iron Ore, Aluminium &amp; Lithium, and Copper, Rio is betting big on the commodities that will define the global economy for decades to come. With a refreshed executive team, a disciplined capital strategy, and a commitment to safety and sustainability, Rio is laying the foundation for a new era of growth and value creation. The changes may be immediate, but their impact will play out over years as Rio seeks to align its vast resources with the future needs of the world. For investors, the message is unmistakable: Rio Tinto is streamlining to scale new heights in shareholder value.",Reddit
652,Global,2024-07,"Rio Tinto Graduate Program Review-**More graduates than senior developers** Because there are so many people who lack experience, the work suffers. Depending on your luck, you may not have a senior to work with you for your first 3 months, which will be spent on a non business value electronic greeting/networking/clubs/hobbies system. Nobody uses these systems and it exists just to keep you busy. Eventually you should be put into a proper development team, like your luckier peers. However the quality of your development lead and scrum master may vary. Some will never interact with you at all, and expect you to resolve all your work yourself. Production incidents will occur and your scrum master will reprioritize your work, only to yell at you when your original work is not completed by the original deadline. This abuse extends beyond juniors, extending towards seniors, where the entire team is too afraid to call out abuse, as they too have been abuse for raising issues. **Sexual assault towards younger women** If you're a young girl, expect sexual assault. Juniors and seniors will touch you without consent. If you raise this with management, they will say, ""this is due to cultural differences and you should be more inclusive"". I know 5 cases just within our department within the last 2 months. You're not any safer in a city office than you are on site. **Not enough work** There is a lot of work, however nobody is willing to pay for it. Most of this work is outside the capabilities of a junior too. If you shomehow do manage to go onto a product, hope your lead developer is helpful. Currently we have a bunch of juniors and seniors who mess around as they have no work to do. One guy just plays chess on his phone for most of the day while he waits for his project allocation. **Forced into roles you lack training for** Non programmers are forced to do programming, despite hiring making it clear you will not be in a software development role. When raising the issue with management, they will tell you to ""keep an open mind"". **Closing thoughts** If you somehow manage to withstand all this, the money is very good, and there are opportunities to learn cool things. You just need to be proactive to find these opportunities. Eventually however you will need to switch departments or companies to expand your skill set. Staying here long term as a software developer is career suicide, as you don't work on complex tasks or with new technology.",Reddit

The Electrical Trades Union applied for orders against BHP late last week on behalf of about 170 rail maintenance workers to get the mining giant to the bargaining table on grounds that most workers want an agreement. The Fair Work Commission legal action was followed by about 60 high-voltage workers, who maintain power lines for BHP mine sites and its mining town, endorsing claims on Monday for pay rises of 4.5 per cent a year over four years to lift base rates to $249,000 by 2028. The claims are part of a broader push to reunionise the Pilbara for the first time in 30 years. Mining giants are pushing back with legal action and promises of pay rises averaging $25,000 to ward off unions. So far, BHP is the only miner in the Pilbara that has been forced to bargain. But what emerges from its negotiations is expected to ramp up pressure on the hardline Rio Tinto, which is fighting unionisation efforts tooth and nail.",Reddit

That one for me was Copper Quest Exploration (CSE: CQX, OTC: IMIMF). I have witnessed numerous explorers attempt to ride the macro wave of copper. This one had a distinct feel. Actual land. Actual intercepts. Actual team. And now, actual U.S. expansion. Earlier this year, they rebranded themselves as Copper Quest instead of Interra Copper. It went beyond simple branding. It truly was a change. Behind the scenes, they were accumulating a portfolio of significant porphyry projects in British Columbia, totaling over 40,000 hectares spread across four distinct properties. Then they agreed to a high-grade copper-gold porphyry project in the United States. I've seen juniors waste money chasing irregularities. Drill data is real in CQX. They found 195 m of 0.466% Cu in one of their holes at the Stars project. It is an appropriate porphyry intercept. Stars sit next to Stellar. It has mapped mineralization on the surface and a clean magnetic anomaly, but it hasn't been drilled yet. ArcWest's Rip earn-in already displays a number of porphyry systems. Next is Thane, a district-scale property spanning 20,658 hectares and situated between two significant mines, Mt. Milligan and Kemess. One of these could make a difference. When combined, they resemble a mid-tier portfolio's micro-cap counterpart. Their entry into the U.S. was the main factor that convinced me to purchase 100,000 shares. They agreed to buy a copper-gold porphyry project in June after historic surface samples revealed 3.00% Cu, 0.8 g/t Au, and 25 g/t Ag. very close to the surface. within a Tier 1 jurisdiction. Additionally, the local technical staff is remaining on board. This is not a play about hoping and praying. They are filling the gap with actual data and operational support. And the individuals in charge of this show? That was the clincher. The Aurelian team, which sold for more than $1 billion, included CEO Brian Thurston. Mike Ciricillo oversaw Glencore's whole copper business worldwide. Rich Leveille held senior positions at Phelps Dodge, Rio Tinto, and Freeport. Trevali was completely constructed by Mark Cruise.

In their first season back, Utah’s front office tried to create a home town feel by hiring former Royals player Amy Rodriguez (ARod) as Head Coach and building a roster filled with local college talent. About 4 games into the season, Utah continued to build its roster with 3 new signings: Macey Fraser (NZ, former club Wellington Phoenix FC), Amandine Henry (FR, former club Angel City FC), and Ana Tejada (ESP, former club Real Sociedad). Fraser only made 4 appearances for the club with a consistent ankle injury and an extended excused absence for most of the season. While Henry brought noticeable experience and confidence to the pitch, she was unable to secure a consistent starting role for the team. Last but not least, Tejada quickly worked her way into the starting 11 as a defensive mid. After 11 matches leaving the Royals with 1 win, 9 losses, and 1 tie, ARod was fired and newly appointed Assistant Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets was promoted to interim head coach. The team’s Goalkeeping coach was also fired and the team President was reassigned to a different project. While many fans felt outraged at the sudden sacking of ARod, especially because it came right after a much improved look with the Royals tying the Portland Thorns, many have come to accept that this was the right move. Inside sources also indicate that Coenraets actually acted as head coach at that Portland game (his lineup, his strategy). Shortly after the big staffing moves, the league entered international break, and Utah made some major roster changes that enabled them to show strong in the Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup in which Utah settled at the top of their group and was one slot away from the finals. Here is a summary of the roster changes made during international break: [Photo: https:\/\/www.kget.com\/sports\/ap-japan-beats-u-s-2-1-for-shebelieves-cup-womens-soccer-title\/](https://preview.redd.it/oigjk2wmyjme1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32e4f61bbfe0a0cc37d5db21503325a28a5f5e8) **Mina Tanaka**, FW (JPN, former club INAC Kobe Leonessa) * Influence: As a seasoned international player, Tanaka was consistently able to help Utah transition into more favorable offensive positions.

Her coordination between the back line and the forwards created more scoring opportunities resulting in 3 assists and 2 goals over 10 games. Zornoza started for all 10 of her appearances, and was named to the NWSL Best XI of the Month for October/November 2024.

Another seasoned international player for the Royals coming in making big moves, including the Club’s first hat trick and the first hat trick of the 2024 NWSL season. With 4 goals in 9 games, Lacasse became the Royals’ top scorer for the season. In her 9th appearance for the Royals, Lacasse suffered a devastating ACL rupture and MCL sprain, moving her to the season-ending injury list. Lacasse will continue her recovery and is expected to miss a significant portion (if not all) of the 2025 season. **Other Major Injuries** * **Imani Dorsey**, DF, ruptured achilles in the 2nd game of the season * **Lauren Flynn**, DF, bilateral compartment syndrome in lower legs **Standout Players** [Photo: https:\/\/www.rsl.com\/utahroyals\/players\/mandy-haught\/](https://preview.redd.it/0umreb7yzjme1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067b14a2f6675ba2df27c8c0747e2a09ba256ffe) **1.

663,Global,2025-08,"Yukon or Bust: Rick Rule’s Latest Investment Thesis-Original Article: [https://www.juniorstocks.com/yukon-or-bust-rick-rule-s-latest-investment-thesis](https://www.juniorstocks.com/yukon-or-bust-rick-rule-s-latest-investment-thesis) Frontier fortunes and investor risks collide in Canada’s untamed Yukon, where Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter dissects discovery, disaster, and opportunity. https://preview.redd.it/gt7hxfnwezlf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03cedca5cd4af2b846f592212e1d2a12b7869b54 The Yukon is a land of staggering contrasts, where towering peaks, rolling rivers, and dense pine forests hide an immense geological prize. For investors, this northern expanse of Canada represents both untapped promise and sobering cautionary tales. In his latest Rule Investment Newsletter, Rick Rule reminds readers why the Yukon has captivated explorers for generations and why disciplined investors should pay attention to the territory’s unfolding story. **The Allure of Untapped Riches** Yukon remains one of the least explored mining jurisdictions in the world. This is no small fact in an age when new large-scale discoveries are becoming rare. Over 20 million ounces of gold have been defined in a narrow stretch of the Tombstone Belt, placing the region alongside some of the world’s most promising exploration fronts. Banyan Gold and Snowline Gold alone have outlined deposits exceeding seven million ounces each, proof that Yukon can host not just one but several district-scale systems. Investors are drawn to the scale. The idea that multiple five-million-ounce discoveries may lie hidden beneath Yukon’s rugged surface is intoxicating for majors searching for multi-decade projects. Rick Rule emphasizes that scarcity drives value. The global mining industry is desperate for new deposits, and Yukon continues to deliver. **The Whiplash of Investor Sentiment** But the path is never smooth. The bankruptcy of Victoria Gold following the heap leach failure at its Eagle mine in 2024 rattled investor confidence. Overnight, explorers across the territory saw their valuations collapse, not because of their own technical failings but because markets feared Yukon itself might be unworkable. Rule notes this cycle of euphoria and despair is the very fabric of resource investing. Weak hands exit in panic while disciplined capital waits patiently for clarity. The report into Eagle’s collapse concluded that heap leaching was not fundamentally flawed, but poorly executed. That distinction matters. Banyan’s shift toward mill-based processing, focusing on higher-grade zones at Aurmac, was partly informed by this lesson. For investors, the rebound in Yukon explorer share prices after the initial shock illustrates a deeper truth: geology doesn’t change, sentiment does. **Capital Flows Return** Despite the turbulence, capital is flowing back into the territory. Yukon explorers raised nearly C$200 million in 2024 and are on track to match that pace this year. Rule’s own portfolio has benefitted. Rackla Metals and Sitka Gold have soared more than 400 percent in the past twelve months, a testament to the market’s hunger for early-stage discovery potential. Majors are circling. B2Gold’s stake in Snowline, Agnico Eagle’s position in White Gold, and Rio Tinto’s strategic interest in Western Copper &amp; Gold demonstrate that the big players still view Yukon as fertile hunting ground. Yet Rule cautions that not every corporate investment turns into a mine. Goldcorp’s much-hyped acquisition of Kaminak’s Coffee project still sits undeveloped under Newmont’s ownership, now up for sale. Investors, Rule advises, must separate geological reality from market mythology. **The Standout Projects** Several companies emerge as central characters in Yukon’s investment story. Banyan Gold’s Aurmac, with 7.7 million ounces outlined, is pushing toward a mill-based PEA that could deliver 300,000 ounces of annual production. Snowline’s Valley deposit, with its high grades and extraordinary intercepts, is already being spoken of as one of Canada’s largest future mines. Rackla Metals is testing whether the Tombstone Belt’s golden reach stretches into the Northwest Territories. Sitka Gold, through aggressive drilling, is assembling a land package that could define a new district. Fireweed Metals, armed with U.S. Department of Defense funding, is pushing tungsten and zinc into the spotlight at Mactung and Macpass. Gladiator Metals is reviving Whitehorse’s forgotten copper belt. Western Copper’s Casino project, meanwhile, remains a giant waiting for infrastructure and cheap power to make it viable. Rule is clear that scale, metallurgy, and location matter most. Projects with infrastructure advantages, high-grade cores, and district potential will draw the majors when consolidation sweeps through. **The Infrastructure Dilemma** Infrastructure is Yukon’s Achilles heel. Power shortages and road access remain critical obstacles. The territory’s hydro grid is stretched thin, forcing both Snowline and Banyan to model diesel-powered operations. Western Copper plans to use LNG for Casino, but the economics remain marginal compared to the cheap, clean power majors demand. Ottawa’s pledge to study a Yukon–British Columbia grid intertie is welcome, but billions of dollars and years of negotiation stand in the way. Rule’s message is blunt: geology alone does not make a mine. Without roads, power, and First Nations alignment, even the richest deposits can languish. Investors must weigh these realities carefully. **The Shadow of Victoria Gold** Victoria’s downfall casts a long shadow. Once Yukon’s flagship producer, the company’s bankruptcy underscores both the risks and the stakes. Its Eagle mine, along with the Raven deposit and Brewery Creek, are now up for grabs through PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Whoever takes control will instantly become Yukon’s dominant player, with the power to reshape sentiment across the territory. Rule argues that if a deep-pocketed major steps in, it will be a vote of confidence in Yukon that lifts all boats. The government has every incentive to make this happen. With Victoria gone, Yukon has lost its largest taxpayer. Federal transfers keep the territory afloat, but long-term sustainability requires mining revenues. A successful sale of Eagle would not only restore production but also reassure global investors that Yukon is open for business. **Rick Rule’s Yukon Thesis** Rick Rule has spent a career navigating the booms and busts of resource investing. His Yukon thesis distills to a simple idea: the territory is a frontier with world-class potential, but only disciplined investors will thrive. Those who buy when fear dominates, and sell when euphoria peaks, will capture the asymmetric rewards. Projects like Snowline, Banyan, Rackla, and Sitka may not all succeed, but even one more world-class discovery could be transformative. Yukon, he argues, is not just a bet on geology but on human resilience, capital discipline, and the slow grind of infrastructure development. For investors willing to stomach volatility, it is precisely the kind of jurisdiction where fortunes are made. **Conclusion** The Yukon story is still being written. It is a place of giants and ghosts, of billion-dollar valuations and sudden bankruptcies, of soaring drill intercepts and stubborn logistical challenges. Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter paints a vivid picture of both promise and peril. For those who can navigate sentiment swings and keep their eyes on the rocks beneath the tundra, Yukon remains one of the most compelling frontier plays on the planet.",Reddit

You’ve got to be in it to win it. Here are some of the little-known stocks that Australia’s wealthy elite are dabbling in. # Gina Rinehart **Best known for: Hancock Prospecting** **Also has shares in: Ballard Mining** Gina Rinehart (right) owns stocks in plenty of Australian miners.

The Hancock holdings also include shares in US-listed stocks such as Tesla, Fox and Trump Media. Rinehart is a noted fan of US President Donald Trump. Closer to home, Hancock has emerged as a major shareholder in newly listed gold explorer Ballard Mining, which has been spun out of ASX-listed Delta Lithium – Delta also counts Hancock as a shareholder. Ballard raised $30m to pay for a 130,000m drilling campaign at Mount Ida, in Western Australia’s Goldfields. It’s worth just $69m, with a return of just 2.7 per cent so far this year. Hancock owns 6.19 per cent. # Gerry Harvey **Best known for: Harvey Norman** **Also has shares in: Briscoe Group** Gerry Harvey is the face of Harvey Norman.

His investment company has also popped up on the share register of RAS, which provides horse racing data services. Last year, RAS struck a deal with Ed Craven’s [Stake.com](http://Stake.com) to provide racing data, a trading management platform, risk management services and customer and generosity management tools for Stake’s new horse racing betting business. The share price fell late last year but has recovered and is up 10 per cent since January (but over a year is down 24.6 per cent). # Chris Morris **Best known for: Computershare** **Also has shares in: Seagate Technology** Chris Morris is best known for Computershare. But he owns shares in Seagate Technologies as well. Picture: Evan Morgan Morris started share registry services firm Computershare in 1978 and built it into an ASX-listed giant. It is worth $23.2bn, and has delivered a 59 per cent return for investors over the past year. Morris maintains a large shareholding in the business and has extensive Queensland tourism assets, including the Townsville casino and the five-star Orpheus Island Lodge. He also has shares in US data storage company Seagate. Worth $US32.8bn ($50.8bn), its shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq, have surged 72 per cent this year. # James Packer **Best known for: Crown Resorts** **Also has shares in:** [**Monday.com**](http://Monday.com) James Packer has built a billion-dollar US tech stock portfolio. Picture: Jeff Rayner/Coleman-Rayner It is now more than three years since Packer sold out of casino and resorts business Crown Resorts and ploughed some of his fortune into US tech stocks. Among his biggest holdings, according to filings for his Consolidated Press Holdings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, are the likes of Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Shopify and Spotify. Another holding is [Monday.com](http://Monday.com), an Israeli-based, cloud-based work management platform business. Its shares on the Nasdaq are up about 26 per cent since January 1, valuing the group at $US12.8bn. # Alan Rydge **Best known for: EVT, Carlton** **Also has shares in: Harvey Norman** Alan Rydge has led EVT and Carlton Investments for 45 years. Picture: Milan Scepanovic Billionaire Rydge’s wealth is mostly based on two ASX-listed companies he has led for 45 years: EVT Limited and Carlton Investments. EVT, which stands for Entertainment, Ventures and Travel, is the former Amalgamated Holdings business Rydge worked for until taking over as chairman in 1980. Carlton invests in EVT and blue-chip stocks such as the big four banks, Wesfarmers, Telstra and Rio Tinto. But Rydge also has been a long-term holder of Harvey Norman stock, which is up about 31 per cent over the past 12 months to be worth $7.3bn. # Ed Craven **Best known for:** [**Stake.com**](http://Stake.com) **Also has shares in: PointsBet** Stake co-founder Ed Craven.

He and American business partner Bijan Tehrani also built a 5 per cent shareholding in Australian bookmaker PointsBet, which has surged this year due to a takeover bid by Japanese entertainment giant Mixi and another from local rival Betr. # Bruce Gordon **Best known for: Nine Entertainment** **Also has shares in: Tuas** Bruce Gordon has Nine shares, but also backs Tuas.

Gordon’s biggest private holding is his regional WIN Television business, but the 96-year-old has also dabbled in other listed shares over the years. One is Tuas, headed by another billionaire in David Teoh. Tuas operates the low-cost Simba mobile phone brand in Singapore. ASX-listed Tuas is down about 14 per cent since January 1, but is up 31 per cent in the past 12 months, valuing the group at $2.5bn. # Kerry Harmanis **Best known for: Jubilee Mining** **Also has shares in: Centaurus Metals** Mining magnate Kerry Harmanis has several junior explorer stocks. Picture: Colin Murty Harmanis founded nickel business Jubilee Mines in 1987. Harmanis attributes his timely sale of the business in a $3.1bn deal at the top of the market cycle in 2007 to a meditative revelation. He is still dabbling in mining shares, including Talisman Mining, which he chairs. Harmanis also has shares in Centaurus Metals, which is exploring for critical minerals in Brazil. Its shares have rallied this month after promising drilling results, valuing the explorer at $208m.

667,Global,2025-01,"Overproduction and Price Wars Today: Empirical Evidence By Rolando Astarita-[Sobreproducción y guerras de precios hoy, evidencia empírica | Rolando Astarita \[Blog\]](https://rolandoastarita.blog/2024/12/23/sobreproduccion-y-guerras-de-precios-hoy-evidencia-empirica/) This entry is dedicated to presenting empirical evidence on overproduction and price wars, with a focus on China but also examining their repercussions on global economic sectors. Data is drawn from press sources (The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times) and reports from economic consultants and rating agencies. At the end, we provide some considerations. # Real Estate Market and Construction in China In China, there is widespread overproduction in the construction and real estate market, which threatens to drag down the entire economy. Overproduction is reflected in increased inventories of unsold homes, falling prices, and growing difficulties in the mortgage credit sector. In August 2023, the combined area of unsold homes was 648 million square meters, equivalent to 7.2 million homes, according to Reuters (assuming an average household size of 90 square meters). This does not account for numerous residential projects that were sold but remain unfinished due to cash flow problems, or homes purchased by speculators during the last market surge in 2016 that remain unoccupied. According to official data, at the end of April 2024, China had 391 million square meters of completed but unsold housing—equivalent to 6.6 Manhattans. Including homes still under construction, the total inventory of unsold housing is estimated to reach 2.9 billion square meters by the end of 2024, nearly double the area of London. In May 2024, Goldman Sachs estimated the total value of unsold homes, unfinished projects, and unused land in China at about $4.1 trillion ([China is trying to end its ‘epic’ property crisis. The hard work is just beginning | CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/21/economy/china-property-crisis-stimulus-challenges-intl-hnk/index.html)). Given the excess supply, housing sales dropped by 20% between January and April 2024, property investment fell by 9.8%, and developers' fundraising declined by 24.9%. https://preview.redd.it/1y5c5t20jeee1.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0634a05e3b3c701a819d1c516736812f2face0a3 Although in November the fall in prices slowed down (in year-on-year terms the prices of new homes fell 4.3%, 0.3 percentage points less than in October), the situation remains extremely fragile. China's central bank has provided a credit facility of up to 300 billion yuan ($41 billion), which can result in commercial banks financing purchases by state-owned enterprises worth 500 billion yuan; equivalent to 0.4% of the country's GDP. The rating agency Moody points out that they are ""a drop in the ocean"" since it can only finance purchases for 4% of the value of the existing stock of houses. We recall that investment in construction and real estate went from representing 5% of GDP in 1995, to more than 13% in 2019. In that year, more than 70% was dedicated to residential construction. It has been calculated that a 20% drop in real estate activity could lead to a drop in China's gross domestic product of between 5 and 10%, even without the amplification of a banking crisis. Between 2013 and 2018, investment in the real estate sector increased by 30% and the household leverage ratio went from 33% to 66% ([Peak China Housing\_2020\_08\_12](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27697/w27697.pdf)). From 2002 onwards, house prices increased more than sixfold. By international comparison, China's real estate boom is unprecedented. Price-to-income ratios in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen exceed 40, compared to London, 22 and New York, 12. From 2014 to 2018, the average annual growth of credit to the real estate sector was 20%, while credit to industry grew at 6%. ""How many empty houses are there now? Each expert gives a different number, with the most extreme believing that the current number of empty houses is enough for 3 billion people to have housing,"" explains He Keng, former director of the Bureau of Statistics ([Even 1.4 billion people can't fill all of China's vacant homes, ex-official admits | CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/23/business/china-too-many-homes-for-1-4-billion-people-intl-hnk/index.html)). Builders, painters, real estate agents, small businesses, and banks are owed billions of dollars. Many developers are on the verge of bankruptcy. The bankruptcy of Evergrande, a giant real estate developer, with a debt of US$300,000 million that it could not restructure, is a precedent. The firm Rhodium Group estimates that all liabilities taken by the real estate sector, including loans and bonds, reach 10 trillion dollars, of which only a small part has been recognized ([China Has a Plan for Its Housing Crisis. Here's Why It's Not Enough. – The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/business/china-property-crisis.html)). Excessive concentration in real estate industries has created many problems. Banks rely on land and real estate holdings as the main collateral to secure loans. Therefore, they provide more credit to land-owning firms, restricting credit to landless firms. On the other hand, rising house prices also induced companies whose core business is not related to real estate activity to invest in land, shifting resources from other areas such as trade, manufacturing, and technological innovations. Local governments are also heavily engaged in real estate activity. On the one hand, land sales, driven by a rising housing market, constitute the main source of local tax revenue. On the other hand, local officials are promoted, or relegated, depending on their ability to generate economic growth and the construction activity itself represents a measurable economic product. In September 2024, the Central Bank of China cut the interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, decreased the contribution needed to obtain a real estate loan and cut mortgage rates"" (*La Nación*, 8/10/2024). However, investment in the sector continued to fall: ""Real estate investment in China fell 10.2% in the first seven months of 2024 compared to the previous year, after declining 10.1% between January and June. If we talk about property sales by built area between January and July, these fell 18.6% compared to the previous year, indicated the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)."" One expression of the crisis is that the enrollment of young people in civil engineering careers is falling. ([China runs out of civil engineers: symptom of a deeper crisis (panampost.com)](https://panampost.com/oriana-rivas/2024/10/07/china-se-queda-sin-ingenieros-civiles-sintoma-de-una-crisis-mas-profunda/). The prospect of a gigantic financial crisis, dragging the economy into depression, is not a fantasy. **Overproduction and deflation in China, according to** ***The Economist*** ""From Apple to Starbucks. The dreams of Western companies in China are fading"", *The Economist*, reproduced in *La Nación*, 21/12/2024. ""In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, less than half of respondents said they were optimistic about the prospects for their business in China over the next five years, an all-time low. On Dec. 4, General Motors (GM) said it would reduce the value of its once-thriving companies in the country and close some of its factories. (…) ""Sales in China by U.S. and European listed companies peaked at $670 billion in 2021, accounting for 15% of those companies' total revenues. However, things have since gotten worse. Last year, sales fell to $650 billion and its share of total revenue fell to 14 percent. This year it has shown no signs of improvement. Of those companies reporting quarterly sales in China, nearly half saw their revenue decline, compared with last year. Companies are facing declining sales in the country, ranging from Apple and Volkswagen to Starbucks and luxury brand conglomerate LVMH."" (…) ""One reason for the poor corporate performance is the stagnation of the Chinese economy. A housing crisis has sent home prices tumbling across the country and caused consumers to adjust their spending. (…) Property sales are still falling compared to last year or will likely continue to do so well into 2025. Despite the government's promises to stimulate consumption, demand indicators are in decline. Deflationary pressure is affecting all companies in China, not just foreign ones... 27% of Chinese industrial companies were posting losses at the end of October. *Oversupply in various industries, from electric vehicles (EVs) to building materials has led to fierce price wars*. GM CEO Mary Barra has blamed a ""race to the bottom"" for the company's struggles to make money in the country. (…) In many industries, Western companies no longer enjoy the technological advantage they once had over their Chinese rivals. Chinese industrial robot manufacturers now supply almost half of the local market, up from less than a third share in 2020."" After referring to the competition Apple is facing for Huawei's production of smartphones, the note continues: ""Electric vehicles produced by BYD, NIO and other automakers are not only much cheaper than Western ones, but they are full of the smart technology that local consumers want. When the Chinese market was still expanding, Western companies were able to increase their sales, even at a time when they were losing market share. Today they no longer have that luxury"": In this scenario, the measures that governments are taking are added. ""On December 2, the U.S. introduced new restrictions on the sale of chip-making tools to certain Chinese companies... This will affect U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers.

669,Global,2024-03,"Working for majors are overrated?-I notice a trend around as an engineer about salary. Rio Tinto and BHP in Canada at least don’t pay as well as some of the smaller players like conuma, teck or capstone copper in the us. Except for the prestige of those big companies they don’t bring much to the table. I recently began think except for the name of these companies what benefits do they have on your career as an engineer in mining enough to take a lower pay. Sure the benefits are good but those small companies pay OT for their engineers maybe not teck. *I know this is heavily mine dependent since the culture of the mine influences operation more than the owner. *I also heard bad things about conuma’s toxic culture I get it but the pay especially with OT is amazing for engineers Is it just me or does it seem like working for these majors are way overrated?",Reddit

In their first season back, Utah’s front office tried to create a home town feel by hiring former Royals player Amy Rodriguez (ARod) as Head Coach and building a roster filled with local college talent. About 4 games into the season, Utah continued to build its roster with 3 new signings: Macey Fraser (NZ, former club Wellington Phoenix FC), Amandine Henry (FR, former club Angel City FC), and Ana Tejada (ESP, former club Real Sociedad). Fraser only made 4 appearances for the club with a consistent ankle injury and an extended excused absence for most of the season. While Henry brought noticeable experience and confidence to the pitch, she was unable to secure a consistent starting role for the team. Last but not least, Tejada quickly worked her way into the starting 11 as a defensive mid. After 11 matches leaving the Royals with 1 win, 9 losses, and 1 tie, ARod was fired and newly appointed Assistant Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets was promoted to interim head coach. The team’s Goalkeeping coach was also fired and the team President was reassigned to a different project. While many fans felt outraged at the sudden sacking of ARod, especially because it came right after a much improved look with the Royals tying the Portland Thorns, many have come to accept that this was the right move. Inside sources also indicate that Coenraets actually acted as head coach at that Portland game (his lineup, his strategy). Shortly after the big staffing moves, the league entered international break, and Utah made some major roster changes that enabled them to show strong in the Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup in which Utah settled at the top of their group and was one slot away from the finals. Here is a summary of the roster changes made during international break: [Photo: https:\/\/www.kget.com\/sports\/ap-japan-beats-u-s-2-1-for-shebelieves-cup-womens-soccer-title\/](https://preview.redd.it/oigjk2wmyjme1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32e4f61bbfe0a0cc37d5db21503325a28a5f5e8) **Mina Tanaka**, FW (JPN, former club INAC Kobe Leonessa) * Influence: As a seasoned international player, Tanaka was consistently able to help Utah transition into more favorable offensive positions.

Her coordination between the back line and the forwards created more scoring opportunities resulting in 3 assists and 2 goals over 10 games. Zornoza started for all 10 of her appearances, and was named to the NWSL Best XI of the Month for October/November 2024.

Another seasoned international player for the Royals coming in making big moves, including the Club’s first hat trick and the first hat trick of the 2024 NWSL season. With 4 goals in 9 games, Lacasse became the Royals’ top scorer for the season. In her 9th appearance for the Royals, Lacasse suffered a devastating ACL rupture and MCL sprain, moving her to the season-ending injury list. Lacasse will continue her recovery and is expected to miss a significant portion (if not all) of the 2025 season. **Other Major Injuries** * **Imani Dorsey**, DF, ruptured achilles in the 2nd game of the season * **Lauren Flynn**, DF, bilateral compartment syndrome in lower legs **Standout Players** [Photo: https:\/\/www.rsl.com\/utahroyals\/players\/mandy-haught\/](https://preview.redd.it/0umreb7yzjme1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=067b14a2f6675ba2df27c8c0747e2a09ba256ffe) **1.

Earning the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year Award, captaining the USWNT at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2024 to 3rd place along with a Bronze Ball win, and scoring 2 goals in 3 games during her first SheBelieves Cup made Sentnor well-known across the League. Sentnor is definitely one to watch, and she will be a critical piece of the Royals' 2025 season. Fun fact: the announcer at America First Field accidentally announced ""Ally Cenatur"" throughout the game.

672,Global,2022-10,"Concrete Evidence of the Satanic Beliefs of those in Power-Justin Trudeau was found to have violated four provisions of the conflict of interest act in having traveled to the Aga Khan's private island on three separate occasions, all while the Canadian government has given over $300 million to projects supported by the Aga Khan Foundation \[[1](https://torontosun.com/news/election-2021/gaffes-and-scandals-trudeaus-caribbean-beach-bummer)\]. Including $50 million given directly to the Foundation in 2016, one of the years in which Trudeau visited the island \[[2](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-aga-khan-trip-and-a-glimpse-into-trudeaus-bad-judgement/)\]. It is peculiar that the Canadian government would use taxpayer money to finance initiatives of one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet, with recent estimates of his net worth at over $13 billion \[[3](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/02/aga-khan-spiritual-leader-multi-billionaire)\]. Even more curious is the nature of who the Aga Khan is. The Aga Khan claims to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, and is the religious leader of millions of Ismaili Muslims. Ismailism has a history of being an occult religion practiced in secrecy, and preaches an esoteric interpretation of the Quran based on Hermetic teachings \[[4](https://prod-static-iis.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Anthology%202%20Intro-295536421.pdf)\]. Hermeticism is an ancient philosophy which claims to hold the teachings of the Greek god Hermes amongst others. Hermes is known as a shepherd of men, the deity of gain (either honest or dishonest) \[[5](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hermes-Greek-mythology)\], and the patron of thieves, tricksters and liars \[[6](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hermes#cite_note-2)\]. As the only Olympian capable of crossing the boundary between the living and the dead, Hermes is said to serve as the conductor of souls to Hades \[[7](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html)\]. Hermeticism asserts that there is a single, true theology which was given by God to some of the first humans, and that traces of which may still be found in various ancient systems of thought. It is not a coincidence that the Hermetic symbol, the Caduceus, can be found in the lap of the Baphomet, the central deity of Satanists (and the Knights Templar). Since Satan is described as a shapeshifter that takes on many forms and guises, this allows Satanists to look at various pagan practices throughout history and state that these various pagan gods were simply various forms that Satan has taken throughout history. Satanism is truthfully just another form of Hermeticism, as both are attempts at unifying numerous pagan beliefs under a single world religion, the perfect companion for a world government. It is for this very reason that Aga Khan lll was made President of the League of Nations in 1937, the first attempt at a single governmental body for the entire planet. It is also not a coincidence that Freemasons openly state: ""Freemasonry is the purest inheritor of the Metaphysics and Symbology of the Hermetic Tradition” \[[8](https://www.newjerseygrandlodge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FREEMASONRY-AND-THE-HERMETIC-DOCTRINE.pdf)\]. The wealthiest family in Canada, the Thomson family is a key component of the Canadian cabal as they own Thomson Reuters (largest news service in the world), and the Globe &amp; Mail (largest newspaper in Canada), amongst a large portfolio of other companies. Their propaganda is incredibly powerful, as it is through propaganda that the narrative is constructed and consent is manufactured. Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and Minister of Finance, worked at both Reuters and the Globe &amp; Mail, and she represents the extremely wealthy Toronto riding of Rosedale where the Thomson family lives. She also has a family history in the industry as her grandfather was a high ranking Nazi propagandist \[[9](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/chrystia-freelands-granddad-was-indeed-a-nazi-collaborator-so-much-for-russian-disinformation)\]. Additionally, she sits on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum along with Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England \[[10](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-chrystia-freelands-side-gig-with-the-wef-is-endangering-canadian-democracy)\]. Note that Klaus Schwab, founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF, also has a family history of collaborating with the Nazis. It is unfortunately poorly understood that Nazi ideology was based on the teachings of Madame Blavatsky and her Satanic Theosophical cult \[[11](https://youtu.be/fGUq3V8kl30)\]. As a gross oversimplification, Nazi ideology was a rejection of Christianity in favour of reinterpreted pagan beliefs. Widespread human sacrifice as well as the use of the Swastika across the globe was supposedly proof that large swaths of the world had once been ruled by the Aryan race \[[12](https://youtu.be/tuB2L6SN6Lg)\]. One should note that the definition of “Holocaust” is “a sacrifice consumed by fire” \[[13](https://youtu.be/7BsgACPTOYE)\]. Just like Satanism and Hermeticism, Nazi ideology is a melting pot of pagan beliefs \[[14](https://youtu.be/Yq3O8LaIcfw)\]. In the infamous video where Klaus Schwab brags “we penetrate the cabinets” of governments around the world \[[15](https://youtu.be/wUCeYJagkeI)\], David Gergen, former Counselor to President Bill Clinton, can be seen seated across from Klaus on stage. Alex Jones interviewed Gergen about his involvement in Bohemian Grove where Gergen admitted to attending, and chastised Jones for violating the understanding of secrecy related to the event \[[16](https://youtu.be/u2wHnuhkUeM)\]. Alex Jones notoriously infiltrated Bohemian Grove and captured video footage of the event, bringing international attention to the debaucherous gathering of global elites in the forests north of San Francisco where a “mock” human sacrifice is performed in front of a giant owl deity representing the pagan deity Moloch. Andrew Coyne, another star propagandist at the Thomson owned Globe &amp; Mail, had a father, James Elliott Coyne, who was a Liberal appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Prime Minister of the time, John Diefenbaker, famously fired Coyne in what would go on to be called the Coyne Affair, calling Coyne ""a communist in sheep's clothing"". Andrews Coyne's cousin, Deborah Coyne, also had a child in secret with Pierre Elliot Trudeau \[[17](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/kelly-mcparland-deborah-coynes-trudeau-memoir-is-too-much-information)\]. Both Chrystia Freeland and James Elliott Coyne were Rhodes scholars. The Rhodes scholarship is awarded to individuals from wealthy families to study at Oxford University, and was set up by Cecil Rhodes who monopolized South African and Rhodesian (now called Zimbabwe) diamond mines with Rothschild financing. Rhodes was exposed working with Nathaniel Rothschild and others to set up a secret society with the stated purpose of ruling the world in secret \[[18](https://www.wondriumdaily.com/cecil-rhodes-and-the-society-of-the-elect/)\]. Other Rhodes scholars include: Bill Clinton, former prime minister John Turner, John Evans (chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation), Dominic Barton (former Canadian Ambassador to China and current Chair of Rio Tinto, a company formerly owned by the Rothschilds), James Gibson (private secretary to William Lyon Mackenzie King), George Ignatieff (father of Michael Ignatief), David Lewis (key architect and leader of NDP), Bob Rae and countless other elitists in politics, universities and elsewhere. Marc Kielburger of WE Charity scandal fame was also a Rhodes scholar. In 2020, Trudeau awarded a sole-source $900 million contract to Marc Kielburgers WE Charity which had paid Justin Trudeau’s family over $512,000 to speak at their events \[[19](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-document-dump-proves-pmo-involved-in-we-charity-plan)\], and had initially lied by stating that they had never done so \[[20](https://youtu.be/FC_wos7MwHo)\]. WE was also found to have lied about the construction of hundreds of projects, the funding for which was never accounted for \[[21](https://youtu.be/wjRjIEXh-mY)\]. Bill Morneau, the Minister of Finance at the time, had personally enjoyed an all expenses paid vacation to Ecuador paid for by WE in addition to having a daughter who worked for the charity. Just hours before 5,000 pages of heavily redacted documents on the scandal were released, Justin prorogued Parliament for over a month in order to avoid questioning. Truthfully, WE has always been a Liberal propaganda department masquerading as a charity, filling stadiums with young Canadians and encouraging them to vote Liberal in order to “save the world”. One example of a conflict of interest in the Thomson propaganda machine can be found in the fact that the ex-CEO of Thomson Reuters, Jim Smith, now sits on the board of Pfizer and is involved with multiple initiatives with the World Economic Forum. A prime example of the Thomson family attempting to control the narrative can be found in Thomson Reuters firing their Director of Data Science for the thought crime of demonstrating that the data does not demonstrate disproportionate targeting of blacks by police \[[22](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10810363/White-Reuters-data-scientist-said-FIRED-woke-BLM-bullies-newswire.html)\]. They can't have this truth come out because it would destroy the narrative they have created to keep us divided. You can read up on the Thomson family in a Maclean's article available online which talks about how the Thomson family likes to spend Christmas with the Rothschilds, how Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, is the son of Ken Thomson's right hand man, and how David Thomson admits to being ""a secret member of a secret order” \[[23](https://archive.macleans.c...[Content truncated]",Reddit

674,Global,2024-03,"Countdown to Kickoff: Utah Royals-**Welcome to the 2024** [r/NWSL](https://www.reddit.com/r/NWSL/) **Kickoff Countdown for Utah Royals!** Utah is back in the NWSL and we’re very excited to be here! A lot of the details and predictions for this team are still TBD considering we’re working with a brand new coach, management, and roster. But there was a dedicated fan base around this club the first time around, who will no doubt be ready to support this team from the start. **\_\_\_** **BACKGROUND** **Head Coach**: [Amy Rodriguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Rodriguez) A.Rod: you know her, you love her. She’s a legend for USWNT, as well as having a great professional career in the US, including playing for the original iteration of this club. She began her managerial career in 2022 as an assistant coach at her alma mater, USC. This is her first time taking on the role as a head coach of any team, as well as her first time managing a professional side. **Sporting Director**: [Kelly Cousins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Cousins) Cousins started her managerial career at her youth club, Reading FC. During her stint as director/manager of the club, Reading went from the 3rd tier of English football to a 4th place finish in the WSL. **Captain**: TBD **Stadium**: America First Stadium Formerly Rio Tinto Stadium, or Rio T, which several fans have said they would still prefer to nickname it (a lot catchier and less cringey than America First). Located in Sandy, about a 20 minute drive from Salt Lake City. It is also within a 5-10 minute walk from the light rail station (TRAX) which is a great option for home and away fans on game day, as parking is limited. **Ownership**: David Blitzer &amp; Ryan Smith, who also co-own Real Salt Lake **Mascot**: Cleo the Lioness **Kits** Our primary kit is called [‘The Ascent’](https://www.rsl.com/utahroyals/news/photo-gallery-the-ascent) and features layers of mountains in yellow. The secondary kit is called [‘Mountain Heir’](https://www.rsl.com/utahroyals/news/photo-gallery-mountain-heir) and looks similar to everyone else’s secondary kit. **Supporters Groups**: During the 3 seasons of the previous URFC there were 2 supporters groups The Court ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/161737274489634/)) located behind the north side goal The South Side Exiles (no site link) on the south of the pitch **Subreddit**: [r/UtahRoyalsFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahRoyalsFC/) **News and Commentary**: I was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of the local news outlets with pieces written about the Return of Royalty and the roster build. There were also a few fan blogs/podcasts/twitter accounts that seemed to have good commentary and were worth mentioning.

There is a decent soccer community in the SLC area, and I found many **\_\_\_** **NEW ROSTER BUILD** An expansion club means building a team completely from scratch. There’s a good mix of NWSL veterans, a few international signees, and some exciting new prospects from the college draft. Many of the players selected have some sort of connection to Utah, whether it be their home state, or because they went to BYU for college. Local soccer fans will recognize a lot of these names and be excited for their homecoming. Since they’re all new additions, here are some of the highlights: ***College Draftees:*** **Ally Sentnor** MF/FW #9 2024 1st overall draft pick from UNC. She’s made a name for herself as an attacker on the U-20 national team as well as for the Tarheels. **Brecken Mozingo** FW #15 2024 1st round draft pick from BYU and Sandy, UT native. She can play on the wing, and her passing and handling will be important for attack building.. ***NWSL Veterans:*** **Mandy Haught** GK #1 Traded from Gotham, and also played her 2022 season in Sweden. She was a huge part of Gotham’s title winning season. **Imani Dorsey** FW/DF #28 Free agent from Gotham. She took 2023 off to focus on mental health. Kelly Cousins noted that she feels Dorsey will be a source of leadership in this squad. **Mikayla Cluff** MF #21 Traded from Orlando. She’s a Utah native, as well as a BYU alum, where she played mostly offensively. With Pride, she transitioned into more of a defensive role initially, and became a very versatile midfielder thanks to those skill sets. **Maddie Pogarch** DF #16 Free agent from San Diego. Po played full back at Wave, known for pressing and winning the ball higher up the pitch, as well as a high goal involvement percentage for a defender. **Michele Vasconcelos** FW #7 Free agent signing from Thorns. She’s another UT native and BYU alum who has several seasons of NWSL experience under her belt, as well as a season at Sevilla in Spain. **Kaleigh Riehl** DF #18 Traded from San Diego. She made up half of the rock-solid center back duo (with Girma) and will bring good experience to our back line. **Ify Onumonu** FW #11 She has several seasons of NWSL play under her belt as well as playing in the most recent World Cup for Nigeria. She should bring plenty of experience to the squad. \_\_\_ **2024 PREVIEW** **Realistic Best Case Scenario:** Obviously, a best case scenario is a successful season, which might just mean finishing in the middle of the table, as this is year #1. But otherwise, I’d hope to see this new team learn how to play cohesively together, and that Amy Rodriguez is able to flesh out her coaching style effectively on the field. **Realistic Worst Case Scenario:** I adore Rodriguez, but she has never coached a team at this level before, and it’s hard to predict how successful she can be on this stage and in this role. Likewise, there are quite a few players who didn’t get a ton of playing time at their previous clubs, so it’s hard to say how well they will perform. It’s a first season together and could be a huge flop. **Realistic Most Probable Scenario** Possibly an underwhelming season, maybe just flying under the radar and finishing toward the bottom or middle of the table. Hopefully the team will get used to playing together and develop a core of starters and a rhythm together to carry into future seasons. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading! I'll make updates to this post if a preseason roster or lineup becomes available.",Reddit
675,Global,2015-09,"Our Seats Matter-With less than a month before season ticket renewal, Real Salt Lake's front office dropped the bombshell that over 300 season ticket holders will have to pay 4x the price of their seats next year, or move. The decision was made that the rows W, X, Y, Z and the ADA row's in sections 1, 2, and 37 will be made into ""premium seating"" next year with a price tag of $2200-$2500 a seat. There are perks to joining the premium seating, like free food, free parking etc., but many of the season ticket holders who sit in these sections don't have the money to pay for their seats next year. So now, they are going to have to find other seats, in a stadium that has 15,000+ STH's in a 20k seat stadium. The follow letter was sent to only the displaced season ticket holders: ""For 2016, Rio Tinto Stadium is introducing a new premium area, the first of its kind on the venue's East Side. Above sections 37, 1 and 2, the ""Midfield Club"" joins a host of Rio Tinto Stadium's numerous premium seating options. There will be a restaurant and bar built in this club and you will have access to this. As a member of the club you will receive unlimited food and drinks, but alcohol is an added charge. You will also receive a south lot parking pass to allow you easy access from your car to the club. You will also receive other premium perks that go along with being a club seat holder. Rows W, X, Y, and Z are included in this club. The new price for these tickets is $2,200. The ADA row in section 1 is also included in the club and the price for those seats is $2,500. If you would like to be a part of this new club your have the first rights to your seats. If you do not want to be a part of the new East Side Club but would still like to have seats for 2016, I will be working to relocate your tickets. I will be reaching out to everyone to discuss the different options with you. You will be hearing from me soon if you have not already. I hope to reach everyone before the end of the week but if you have any questions or concerns feel free to give me a call."" US Soccer is the fastest growing spectator sport, and as a business decision, it makes sense to offer more premium seating, but in this case, what will the cost be? I am one of the displaced season ticket holders. My wife and I have been in these seats for 3 years. What RSL's front office doesn't seem to understand is that for many of us, we've sat next to the same fans for the last few years. We're family now. Our son, who is a little over a year old comes to the games with us. He plays with the little boy in the row ahead of us, and flirts with the little girl two rows ahead. The man I now call one of my best friends and his wife sit right in front of us. We would have never met them had it not been for our seats. What hurts the most is the seeming lack of care that RSL's front office has for us. They count the money rather than the fans. Sure, I'd love premium seats someday, but right now, we're a young married couple, like many of those around us, who love the sport, but haven't been in our careers long enough to warrant paying the price for ""premium"" seats. Between the time we heard of this new arrangement and the end of the season there are only 2 more home games (one of which was tonight against the LA Galaxy), and a month before we need to renew our seats for the 2016 season. It's unlikely that in less than months time I'm going to be able to save up an extra $3k to get me seats for next year. Oh, and in case you didn't know, RSL offered (for a small price) a way to lock in our seats for the next 3 years at the 2015 Season Ticket price. Whoops! Looks like I got scammed. There has been no mention of getting that money back. When asked about this change and what's going to happen, we've all received the same answer: ""Don't worry, if you don't renew your seats at the premium price for next year, you'll be 1st on the list to get new seats!"" I sit in section 1 in seats 15-16, right at midfield. Between my seat and the seat next to me is the midfield line. I love these seats. Next year, I don't know where I'm going to be able to sit. I can't afford the premium seats, and there is a waiting list to get into section 1. There is no way our group is going to be able to stay together with those odds. If anyone is interested the hashtag #ourseatsmatter is being used on social media. We're trying to reach out to anyone who will listen. We would like to sit down with RSL's owner and have him look all 300 of us in the eye and tell us that our seats don't matter to him. Link to the letter and some signs we held up tonight at the game: http://imgur.com/gallery/m4dTL/new TL:DR Season tickets went from $600 a seat to $2200 a seat, but only for 300 RSL fans.",Reddit

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing. Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024. Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments."" Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend. So what does that mean for investors? It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what! **While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.** **(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.** There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes. Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ahs0p9bwwxnc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde29746f0b013da0dfdcc4761ac780a92936c5a **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/iebh7shywxnc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d083df4eb0ef09f0ef7d8c754ed5bddf587fe588 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines. The team includes: **James C. Tworek - CEO and Director:** With 25 years of experience in finance, Tworek has a rich background in the industry. He began his career in commercial banking in 1998 and later, in 2005, he joined a brokerage firm as a partner, where he was involved in an in-house mezzanine development fund for 7.5 years. Additionally, Tworek runs a Corporate Finance Consulting firm, serving clients such as Funds, Family Offices, Private Equity, and Venture Capital. Since 2018, he's been serving in several Independent Director and Special Committee positions for publicly traded companies in the Canadian markets. He is currently also a Director at Florence One Capital Inc. (TSX:FONC), Lithium Lion Metals Inc (CSE: GL) Blue Sky Global Energy Corp (TSX: BGE) and acts as an Advisor to the Board of Muzhu Mining Ltd. (CSE:MUZU). **Kim M.

The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/np7219qrt7gc1.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2599446b73b496211c252c86ecd325370daff1 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing. Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024. Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments."" Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend. So what does that mean for investors?

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game.

(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ag1d84k9nboc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40c7697c9b81eb426fb72f9e77c7f7ee8a4d5744 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines. The team includes: **James C. Tworek - CEO and Director:** With 25 years of experience in finance, Tworek has a rich background in the industry. He began his career in commercial banking in 1998 and later, in 2005, he joined a brokerage firm as a partner, where he was involved in an in-house mezzanine development fund for 7.5 years.

688,Global,2024-03,"Striking Gold in 2024: How One Junior Miner Stands Out (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF, FSE:7YS)-With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story. As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD. Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing. Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024. Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments."" Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend. So what does that mean for investors? It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what! While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell. There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes. Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF) 1.⁠ ⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow: Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠All-Star Team: The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ ⁠Wise Asset Management: The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. Element79 Gold has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes...

This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. https://preview.redd.it/9bwuxolr4boc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad0ac3d2dfb1a16e46405f00e91266e7834d0102 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing. Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024. Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.** There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes. Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/6tq032k945oc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b27698ba162595e54bee0a58b62d97bbc2a4ec1c **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game.

(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/7fo8samcxxnc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc3fba6fe88535bf1b8aeb1b712c9c2cede25f2e **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/u6f5qcg7pxmc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02d62cff879d2d9b4188b1b364535a2c7c378487 **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/mjkmlf88pxmc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=819b33ab149c541de8e8327dfa5341fb8dd3a630 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines. The team includes: **James C. Tworek - CEO and Director:** With 25 years of experience in finance, Tworek has a rich background in the industry. He began his career in commercial banking in 1998 and later, in 2005, he joined a brokerage firm as a partner, where he was involved in an in-house mezzanine development fund for 7.5 years.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/as61lf8soxmc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=661573f04cacfa5cd046dfcc3879da22301a9556 **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/k6hymq3toxmc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38220d22befc58f7bc7b908bd75100121c8a7e9d **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines. The team includes: **James C. Tworek - CEO and Director:** With 25 years of experience in finance, Tworek has a rich background in the industry. He began his career in commercial banking in 1998 and later, in 2005, he joined a brokerage firm as a partner, where he was involved in an in-house mezzanine development fund for 7.5 years. Additionally, Tworek runs a Corporate Finance Consulting firm, serving clients such as Funds, Family Offices, Private Equity, and Venture Capital. Since 2018, he's been serving in several Independent Director and Special Committee positions for publicly traded companies in the Canadian markets. He is currently also a Director at Florence One Capital Inc. (TSX:FONC), Lithium Lion Metals Inc (CSE: GL) Blue Sky Global Energy Corp (TSX: BGE) and acts as an Advisor to the Board of Muzhu Mining Ltd. (CSE:MUZU). **Kim M.

CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/xldmeren9kmc1.jpg?width=1881&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdc77560ace4f8a66a8e55849e555edb193126ad **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/8o8rps8o9kmc1.jpg?width=1879&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fd96d2b1971a52176296e3bd61bd0804498595c **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines. The team includes: **James C. Tworek - CEO and Director:** With 25 years of experience in finance, Tworek has a rich background in the industry. He began his career in commercial banking in 1998 and later, in 2005, he joined a brokerage firm as a partner, where he was involved in an in-house mezzanine development fund for 7.5 years. Additionally, Tworek runs a Corporate Finance Consulting firm, serving clients such as Funds, Family Offices, Private Equity, and Venture Capital. Since 2018, he's been serving in several Independent Director and Special Committee positions for publicly traded companies in the Canadian markets. He is currently also a Director at Florence One Capital Inc. (TSX:FONC), Lithium Lion Metals Inc (CSE: GL) Blue Sky Global Energy Corp (TSX: BGE) and acts as an Advisor to the Board of Muzhu Mining Ltd. (CSE:MUZU). **Kim M. Kirkland - COO:** Kirkland is a seasoned executive with extensive experience in the mining industry specifically in Nevada and Peru.

707,Global,2024-02,"Striking Gold in 2024: How One Junior Miner Stands Out (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF, FSE:7YS)-&amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/dxyagzsht7gc1.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a38e5f6735b80b3d020afbd4103392dd4516791c **With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.** As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD. Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well. After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing. Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024. Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments."" Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend. So what does that mean for investors? It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what! **While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.** **(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.** There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes. Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK All-Star team with production experience? CHECK For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold. You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity. And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru. Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next. Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed. **Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)** 1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations. 2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold. 3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/adpqrfpvt7gc1.png?width=1881&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f60ba5eb538e72e366a68fa263b7580cbca8740b **Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown** Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens? Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine. (Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals) While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US. Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports. And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors. In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history. The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005. Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future. Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023. **Path to Cashflow** The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear: 1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months. 2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio. 3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024. **Production Potential** Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project, emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/n90sd0qwt7gc1.png?width=1879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4afa75ac6e98caaa336b093ff5f1f7b95e7057 **World Class Mining Team Tying It Together** When it comes to mining, the ones steering the ship can make or break a journey, and in the case of Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) we're looking at a World Class Team that not only has experiencing making discoveries, but also seeing them through to production, and operating mines.

The company is currently researching and developing a suite of products in which their Graphene can be applied including Graphene Aluminium-Ion Batteries, HVAC coatings and Lubricants.* **Overview** Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is a pre-revenue Australian technology company currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company went public in 2020 but had been privately producing Graphene for over 6 years prior. Led by former Shell Executives, GMG focuses on energy savings and energy storage solutions products. The company's core operations revolve around the production of high-quality, low-cost, scalable, tuneable and low/no contaminated graphene. This proprietary process is held as a trade secret with several patents held by GMG. Having carried out extensive research and development programs, GMG is about to begin scaling up the manufacturing of its various graphene products, with samples currently being sent out to numerous interested companies. Full-scale commercial production could be in the near term with GMG making their final investment decision towards the back half of 2023 for their 2032 coin cell Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery (G+AI Battery). The commission of an expanded graphene manufacturing plant is expected during the first half of 2023 which will significantly boost their graphene production in a fully automated facility. The premises will also house GMG’s blending division where the company will be able to manufacture its Thermal-XR coating and begin distributing the product to the market. # What is Graphene? Before diving into the specifics of GMG, it is important to understand what Graphene is. Graphene is an extremely thin layer of Graphite, at only 1 atom thick with the atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. This structure allows each carbon atom to be bonded to 3 more atoms around it, making Graphene the strongest known material at 100x the strength of steel while being 3x lighter. https://preview.redd.it/etyn80qmxc7a1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db7efdbaf1f0202baaf7e2c6157190c2a4d0abe8 Graphene atoms also delocalised electrons, meaning the atoms can move around more freely making Graphene extremely adept at conducting electricity and heat. The substance is the most conductive material that humans have ever encountered and is labelled as a super-material. Graphene has a high melting point of 950oC+, is extremely lightweight with a weight aspect ratio of 300m2/gm of surface area, is corrosive resistant and is molecularly very strong when integrated into materials. First discovered in the 1940s however not researched further until 2004 by two scientists that were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their work, Graphene adoption in products is just beginning to take notable hold. The global graphene market capitalisation is projected to reach $2.5b by 2028 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.5% for the next 6 years. # GMG’s Graphene Production First and foremost, GMG’s core operation is the internal production of high-quality Graphene. Manufactured through their unique patented technology process, their material is distinctively different from Graphene produced from traditional methods. GMG’s process only requires low-cost natural gas as feedstock which is then converted through the electric plasma into Carbon (Graphene) and Hydrogen. https://preview.redd.it/qztggk2pxc7a1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d80d57cac2b82ef7e54a6af9dc60293dc103497 The company’s production process can be fully automated with production being instantaneous and continuous, requiring low-cost inputs and setup costs, an ability to quickly scale the production facilities, the end product can be definitely controlled to certain desired output metrics, consistently high-quality graphene and the overall process has a low environmental impact. The end product is some of the purest carbon ever created, free from contaminants such as oxygen and silicon. https://preview.redd.it/cqinlx6qxc7a1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3835b916ab0aa90be86b9426a04a7ea78f0e291 Conventional production methods for the material require Graphite to be mined which is then chemically processed and refined numerous times into Graphene Oxide. There are numerous downfalls to this practice, which GMG has been able to mitigate, including the environmental impacts plus mining cost of extracting Graphite, the high Graphene production costs and setup due to needing to process the ore numerous times, difficulty in achieving mass-scale production, there are only various forms of definability, there are often impurities in the graphene oxide and the chemical processing of the Graphite creates a large environmental footprint. An added benefit for the company is that GMG’s production methods also create the by-product of hydrogen which the company has stated that they will either use to power their manufacturing equipment or sell on the open market. GMG also has future ambitions to extract Carbon from Carbon Dioxide in the air however at the moment production through Methan is most suitable given its cost and abundance. ### Graphene Production Costs The example below will provide an estimated cost structure of GMG’s Graphene production: The price of 20 kgs of Natural Gas can cost anywhere between US$5-20, largely depending on where in the world the gas is obtained. In this example, we will use the upper end of the gas price spectrum being US$20. Out of the 20kgs, roughly 15 kgs are carbon atoms. So for every 1 kg of carbon atoms, the price of gas is US$1.30 which is extremely cheap. GMG’s production process also uses electricity, which the company can renewably generate from Solar Panels in their warehouse facilities as well as convert the Hydrogen by-product into electricity. GMG is currently preparing for the construction of its Phase 1 Graphene production expansion with the warehouse facilities expected to be complete in the first half of 2023. This warehouse will also provide dedicated space for the company’s blending division operations (more on this later). The company intends to exclusively use their Graphene for their suite of productions rather than directly selling its Graphene sheets on the open market. # Graphene Manufacturing Groups Products ## Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery - US$108b Market This is the most exciting application for GMG’s Graphene. The company reached an exclusive license agreement with the University of Queensland (UQ), the original developers of the battery storage technology, thanks to GMG’s ultra-high-quality and low-environmental footprint Graphene. The agreement was signed for an initial 20 years however there may be an optionality to extend the arrangement which mostly depends on the life of the patents for which UQ has already globally filed. UQ has developed a specific process that perforates and splits the layers of graphene creating expanded inter-layer spatial distance (holes) in the atoms. Their approach enables a greater amount of Aluminium-Ions to be stored in more kgs of carbon, resulting in a greater energy density for the Graphene Aluminium-Ion (G+AI) batteries. So far, extensive testing of the battery has provided extremely positive data which exceeds Lithium-Ion battery capabilities. GMG in partnership with UQ professors, continues to expand the capabilities of the battery technology and has announced numerous improvements. The results achieved by GMG have been independently verified and the company has already delivered samples of both the 2032 coin-cell battery and Battery Pouch Cell to interested parties. The company has stated they have been inundated with inquiries from numerous Tier 1s, 2s and 3s across multiple industries who want to assess the battery capabilities themselves. Both the 2032 coin cell and pouch cell batteries have the potential to be applied in numerous applications Remotes/IOT Devices, personal electronics, household and grid storage as well as electric vehicles and aviation. ## 2032 Type G+AI Battery Coin Cell Currently, the 2032 type G+AI Battery Coin cell is the most developed battery technology that GMG carries which can be used in a range of products including remote controls, games and toys, calculators, watches, weighing scales, cameras and computer motherboards. https://preview.redd.it/t2cod5zrxc7a1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8b5dfe24c3f41a38cc65dbcf172fe17e63ffdc &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/xx02ldhsxc7a1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d140c2a101c541c521504ec5242691d0584f9af GMG’s 2032 type coin cell prototypes are fully rechargeable in several seconds, retain the capacity for several thousand charges and discharge cycles, are non-flammable, are relatively non-toxic and are virtually fully recyclable.

Conducted in secrecy at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, this test represents a pivotal moment in military technology. With its ability to travel at an astonishing *3,800 miles per hour*, the Dark Eagle missile can reach global targets within mere minutes, posing new strategic challenges and opportunities. This article delves into the implications of this groundbreaking technology, exploring the secrecy surrounding the test, the capabilities of hypersonic weapons, and their potential impact on global security. # The Secretive Dark Eagle Launch The **Dark Eagle launch** was shrouded in secrecy, reflecting the sensitive nature of hypersonic weapon testing. The US Department of Defense provided minimal information about the mission, citing national security concerns. A spokesperson mentioned that a collaborative team, including government, academic, and industry partners, was involved in the test at Cape Canaveral. Despite the lack of public announcement, a navigational warning from the US Coast Guard hinted at the activity, establishing a security zone in the Atlantic to ensure safe testing conditions. The Dark Eagle’s capabilities are truly remarkable. With a speed of approximately Mach 5—five times the speed of sound—and a range of 1,725 miles, the missile demonstrates the US military’s commitment to maintaining technological superiority. This test marks the second hypersonic trial at Cape Canaveral, following an initial test in December of the previous year. The implications of such tests go beyond mere technical achievements, raising questions about international security dynamics and defense strategies. # New Hypersonic Capabilities Hypersonic weapons are rapidly becoming a focal point for the world’s military powers, offering unprecedented advantages in speed and reach. The **US Army** describes the Dark Eagle as a land-based, truck-launched system capable of evading traditional air and missile defenses. Its ability to travel beyond the atmosphere and strike with little warning makes it a formidable tool for deterrence and rapid response. Each Dark Eagle unit is slated to consist of four launchers and eight missiles, with deployment expected by the fiscal year 2025. Although development has been delayed by two years, the strategic benefits are clear. As Patrick Mason, a senior US official, noted, hypersonic weapons complicate adversaries’ decision-making processes, enhancing deterrence. The speed, accuracy, and adaptability of these systems align perfectly with their evocative name, *Dark Eagle*. https://preview.redd.it/xfk49e1e1kye1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b804bbf0930864828676f34c9efaf106d0a259b # Global Security Implications The introduction of hypersonic weapons like the Dark Eagle is set to redefine global security paradigms. These weapons can strike anywhere in the world within minutes, rendering traditional defense systems obsolete. As military powers race to develop comparable technologies, the potential for a new arms race looms large. The US Navy is also exploring hypersonic capabilities, aiming to implement a system called **Conventional Prompt Strike** on its naval vessels, further expanding the reach and versatility of hypersonic technology. While hypersonic weapons offer strategic advantages, they also pose significant risks. The lack of reaction time and the difficulty in intercepting such fast-moving targets increase the likelihood of rapid escalation in conflicts. As nations navigate this new era of military technology, the need for international cooperation and arms control agreements becomes increasingly apparent. # The Future of Hypersonic Weaponry The Dark Eagle represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative era in military technology. As hypersonic weapons become integral to national defense strategies, the balance of power may shift in unforeseen ways. The US is not alone in its pursuit of hypersonic capabilities; other nations are investing heavily in similar technologies, driving innovation and competition. As the military landscape evolves, the questions surrounding the ethical and strategic use of hypersonic weapons grow more pressing. How will international treaties and agreements adapt to this new reality? Will the development of these technologies lead to enhanced global security or increased instability? As we stand on the brink of this new age, one must ponder: how will the world respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by hypersonic weapons? # SEE ALSO MAY 2nd, 2025~U.S. Navy Proves Sea-Based Hypersonic Launch Approach https://preview.redd.it/8csxbv7x1kye1.png?width=477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8490e331656e7aaefe9e174369ffd109a53ea7b9 [U.S. Navy Proves Sea-Based Hypersonic Launch Approach &gt; U.S. Department of Defense &gt; Release](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4172652/us-navy-proves-sea-based-hypersonic-launch-approach/) https://preview.redd.it/dqv5o3hr1kye1.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7bbc8a0dd1c7f31748d6e9be2dba895b6b2d95 The U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs is continuing on the path toward the nation's first sea-based hypersonic fielding with a successful end-to-end flight test of a conventional hypersonic missile from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. This test marked the first launch of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) capability utilizing the Navy's cold-gas launch approach that will be used in Navy sea-based platform fielding. ""The speed, range, and survivability of hypersonic weapons are key to integrated deterrence for America,"" Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said. ""When fielded, Conventional Prompt Strike will deliver unmatched capabilities to our warfighters."" This test was the next step in the Navy's flight testing program of the common All Up Round (AUR) that is being developed in partnership with the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office. In 2024, the programs completed two additional end-to-end flight tests of the AUR that will be fielded to both the Navy and Army. ""The cold-gas approach allows the Navy to eject the missile from the platform and achieve a safe distance above the ship prior to first stage ignition. This technical achievement brings SSP one step closer to fulfilling our role of providing a safe and reliable hypersonic capability to our Navy,"" said Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is the lead designer of the common hypersonic missile. The CPS Program has been diligently planning and executing engineering and test efforts to prepare for the first Navy fielding aboard the USS ZUMWALT. Utilizing an In-Air Launch test facility, the Program conducted an extensive test campaign to validate the launch approach prior to the completion of this flight test. Information gathered from this test will inform the continued development and production of the AUR and the first use of this cold-gas launch approach on a surface ship platform. The rapid development and demonstration of conventional sea-based hypersonic strike weapon systems supports the U.S.'s ability to deter, and if necessary, defeat potential strategic competitors. The range, accuracy, lethality, and survivability of hypersonics is a significant leap-ahead in U.S. conventional strike capabilities, complementing existing capabilities and enabling the U.S. to defeat adversary high-end capabilities.

717,Global,2020-05,"Murdoch Mafia at it again-Here’s how the Murdoch Media play it: if you don’t agree with absolutely everything the Liberal Party says and does, you’ll be smeared as a traitor on their latest McCarthyist blacklist. This is the same game they played during the Iraq War when anyone who opposed Howard's invasion was portrayed as siding with “the terrorists”. Also, the same tactics employed during the January mega-fires when Murdoch attacked anyone raising climate change as a causative factor was attacked for “politicising” the crisis when, in Murdoch’s view, the cause was arson. Sorry Rupert, but in this case criticising Scotty from Marketing isn't the same as having “acted in support of China” - as you now allege in your loyal factotum Ben English’s propaganda bulletin (aka The Daily Telegraph). On the question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, the public record demonstrates that I signed an open letter together with 100 former US Secretaries of State, National Security Advisors and heads of other institutions on April 3 calling for such an international investigation – more than two weeks before Morrison ventilated his own ideas on this subject. My main criticism of the Morrison proposal for an international inquiry was that it was advanced publicly without signing up other major co-sponsors from around the world beforehand. That would have put extra muscle behind the initiative. It would also have made it harder for Beijing to single out Australia for individual economic retribution, because there is strength in numbers. A second criticism is that Morrison had not thought through the machinery for any such inquiry, also explicitly (and rightly) ruling out the WHO conducting an inquiry into Itself because it would be Caesar judging Caesar. Guess what! When Morrison finally figured out that his own “proposal” was not gaining international traction, he decided to save political face and swing in behind a pre-existing and much weaker European Union proposal to have the WHO organise its own inquiry with much softer terms of reference. This brings us to the third weakness - which is the fact that if you look at the actual operative clauses of the World Health Assembly resolution on COVID-19, they don’t add up to much at all. There are two relevant clauses (9.6 and 9.10). One refers to the continuing work of existing international scientific bodies looking into the “zoonotic origins of the virus and the route of its introduction to the human population” - no reference to China, and no reference to any new investigation. The second refers to a new investigation by the WHO itself “at the earliest appropriate moment” into the “lessons learned” and “experience gained” from WHO‘s handling of the crisis. Indeed, elsewhere in the resolution, the World Health Assembly, supported by Australia, without qualification, commends the WHO for its work. So this is the end result that Morrison now trumpets as the great success of his efforts in securing the robust, independent global investigation into the Chinese origins of the virus which would, under no circumstances, involve the WHO investigating itself! Give us a break! Another PR ploy from Scotty from Marketing. As for the deliberate smear that my challenging the truth of Murdoch’s bullshit claims are those of a “cheerleader for China”, Murdoch’s bullyboys might want to review what I’ve actually said during this COVID crisis. In just the last three days, I’ve said: -- “Whatever is said by various spokesmen and women on behalf of the Chinese government, there are legitimate questions for the international community to know the answer to.” (BBC, 19 May) -- “This is not a bunch of Sunday School teachers. This is a hard, hardened Soviet-style Leninist regime.” (New European, 19 May) -- “We’re a liberal democracy that believes in universal human rights. That’s not going to change much as our Chinese friends may wish that.” (Eureka Report, 20 May) Sorry none of that fits the script, Rupert. But never let the truth stand in the way of a good story. I've always backed a hard-line policy on China. It's the Liberals who've changed their tune. When I was in office, they would join Murdoch's columnists in attacking me for being too hard on China. After all, it was my government that: -- Rejected China’s determined efforts to take over Rio Tinto -- Excluded Huawei hardware from being used in the NBN rollout -- Spoke out about human rights abuses in Tibet and provided visas to dissidents from Xinjiang -- Enhanced ASIO’s resources to deal with state-sponsored espionage -- Formally identified China’s rise as a regional military challenge in the 2009 Defence White Paper -- Partnered with Barack Obama to bring US Marines to Darwin, and -- Beefed up the Royal Australian Navy in response to developments in the South China Sea. Here is what The Australian wrote about my handling of the China relationship in September 2012: ""Rudd's leadership was characterised by the worst period in Sino-Australian relations for a decade or longer as he lectured China on Tibet, named the country as a threat in a Defence white paper and gave a visa to exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer. Canberra was seen as complicit in the failure of Chinalco to gain a bigger stake in Rio Tinto, amid intense friction between the two nations over iron ore prices and the jailing of Australian Rio executive Stern Hu."" Back then, Murdoch was busy praising Tony Abbott for sacrificing Australia’s core values to ingratiate himself with Beijing. Business leaders like James Packer and Kerry Stokes, who viewed Australia’s national interest through the prism of how much money they can make, also attacked my handling of the relationship because we refused to kowtow. And who could forget Turnbull's famous opinion piece for Murdoch's Australian, attacking our defence white paper as that of a Cold War warrior, by claiming China is “not a security threat""?! Of course, Abbott and Turnbull later signed up to be Beijing's ""comprehensive strategic partner"" and they sacrificed key Australian negotiating positions to secure a trade agreement. They then handed the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company and reviewed the ban on Huawei equipment being used in the NBN rollout. But all this is now swept under the carpet by the giant Liberal Party protection racket that the Murdoch mafia have become. So why have the Murdoch media launched this smear? It's so predictable. This is all retribution for me calling out the Murdoch media, in Australia and overseas, for claiming a non-existent “Five Eyes” intelligence dossier backed Donald Trump’s conspiracy claims that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory. Trump’s claimed evidence has been forcefully refuted by Australian spy agencies - and even by Greg Sheridan over at Murdoch’s Australian, who says: “All the relevant Australian agencies have looked closely at the question and consulted all their counterpart allied agencies, including in the US, and the end of that process is the Australian assessment is there is no evidence that the virus came from the lab.” The Murdoch media’s overreach runs the real risk of backfiring, gifting a propaganda victory to Beijing if and when it is formally disproven. But Murdoch is so obsessed with backing Trump and his best mate Morrison that they’ll publish whatever weasel words they can get away with. Take a look at their dodgy attack here: https://kevinrudd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Daily-Telegraph-Thursday-May-21-2020-pages-from-6-to-7.pdf #MurdochRoyalCommission",Reddit

This deal has many benefits to Aldebaran shareholders in that it provides for non-dilutive capital injections to fund future work programs on the Altar project through to completion of a PFS, if Nuton proceeds through each milestone. As well, Nuton’s proprietary sulphide leaching technologies could add significant value to the Altar project by reducing the costs and capital required for development. Our current plan for the PEA and PFS is to show both Nuton and non-Nuton cases.”* **Adam Burley, Chief Executive Officer of Nuton, commented:** *“We’re pleased to enter into this agreement with Aldebaran, which provides us with an option to acquire an interest in a very large copper project in Altar. Successful deployment of Nuton Technologies at Altar has the potential to materially enhance the economic and environmental performance of the project.”* **Status of Earn-In Agreement with Sibanye-Stillwater** The Altar project is owned by Peregrine Metals Ltd. (“Peregrine”), a private Canadian incorporated company. Aldebaran currently owns a 60% interest in Peregrine. In August 2023, the Company informed Sibanye-Stillwater that it had met its commitments to complete the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in Peregrine from Sibanye-Stillwater (see Company news release dated August 14, 2023). The process of finalizing the additional acquisition is ongoing and an official announcement is expected in Q4 of this year. Upon finalizing the acquisition, Aldebaran will hold an 80% interest in Peregrine, with Sibanye-Stillwater holding the remaining 20%. Both Aldebaran and Sibanye-Stillwater will need to fund future work programs based on their equity interest in Peregrine. **Transaction Details** Aldebaran has entered into an Option to Joint Venture Agreement with Nuton, whereby Nuton has the exclusive right to acquire a 20% interest in Peregrine in exchange for the following payments: * US$10 Million upon signing (“ **Signing Payment** ”) * US$20 Million upon delivery of an updated mineral resource estimate (“ **MRE Payment** ”) * Mineral resource estimate expected to be completed in November 2024 * US$30 Million upon delivery of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“ **PEA Payment** ”) * PEA expected to be completed in Q2-2025 * US$190 Million upon delivery of a Pre-Feasibility Study (“ **PFS Payment** ”) * PFS expected to be completed in 2026 The payments by Nuton will be made as follows: 90% will be paid directly to Peregrine and 10% will be paid directly to Aldebaran, as directed by Peregrine. The payments made to Peregrine will be utilized to fund Aldebaran’s portion of ongoing and future work programs at Altar. Upon completion of the PFS Payment, Nuton will acquire a 20% interest in Peregrine and have a 20% indirect interest in the Altar project. Altar would then be owned as follows: Aldebaran 60%, Sibanye-Stillwater 20%, and Nuton 20%, with Aldebaran operating the project. If Nuton elects not to proceed after the issuance of the MRE, PEA or PFS, the Option Agreement will be terminated, Aldebaran will retain its 80% interest in the project, and Aldebaran and Peregrine will retain any cash payments made prior to the termination unless there is an uncured material breach of the agreement by Aldebaran or Peregrine. Nuton and Aldebaran have agreed to a work program for the 2024/2025 field season to ensure that Nuton’s proprietary sulphide leaching technology can be evaluated in both the PEA and PFS. This work program involves drilling several new “twin-holes 1 ” of existing drill holes to acquire large-diameter PQ-sized drill core to be utilized in Nuton’s Phase 2 testing program (see below for details). The cost of this drill program will be paid from Nuton’s US$10 Million Signing Payment. If the drill program exceeds US$5 Million, as mutually agreed, Nuton will advance those costs from the PEA Payment. All costs associated with the actual testing of the Altar drill core with the Nuton technologies will be borne by Nuton. The Phase 1 program is ongoing (see below for details). Aldebaran will also conduct additional work programs at Altar during the 2024-25 field season to advance the PEA and PFS and potentially explore other areas of interest on the Altar property. As part of the agreement, Nuton will have exclusivity over any novel, trade secret or patented copper heap-leach related technology to be tested or deployed at the Altar project for a period of two years. **Phase 1 Nuton Program** Ten (10) samples, totaling approximately 2,100 kg, were shipped to Nuton earlier in 2024. All samples were taken from previously drilled, well preserved, PQ-sized whole core stored in the Company’s San Juan warehouse. The samples were shipped to SGS laboratories in Santiago, Chile for further sample preparation according to Nuton specifications and protocols. The prepared materials were then shipped from Chile to Denver, Colorado, and placed into several columns with a height of 1 m, with each column under different controlled Nuton operational conditions. Results from Phase 1 are expected in Q2-2025 and will be utilized in the PEA. **Phase 2 Nuton Program** Aldebaran will complete large diameter PQ-sized drilling this coming field season to provide Nuton with material to be placed into full-height, 10 m columns. The 10 m height columns are designed to simulate a typical 10 metre “lift” height in an operational heap-leach pad. The scale-up from 1 m to 10 m height columns will provide valuable data that will be utilized in the Nuton case in the Altar PFS. It is anticipated that the final results will be ready approximately two years after the delivery of the rock material. Nuton has informed Aldebaran that interim results, which will be available in 2026, should be representative and can be utilized in the PFS. **The Altar Project** The Altar copper-gold project hosts a cluster of porphyry deposits in San Juan, Argentina, which Aldebaran is expanding through exploration to deliver to the rising copper market. The 2021 pit-constrained resource estimate showed 11.4B lb Cu and 3.4Moz Au in the Measured and Indicated categories, plus 1.7B lb Cu and 0.4Moz Au Inferred. Since the last resource update, the Company has completed more than 63,000 m of drilling and discovered an additional porphyry centre called Altar United. The Company is completing an updated resource estimate, which will be completed in November of 2024. The Company has engaged SRK Consulting as Lead to complete a PEA in Q2-2025 and a PFS in 2026, with Knight Piesold as a sub-contractor. **Webinar** For more context, please join the Company in a live event on Friday, November 8th, at 11:00 am EDT / 8:00 am PDT.

722,Global,2024-01,"RIO TINTO PLC (RIO)-**Quick Facts** Rio Tinto PLC is a London-HQ mining and metals conglomerate with exposure to iron ore, aluminum, copper, diamonds and an unsubstantial business related to other rare-Earth exploration and mining. **Investment Thesis** Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) continues to cut costs and divest less-profitable segments of business in order to strengthen both P&amp;L and balance sheet metrics, with prior moves to this end reflecting positively in the most recent financial statements. While growth is not the story here (I am expecting EPS to decline modestly in the next full-year results) the company is returning value to shareholders through a 5.5% dividend yield that looks well-covered by earnings. Despite historical outperformance of their benchmark index (EFA) they have lagged the benchmark in 2023. As an added bonus, the company reports in domestic currency (USD). **Fundamentals** RIO reported falling debt/equity ratios over the past three years, showing a declining trend in reliance on debt, with the current ratio just below 25% looking very healthy vs comps. Operating margins and net margins are also notably high, reflecting pricing power combined with a sustainable advantage vs peers. Net margin for 2022 was just above 22%, rising from just under 22% in 2020. ROA and ROE are both look healthy and are trending in the right direction over the trailing three years. Despite a high dividend yield, the payout ratio is sitting around 40% in the most recent year, signaling room for dividend growth or special dividends to shareholders. **Balance Sheet Review** The company has a stellar balance sheet with substantial cash reserves, a healthy delta between assets and liabilities and an interest coverage ratio above 10x. Further, Moody's concurs with my analysis in maintaining an A2/stable credit outlook for the firm. While I wasn't able to rely on a recent rating update from S&amp;P, the most recent issued was A/stable. Fitch is silent on RIO. **Valuation** At 10x forward-earnings, the company appears undervalued with a notable margin of safety vs typical market multiples. It isn't rock-bottom cheap, but with such solid margins and a squeaky-clean balance sheet, I don't think a lower multiple looks likely. Rather, the company has historically outperformed peers with ""in-line"" multiples, meaning the current deviation offers a rare chance to enter below the stock's normal price/cash flow range. Historically, the price/cash flow range has been 9.0/4.1, but the most recent year has seen a more attractive 6.3/3.7 range. Over a considerable time-horizon, the market has shown us the company deserves a premium given at least a narrow sustainable advantage vs peers, and right now, that sustainable advantage looks to be trading at a $0 premium vs comps without one. **Technical** Looking at the price activity on the charts, I am seeing a new bullish pattern developing where higher highs are correcting back to lows that are higher than a previous low. This could be seen as a stubborn double-bottom, meaning buying is overtaking selling in the short-term. **Risks/Uncertainties** Historically, investors have proven somewhat impatient in terms of ""waiting out an earnings storm"" meaning that while I expect only a modest reduction in earnings and then a return to earnings growth in perpetuity thereafter, investors may still dump the stock who have already held the stock for many years and have sizable gains. This could derail a developing bullish cycle and create more downside than I anticipated. Additionally, commodities pricing could decline steeply, presenting a short-term challenge that could force the firm to cut back the dividend yield, which typically will create a moderate to heavy downward pressure for the stock's price. **Conclusion** RIO does not really fit cleanly into a pure value strategy, however if you agree with the market that there are things going on at RIO over the past many years that warrant a premium, I think you can get excited about today's multiples and potentially hold this stock for a very long time (with buying activity seeing an end likely in the intermediate term of course).

Being someone who is highly suspicious, particularly of something which seems ¨hyped¨ or ¨too good to be true¨ i have been trying to conduct a through assessment of the company, its associations, partners, board members and any red flags in terms of this being a ¨pump and dump¨ I currently hold just over 4000 shares.

(""Regulus""** or the **""Company"") (TSXV:REG)(OTCQX:RGLSF)** is pleased to announce that it has delivered samples to Nuton LLC (""Nuton""), a Rio Tinto venture, to begin the phase two metallurgical program utilizing Nuton's proprietary primary sulphide leaching technologies. The phase one metallurgical program (See July 6, 2023 press release) determined that mineralization from AntaKori was amenable to Nuton's sulphide leaching technologies, while the phase two program is designed to expand on the results from phase one and refine the understanding regarding metallurgical recoveries for various styles of mineralization. **Sample Selection, Preparation, and Methodology** Samples were selected and composited from each of the main mineralization styles at the AntaKori project: high sulphidation, skarn and porphyry. A total of eight composite samples were taken totaling 1,448.7 kg (see Table 1 for sample details and Figures 1 and 2 for sample locations). All samples were taken from Regulus drill hole core stored in the Company's Cajamarca warehouse. The samples were shipped to SGS laboratories in Lima Peru for further sample preparation according to Nuton specifications and protocols, under the supervision of Transmin Metallurgical Consultants S.A.C. Once the samples have been prepared in SGS Lima, a small representative sample split will be sent to Nuton for detailed chemical and mineralogical analyses of each of the composite samples before commencement of the main phase two column test work. Chemical and mineralogical data will be used to predict column test results. The remaining prepared samples will be shipped from SGS Lima to Nuton's test facilities for phase two test work, which will entail samples being placed in columns with a height of 1 m, each under different controlled Nuton operating conditions. The columns will be continuously monitored and it is expected that once samples are placed into columns, the full results will be available approximately one year later. https://preview.redd.it/7te0s8q1txyb1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e48686d608ff18b097292de3e0252eb0e9f19215 **Qualified Person** The scientific and technical data contained in this news release pertaining to the AntaKori project has been reviewed and approved by Dr. Kevin B.

The project, near Condobolin in central New South Wales, comprises a long life, high-grade scalable resource that could produce up to 40 tonnes per annum of scandium oxide, for an estimated period of 30 years. Rio Tinto currently produces scandium oxide from titanium dioxide production waste streams at Sorel-Tracy in Quebec. Once operational, the Platina Scandium Project would enable Rio Tinto to more than double its annual scandium production. This acquisition aligns with Rio Tinto’s strategic goal to grow in materials essential for the low-carbon transition. Scandium is a rare, versatile and useful mineral for the green economy and energy transition. It is considered a critical mineral by the United States, Canada, Australia and many other countries. Scandium is one of the most effective elements able to strengthen aluminium, while also offering improved flexibility and resistance to heat and corrosion. As a result, it is used to produce high-performance aluminium alloys for applications that need to be light, strong and heat resistant, including in aerospace, automotive, heat exchangers, sporting goods, 3D printing and energy transmission applications. Scandium oxide is also used to improve the performance of solid oxide fuel cells used as a green power source for buildings, medical facilities and data processing centres, as well as in niche products such as lasers and lighting. # Rio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said “This acquisition supports our commitment to critical minerals and finding better ways to provide materials the world needs. # “It will enable us to further develop and grow with the global scandium market, complementing our existing scandium production in Quebec, where we have the expertise, technology and capacity to produce pure, highly reliable scandium through sustainable methods.” # With its world-class aluminium business, Rio Tinto is also well positioned to produce more high-performance aluminium-scandium alloys to meet global customers’ needs.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 aims to address American competitiveness. However, an unintended consequence of the IRA has been the [**alienation**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/green-subsides-inflation-reduction-act-europe/index.html) of many U.S. allies and partners.

Neither the EU, UK, Japan, nor India has a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States. At a time when the United States is pushing allies to reduce their reliance on China, especially for critical minerals, such conflict is counterproductive. The critical minerals agreement [**signed**](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/united-states-and-japan-sign-critical-minerals-agreement) with Japan in March 2023 and equivalent agreements under [**negotiations**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/economy/us-europe-climate.html) with the EU and the UK are a step in the right direction. These critical minerals agreements will help mend fences with key allies while driving cooperation on critical minerals supply chains that are crucial to modern technology and have become a significant area of competition between China and the United States. **Angry Allies and Competition with China** The IRA contains provisions [**regarding**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) federal spending to reduce carbon emissions, lower healthcare costs, fund the Internal Revenue Service, and improve taxpayer compliance.

734,Global,2022-09,"AUG 31, 2022 MUX.TO MCEWEN COPPER COMPLETES OVERSUBSCRIBED US$81.85 MILLION OFFERING INCLUDING A $25 MILLION INVESTMENT BY NUTON, A RIO TINTO VENTURE-https://preview.redd.it/0fdk4ltsz4l91.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3675563ce312dff152073f08db291afb227668b TORONTO, Aug. 31, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **McEwen Copper Inc.** , a subsidiary of **McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX** ), is pleased to announce the closing of the third and final tranche of the previously announced private placement offering (the “Offering”) of up to **8,000,000** common shares of McEwen Copper Inc. priced at **US$10.00** per common share. The third tranche is comprised of a **$25 million** investment by Rio Tinto’s copper leaching technology venture, **Nuton** (“ **Nuton** ” or the “ **Investor** ”), and **$1.85 million** from other investors. The total Offering has been increased to **8,185,000** common shares, with the amounts raised in the three tranches of the private placement totalling **$81.85 million** **McEwen Copper is well-funded to advance its Los Azules Project, located in the mining friendly province of San Juan, Argentina. The next milestones are the upcoming drilling season from October 2022 to June 2023, the completion of an updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA) in early Q1 2023, and the planned IPO of McEwen Copper in H1 2023.** In connection with the Offering, McEwen Copper entered into a collaboration agreement with Nuton (the ""Nuton Collaboration Agreement”) to advance our understanding of the potential application of heap leach technology at Los Azules, including the testing of **Nuton® Technologies** for compatibility with Los Azules copper mineralization. Leaching has many potential economic and environmental benefits over a conventional milling scenario, including lower water and energy consumption, no large tailings storage facility or dam, and typically lower capital and operating costs. McEwen Copper Chief Executive Rob McEwen said: ***“Los Azules is among the largest undeveloped copper assets in the world. We recognize the potential opportunity of using Nuton Technologies to produce copper in greater amounts, more rapidly, and with less impact on the environment and water resources. I trust that our relationship with Nuton and Rio Tinto will accelerate the process of realizing the enormous potential of Los Azules.”*** Rio Tinto Chief Executive Copper Bold Baatar said: ***“This agreement will allow us to evaluate the potential to commercially deploy Rio Tinto’s innovative Nuton Technologies for copper leaching in McEwen Copper’s planned development of Los Azules. Our Nuton Technologies have the capacity to unlock increased copper production for Rio Tinto and our partners, with a low carbon footprint and leading environmental performance.”*** The principal terms of the Nuton Collaboration Agreement include: * **Nuton** **will invest $25 million in McEwen Copper** , acquiring 2.5 million common shares at $10.00 per common share, for post-closing ownership of 9.73%. * **McEwen Copper and Nuton** **will jointly undertake copper leach testing using Nuton** **Technologies** with samples from Los Azules. McEwen Copper has agreed to grant exclusivity to Nuton for one year in the area of novel, patented or trade secret leaching technology, while it will continue its independent test work and studies using conventional leach technologies. * **Nuton will have the right to select one nominee who will be appointed as a director or observer to the Board of McEwen Copper** * **McEwen Copper and its controlling shareholders will not complete a liquidity event (such as the planned IPO) until after March 31, 2023.** * **McEwen Copper has agreed to limit related party transactions in certain situations** until the earlier of the planned IPO (or alternative liquidity event) or Nuton ceasing to hold 7.5% **.** * **Customary standstill and lock-up agreement** between the Investor and its affiliates and McEwen Copper and its affiliates. * Other customary representations and warranties. **About McEwen Copper** McEwen Copper Inc. holds 100% interest in the Los Azules copper project in San Juan, Argentina and the Elder Creek project in Nevada, USA. McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE/TSX:MUX) owns a 68% share of McEwen Copper. **About Los Azules** Los Azules was ranked in the top 10 largest undeveloped copper deposits in the world by Mining Intelligence (2022). Its current copper resources are estimated at **10.2 billion** pounds at a grade of 0.48% Cu (Indicated category) and an additional **19.3 billion** pounds at a grade of 0.33% Cu (Inferred category). **About Nuton** Nuton is an innovative new venture that aims to help grow Rio Tinto’s copper business. At the core of Nuton is a portfolio of proprietary copper leach-related technologies and capability – a product of almost 30 years of research and development. Nuton ® Technologies offer the potential to economically unlock copper sulphide resources, copper bearing waste and tailings, and achieve higher copper recoveries on oxide and transitional material, allowing for a significantly increased copper production. One of the key differentiators of Nuton is the potential to deliver leading environmental performance, including more efficient water usage, lower carbon emissions, and the ability to reclaim mine sites by reprocessing mine waste. **About Rio Tinto** Rio Tinto is the second largest mining and metals company in the world, operating in 35 countries, and producing the raw materials essential to human progress. It aims to help pioneer a more sustainable future, from partnering in the development of technology that can make the aluminum smelting process entirely free of direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to providing the world with the materials it needs – such as copper – to build a new low-carbon economy and products like electric vehicles, charging infrastructure and smartphones.

747,Global,2021-11,"☢️☢️☢️ The U3O8-Ultimate ASX Uranium Company Performance and Comparison - Updated Nov 2021 ☢️☢️☢️-# Introduction Without a doubt 2021 has been the most pivotal year for the uranium industry in more than a decade. The markets, politicians and corporations appear to have recognised that without nuclear power being a part of the energy conversation, a sustainable, zero carbon emission future will be near impossible to achieve. This recognition, coupled with multiple other factors including; major supply deficits, the exponential growth of the EV industry and its increasing power requirements and, more recently, the emergence of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT), has helped the spot uranium price hit near decade long highs. As a result we have seen massive gains across the uranium equities, particularly those on the ASX. But the best part is that the current cycle is still in its infancy. It is unlikely new production will come online during the next 12 months and further uranium price increases will be necessary for brownfield and almost all greenfield projects to commence. To put how small the uranium market still is into perspective: The WHOLE global market is worth only about US$42 billion (to date). That is all the uranium equities all around the world, the ETFs and major funds are worth a combined $42billion. Now Glencore is just a single major coal producer and has a market cap of US$64.46 Billion ! Let that radiate for bit. **This post will cover**: * Performance of ASX Equities for the past year and past 3months (Charts) * The different types or stages of the ASX Uranium Equities (miners vs explorers) * Comparison of the key mining and mine development companies * Company Briefs and Updates * Activities Last 12 months * Pros and cons for each * ETF Inclusion and re-balancing * Punt’s Rocket Rating Update 🚀 For details of the [Uranium Bull Market Background](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASX_Bets/comments/lftl86/the_emerging_global_uranium_bull_market_a_summary/) \- see this post originally from September last year which was revamped in Feb 2021. For a detailed post on **everything** Nuclear Power, The Uranium Market update, SMR technology, managing waste, nuclear costs and much more - see \*\*this\*\* detailed u/Mutated-Cunt and u/Calculated-Punt collaboration post **\*\*""this"" is due soon and will be linked here\*\*** # ASX Uranium Performance - Chart Comparison [1 Year Performance Graph \(weekly\):](https://preview.redd.it/r2gw70k8viy71.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b8088ee7ad93633339b95c4850da5c55168ad1e) [3 Month Performance Graph \(weekly\)](https://preview.redd.it/eekpklneviy71.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6da50e215841d79079ed6a5ba5dda3fa624338e9) # Types of ASX Uranium Companies The uranium companies can be divided into 3x Key Categories: **Miners** or near term producers, **mine developers** and **exploration** companies. There is also one uranium enrichment technology company on the ASX - Silex Systems (ASX: SLX) - but that is not included in the coverage. **ASX Uranium Miners / Producers** This covers the few ASX companies that have a uranium mine somewhere in the world that uranium can be produced from though may require some capital investment to restart. Currently ALL ASX dedicated uranium miners have their mines shut-in on care and maintenance while uranium prices are too low to sustain operation of the mine. The uranium miners will be the first to re-introduce supply to the uranium market when higher contract term prices are signed. Some of these miners, even though shut-in, have been purchasing physical lbs of uranium (like BOE to PEN) as a strategic stockpile investment and to also meet existing contract deliveries. There are also companies like BHP and Rio Tinto that have some uranium production, though this is not a primary asset, and for the likes of BHP uranium is a by-product from the copper Olympic Dam mine. These companies are not included in the coverage. Below are the main ASX uranium miners * **Peninsular Energy** (ASX: PEN) ---- Lance Project ISR Mine in Wyoming. Previous Producer. On care and maintenance. * **Lotus Resources** (ASX: LOT) ------ Purchased the open-pit Kaylekera mine in Malawi from Paladin in March 2020. On care and maintenance * **Boss Energy** (ASX: BOE) ----- Purchased the Honeymoon ISR mine from Uranium One in 2013. On care and maintenance * **Paladin Energy** (ASX: PDN) ---- Retained the Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia - developed in the last cycle. On care and maintenance **ASX Uranium Mine Developers** These companies are those that have proved up a significant uranium resource and have conducted a series of studies or pilot plants for a large mine development. The Uranium Mine developers include: * **Aura Energy** (ASX: AEE) ----Tiris Project in Mauritania * **Bannerman Energy** (ASX: BMN) ---- Etango Project in Namibia * **Deep Yellow** (ASX: DYL) ----- Tumas Project Namibia * **Toro Energy** (ASX: TOE) ----- Wiluna Project - Western Australia * **Vimy Resources** (ASX: VMY) ----- Mulga Rock Project - Western Australia **ASX Uranium Explorers** Not necessarily dedicated to just uranium exploration as many exploration companies are in the search for other minerals such as gold, vanadium, battery metals and rare earths and will jump between what is hot at the time. This selection has some drilling or exploration committed to uranium exploration with at least 40-50% of the company and funding focused on the asset. * **GTI Resources** (ASX: GTR) Exploration in Utah and Wyoming (USA) * **92 Energy** (ASX: 92E) Exploring Athabasca basin (Canada) * **Elevate Uranium** (ASX: EL8) Largest tenements of exploration in Namibia * **Alligator Energy** (ASX: AGE) Exploration tenements in SA and NT (Aus) There are a number of additional “uranium exploration companies” that don’t meet the criteria for worthwhile assessment. # ASX Uranium Miners and Developers Comparison Chart Credit to u/gloriathehippo for helping compile this table.

792,Global,2020-05,"Another Murdoch Smear - Attacking people’s patriotism if they dare challenge any aspect of Morrison’s China Policy-Here’s how the Murdoch Media play it: if you don’t agree with absolutely everything the Liberal Party says and does, you’ll be smeared as a traitor on their latest McCarthyist blacklist. This is the same game they played during the Iraq War when anyone who opposed Howard's invasion was portrayed as siding with “the terrorists”. Also, the same tactics employed during the January mega-fires when Murdoch attacked anyone raising climate change as a causative factor was attacked for “politicising” the crisis when, in Murdoch’s view, the cause was arson. Sorry Rupert, but in this case criticising Scotty from Marketing isn't the same as having “acted in support of China” - as you now allege in your loyal factotum Ben English’s propaganda bulletin (aka The Daily Telegraph). On the question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, the public record demonstrates that I signed an open letter together with 100 former US Secretaries of State, National Security Advisors and heads of other institutions on April 3 calling for such an international investigation – more than two weeks before Morrison ventilated his own ideas on this subject. My main criticism of the Morrison proposal for an international inquiry was that it was advanced publicly without signing up other major co-sponsors from around the world beforehand. That would have put extra muscle behind the initiative. It would also have made it harder for Beijing to single out Australia for individual economic retribution, because there is strength in numbers. A second criticism is that Morrison had not thought through the machinery for any such inquiry, also explicitly (and rightly) ruling out the WHO conducting an inquiry into Itself because it would be Caesar judging Caesar. Guess what! When Morrison finally figured out that his own “proposal” was not gaining international traction, he decided to save political face and swing in behind a pre-existing and much weaker European Union proposal to have the WHO organise its own inquiry with much softer terms of reference. This brings us to the third weakness - which is the fact that if you look at the actual operative clauses of the World Health Assembly resolution on COVID-19, they don’t add up to much at all. There are two relevant clauses (9.6 and 9.10). One refers to the continuing work of existing international scientific bodies looking into the “zoonotic origins of the virus and the route of its introduction to the human population” - no reference to China, and no reference to any new investigation. The second refers to a new investigation by the WHO itself “at the earliest appropriate moment” into the “lessons learned” and “experience gained” from WHO‘s handling of the crisis. Indeed, elsewhere in the resolution, the World Health Assembly, supported by Australia, without qualification, commends the WHO for its work. So this is the end result that Morrison now trumpets as the great success of his efforts in securing the robust, independent global investigation into the Chinese origins of the virus which would, under no circumstances, involve the WHO investigating itself! Give us a break! Another PR ploy from Scotty from Marketing. As for the deliberate smear that my challenging the truth of Murdoch’s bullshit claims are those of a “cheerleader for China”, Murdoch’s bullyboys might want to review what I’ve actually said during this COVID crisis. In just the last three days, I’ve said: -- “Whatever is said by various spokesmen and women on behalf of the Chinese government, there are legitimate questions for the international community to know the answer to.” (BBC, 19 May) -- “This is not a bunch of Sunday School teachers. This is a hard, hardened Soviet-style Leninist regime.” (New European, 19 May) -- “We’re a liberal democracy that believes in universal human rights. That’s not going to change much as our Chinese friends may wish that.” (Eureka Report, 20 May) Sorry none of that fits the script, Rupert. But never let the truth stand in the way of a good story. I've always backed a hard-line policy on China. It's the Liberals who've changed their tune. When I was in office, they would join Murdoch's columnists in attacking me for being too hard on China. After all, it was my government that: -- Rejected China’s determined efforts to take over Rio Tinto -- Excluded Huawei hardware from being used in the NBN rollout -- Spoke out about human rights abuses in Tibet and provided visas to dissidents from Xinjiang -- Enhanced ASIO’s resources to deal with state-sponsored espionage -- Formally identified China’s rise as a regional military challenge in the 2009 Defence White Paper -- Partnered with Barack Obama to bring US Marines to Darwin, and -- Beefed up the Royal Australian Navy in response to developments in the South China Sea. Here is what The Australian wrote about my handling of the China relationship in September 2012: ""Rudd's leadership was characterised by the worst period in Sino-Australian relations for a decade or longer as he lectured China on Tibet, named the country as a threat in a Defence white paper and gave a visa to exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer. Canberra was seen as complicit in the failure of Chinalco to gain a bigger stake in Rio Tinto, amid intense friction between the two nations over iron ore prices and the jailing of Australian Rio executive Stern Hu."" Back then, Murdoch was busy praising Tony Abbott for sacrificing Australia’s core values to ingratiate himself with Beijing. Business leaders like James Packer and Kerry Stokes, who viewed Australia’s national interest through the prism of how much money they can make, also attacked my handling of the relationship because we refused to kowtow. And who could forget Turnbull's famous opinion piece for Murdoch's Australian, attacking our defence white paper as that of a Cold War warrior, by claiming China is “not a security threat""?! Of course, Abbott and Turnbull later signed up to be Beijing's ""comprehensive strategic partner"" and they sacrificed key Australian negotiating positions to secure a trade agreement. They then handed the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company and reviewed the ban on Huawei equipment being used in the NBN rollout. But all this is now swept under the carpet by the giant Liberal Party protection racket that the Murdoch mafia have become. So why have the Murdoch media launched this smear? It's so predictable. This is all retribution for me calling out the Murdoch media, in Australia and overseas, for claiming a non-existent “Five Eyes” intelligence dossier backed Donald Trump’s conspiracy claims that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory. Trump’s claimed evidence has been forcefully refuted by Australian spy agencies - and even by Greg Sheridan over at Murdoch’s Australian, who says: “All the relevant Australian agencies have looked closely at the question and consulted all their counterpart allied agencies, including in the US, and the end of that process is the Australian assessment is there is no evidence that the virus came from the lab.” The Murdoch media’s overreach runs the real risk of backfiring, gifting a propaganda victory to Beijing if and when it is formally disproven. But Murdoch is so obsessed with backing Trump and his best mate Morrison that they’ll publish whatever weasel words they can get away with. Take a look at their dodgy attack here: https://kevinrudd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Daily-Telegraph-Thursday-May-21-2020-pages-from-6-to-7.pdf #MurdochRoyalCommission",Reddit

795,Global,2010-05,"""The four major banks will receive a $380 million tax break fully funded by mining companies.... considering the four major banks generate $2 billion more net profit after tax than the entire global profits of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. ""-I'm a fan of the WA First group on facebook, and they're nice enough to facebook spam their press releases. I find them very interesting. Specifically the point I threw into the title. What do you think? &gt;""MEDIA RELEASE &gt;After an initial review of the Henry Report, WA First Senate Candidate Scott Cowans made the following remarks Sunday afternoon: &gt; &gt;“This is a very disappointing and dangerous report for WA because it further weakens our State Government whilst transferring significant wealth to New South Wales and Victoria. &gt; &gt;The report aims to take profits from mining companies and give them to non-mining companies through the tax system. This means instead of re-investing profits into future production, WA mining companies will fund massive tax breaks for big businesses. Telstra and the four major banks will receive a $380 million tax break fully funded by mining companies. This is totally unfair considering the four major banks generate $2 billion more net profit after tax than the entire global profits of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. &gt; &gt;Why has the government picked on mining companies with the bulk of their staff and assets in WA when they could have introduced a special tax on banks instead to fund their new tax system? Is it because there are less voters in WA? &gt; &gt;The Commonwealth says it will negotiate with the States on its implementation of the report's recommendations. Colin Barnett must be warned that Kevin Rudd will be sitting at the negotiating table with two cards hidden up his sleeve. &gt; &gt;The first card: In the report's summary it says a credit for state royalties will be available to offset the new mining tax. Then hidden deep in the detail of the report is the statement, “The refundable credit will be available at least up to the [indexed] amount of royalties imposed at the time of the announcement.” This prevents WA from increasing mining royalties beyond current levels, despite the fact the State Government is in the middle of negotiations with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to increase their royalties. The Commonwealth is stepping into the middle of these negotiations and stealing the increase owed entirely to WA taxpayers. The sneaky part of the Commonwealth strategy is by locking in royalties at the current rate, WAs long-term ability to alter mining royalties to respond to changing circumstances is eliminated. In other words, the WA Government will lose control over one of its key sources of revenue forever. &gt; &gt;The second card: the Commonwealth argues they're providing a trade-off through an infrastructure fund with $700 million going in the “majority to resource rich states”. However, there's no specifics – these will be open to “negotiation”. So just like the attempted takeover of hospitals, we'll see some short-term funding promises that aren't guaranteed for the long-term. Why isn't there a mechanism in the report defining exactly what percentage of the new mining tax WA will receive as infrastructure funding on a permanent basis? The answer is because the Federal Government wants to have the ability to reduce payments to WA in the future, just as they did with the GST. &gt; &gt;The report also fails to address the severe and increasing imbalance between WA's GST, corporate and personal tax payments and the benefits WA receives from Canberra. WA Treasury estimated this at $8 billion in 2007-08.2 Considering the Henry Tax Report will raise $9 billion from mining companies by 2013-14, the subsidy WA provides to the other States will increase dramatically. &gt; &gt;This underfunding of WA is dangerous as WA desperately needs more funding for essential services. In the same weekend the Henry Report was released, ""The Weekend Australian"" reported WA had 21% of the nation's bottom 100 schools and only 3% of the top 100 schools. &gt; &gt;In the week leading up to the Report's release, WA hospital emergency departments spent a total of 19 hours diverting ambulances to other hospitals, and urgent emergency patients had a mean waiting time of over 25 minutes. &gt; &gt;In the four months leading up the Report's release, 50 Western Australians were killed on our roads.4 According to the RAC, 1000 kilometres of WA highways are substandard and need urgent upgrades. &gt;And in the latest financial year before the Report's release, 36,332 WA properties were broken into and over 50% of robberies with firearms went unsolved. &gt;This report is a crucial turning point in the on-going takeover of State Government powers by the Federal Government. The only place the report can be amended or blocked is in the Senate which is why it's so important WA First Senators are elected.” &gt;Responsibility for political comments in this post is taken by Scott Cowans, PO Box 2259 Midland DC 6936.""",Reddit
796,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\* There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home. **IX.

798,Global,2025-07,"Anthony Albanese’s high-stakes China strategy-# Beyond the Wall: Albanese’s high-stakes China play As the prime minister is criticised over the extent of his China sightseeing activities, the government insists it is playing the long game and that face time matters. As Anthony Albanese peered into the leafy panda enclosures in China’s sweltering city of Chengdu, criticism of the prime minister’s unusually long six-day trip was building back home. Unlike previous visits that produced splashy joint communiques or major trade breakthroughs, this one yielded no single trophy announcement to parade in Canberra. A handful of MoUs and a fresh climate-focused partnership – welcomed but hardly monumental – were signed. The real prize, Albanese and his advisers seem to believe, lies in the long game. “One of the things that I find about giving countries respect is that you get it back,” he told reporters as he wrapped up his visit. Albanese’s first term in office brought the phrase “stabilisation” into currency as a means of how Australia would repair relations with China and restore $20 billion in lost trade. It was clear from this week’s visit that the communist regime and Australian businesses are keen to build on that and resume the heady days of economic integration with China. But there is reluctance from Albanese to move too far or too fast. He sees maintaining “stabilisation” itself as a tough but worthy objective at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions, exacerbated by Donald Trump’s trade war and unpredictability, Russia’s protracted battle in Ukraine and China’s efforts to redraw the global order on more favourable terms. Albanese’s strategy of respect took shape across three Chinese cities – Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu – and more than a dozen official engagements. It focused on acknowledging China’s global rise, reinforcing Australia’s economic relevance in a rapidly transforming region, and quietly drawing firm boundaries on values and security without derailing the dialogue. The symbolism wasn’t subtle. Albanese and partner Jodie Haydon cooed over pandas and sweated atop the Great Wall, all the while flanked by dozens of Chinese officials eager to roll out the red carpet. For Beijing, these scenes matter. They signal that Australia recognises China’s ascendant position – and is willing to play the choreography of diplomacy properly. “We respect the long-term vision China brings to these relationships,” Albanese says. **The Chinese Communist Party has always prized** clarity and parameters in its bilateral dealings. Canberra’s current approach – ringfencing thorny issues such as Taiwan, human rights abuses and jailed Australian writer Yang Hengjun, while talking up trade, economic ties and people-to-people links – seems to suit China. It also suits China that Albanese’s visit comes at a time of rare public friction between Canberra and Washington. Albanese is unlikely to hold a first face-to-face meeting with Trump until September, and the White House and the Pentagon are pushing Australia to dramatically lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Albanese touched down in Shanghai last Saturday as a report in *The Financial Times* said Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for defence policy, had been pushing Australian and Japanese officials to make clear what role they would play if the US and China went to war over Taiwan. Colby’s questioning had an added edge, given the review of plans to sell second-hand nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS pact. Amid this tension, China’s charm offensive went into overdrive. Albanese spent nearly five hours with Xi and Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday in Beijing, including a lunch with Xi at the Great Hall of the People. However, supporters of the government’s strategy say this isn’t about deference. It’s about survival in a shifting world order. Li left little doubt that China saw itself not as a manufacturing workhorse, but as the next global tech-industrial hegemon. “You’d need to catch all the lobsters in the sea to feed China,” he boasted to business leaders during the trip, a comment designed to illustrate China’s vast size. Chinese President Xi Jinping was on a charm offensive, avoiding thorny issues in his meeting with Anthony Albanese. Sydney Morning Herald From green steel to electric vehicles to AI platforms such as DeepSeek, China is rapidly moving up the value chain. That shift puts pressure on Australia’s commodity-led model. For decades, China bought whatever iron ore Australia could dig out of the ground. Now, as steel demand plateaus and stockpiles mount, China is demanding higher grade, less polluting and cheaper ore. State-owned China Mineral Resources Group has amassed billions in reserves, giving Beijing leverage to buffer its struggling construction sector while bypassing volatile global prices. Australia’s top miners, including BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue, have noticed. They spent the week promoting “green iron” – code for ore mined using renewable energy – to shore up the $105 billion in annual sales to their biggest customers. Yet, the challenge remains steep: the world is awash in iron ore, and China can afford to be choosy. At the same time, Beijing’s climate commitments are real. It cannot allow its megacities to remain smog-choked. That gives Australia a role, if it can evolve quickly enough. But in the tech space, Albanese was deliberately cautious. Throughout the week, he repeatedly avoided calls for closer collaboration between Australian start-ups and Chinese digital giants. The idea of Australia and China collaborating on artificial intelligence is problematic, given China’s profligate cyber intrusions and the government’s ban on public servants using DeepSeek. Australian miners were out in force: from left, Gerhard Veldsman, CEO of Hancock Iron Ore; Geraldine Slattery, BHP Australia president; Kellie Parker, CEO of for Rio Tinto Australia; and Fortescue’s Andrew Forrest. Australian Financial Review With knowledge transfer in sensitive fields such as AI and quantum computing effectively off the table, that leaves a core tension in Australia’s China policy. Canberra appears content – at least for now – to sell the shovels for China’s green revolution, but not join in building its digital future. **It’s a delicate dance**, and there was strong criticism of Albanese’s China trip – that eating Peking duck in opulent banquet halls while Taiwan is under threat and writer Yang remains detained is an unacceptable moral compromise. “One of China’s highest strategic priorities is to encourage strategically and geopolitically passive behaviour by US allies in the region,” says John Lee, a senior fellow at US think tank the Hudson Institute and a one-time adviser to former foreign minister Julie Bishop. “Beijing will feel that the Albanese government is trending in this direction as Beijing will have hoped,” he tells *AFR Weekend*. “It is Albanese’s lack of willingness to have blunt conversations about deep differences that will alarm Washington.” He criticises the Albanese government for allowing itself to be feted and upheld as an example of a well-behaved ally by Beijing without demanding any changes in Chinese behaviour. “In DC, Albanese’s notion of stabilisation of relations with China will be seen as a euphemism for Australia opting out of dealing with difficult issues with Beijing,” Lee says. As an example, he cites what he describes as Albanese’s unwillingness to have a serious discussion about the Taiwan Straits, despite it being the biggest flashpoint for a potential war between China and the US. “Albanese says Australia supports the status quo and yet it is China that is incrementally and coercively changing the status almost daily with their grey zone activities,” Lee says. “This needed a more in-depth discussion of Australia’s opposition to this \[and\] that appears not to have taken place. Had that kind of discussion occurred, Beijing would not have been as pleased about the visit. “To lead such a large Australian gathering without raising issues of Chinese predatory and illegal economic behaviour is another example. That is the point: Albanese is allowing China to determine what Australian comfort levels ought to be.” But Albanese insists such concerns are raised – in hours-long private sessions, not over dumplings. “These things take time,” he said this week. As strategic rivalry between the United States and China intensifies – across military, economic and technological fronts – both superpowers are racing to cement their influence over the next century of global growth. Albanese acknowledges that China is more confident about its role as a power in the world than ever before. But as China continues to think in decades, even centuries, Australia may soon have to answer harder questions. How far is it willing to align with China’s strategic vision? And can it navigate that alignment without jeopardising its alliance with Washington? “The prime minister’s drawn-out visit to China leaves no doubt about his seriousness when it comes to risk-informed engagement with our region’s dominating power,” says Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College and a former Australian diplomat. “It consolidates the patient diplomacy of the government’s stabilisation agenda. It also raises expectations that there is much more the two nations can do together. Yet, it is hard to see how much further we can go without increasing Australia’s vulnerability to geopolitical shocks or deepening economic reliance on an authoritarian power that has form when it comes to translating dependence into coercion. “The PM and Australian officials can take some satisfaction from their feat of diplomatic choreography – touching on the hard issues as well as the easy ones, yet maintaining diplomatic poise. “But there is no escaping the dissonance with other present realities, including Taiwan’s drills in self-defence ...[Content truncated]",Reddit
799,Global,2025-07,"Target hostile countries, not us, drug giant CSL tells Trump-# Target hostile countries, not us, drug giant CSL tells Trump [**Michael Smith**](https://www.afr.com/by/michael-smith-j7geb) and [**Jessica Gardner**](https://www.afr.com/by/jessica-gardner-j7gbm)Jul 10, 2025 – 5.00amSaveShare Gift this article CSL has urged the Trump administration to target hostile countries that could weaponise the supply of pharmaceuticals rather than place a blanket tariff on medicines as it lobbies for exemptions of duties of up to 200 per cent flagged by the White House in its expanding trade war. The country’s [largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/csl-says-on-track-for-double-digit-growth-but-vaccine-sales-weak-20250210-p5lb0u) told US officials investigating the import of medicines that it understood President Donald Trump’s “concern that certain countries may ‘weaponise’ control over pharmaceutical supplies” and said this was the best reason for the government to focus its work on “specific non-allied countries”. Donald Trump’s tariff on pharmaceutical products would affect more than $2 billion in Australian exports, largely made up of CSL’s goods manufactured in Melbourne. Australian Financial Review The argument was contained in a detailed submission to the Commerce Department, which has begun reviewing imports in response to requests from the Trump administration. The investigation paves the way for the president to impose tariffs on national security grounds. After [months of negotiation](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/pharmaceuticals-to-be-hit-by-major-trump-tariff-csl-slumps-5pc-20250409-p5lqeo), and little discussion of tariff plans, Trump on Wednesday said he wanted to place levies not only on pharmaceuticals but on copper, a move that could affect BHP and Rio Tinto, along with smaller ASX-listed producers like MAC Copper and Aeris Resources. “I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50 per cent,” Trump said when asked by a reporter what the rate on those products would be. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said later in an interview on CNBC that the duties could take effect later in July or on August 1. It was unclear at what stage of the copper processing cycle tariffs would kick in. The tariffs are the latest attempt by the White House to implement Trump’s America First agenda, which seeks to revive US manufacturing by making imports more expensive. Donald Trump, third from right, at a White House cabinet meeting where he flagged a 200 per cent drug tariff. AP They follow 50 per cent levies on [steel and aluminium](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-signs-order-hiking-steel-aluminium-tariffs-to-50pc-20250604-p5m4rg), and are separate from the country-specific tariffs on most goods imported into the country that kick in on August 1. While little copper is exported from Australia directly to the US, a tariff on pharmaceutical products would affect more than $2 billion in exports, largely made up of goods manufactured at CSL’s plant in Melbourne. Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Wednesday said the prospect of such a large hit on pharmaceuticals was a major concern, adding that the government was urgently seeking more details on the plan Trump had announced. “But I want to make it really clear once again, as we have on a number of occasions before, our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not something that we’re willing to trade away or do deals on. That won’t change,” he said. Major American pharmaceutical companies have long complained about the PBS, saying the scheme often subsidises cheaper generic products. Some of the biggest US businesses including Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also lobbied the White House to force Australia to [pay more for drugs on the PBS,](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/why-us-drug-giants-are-so-angry-about-australia-s-pbs-20250320-p5ll10) and accelerate the approval process. In its submission to the Commerce Department investigation, obtained by *The Australian Financial Review*, CSL executive Michael Deem said the US should exempt Australia, Switzerland, the European Union and the United Kingdom in a bid to reduce its concerns about medicines supply. The submission also calls for tariffs to be phased in over five years to allow for supply chain adjustments, and an exemption for equipment used by the biotech sector to produce medicines. CSL said the tariff plan would increase costs for patients and limit their access to therapies. “CSL encourages the US government to focus its investigation on these specific non-allied countries, rather than on all imports of pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other derivative articles from the many trading countries that have been reliable partners in the past,” it said. CSL has 19,000 staff in the US, about 60 per cent of its workforce and has announced plans to invest $2 billion in production in the country. Its products are made from blood plasma collected in the US, but they are fractionated – the process of separating whole blood into its individual components – in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. Blood plasma products are used to treat a range of life-threatening diseases. CSL shares fell slightly, down $2.23 to close at $243.71. The minimal move suggests investors have already priced in the potential US tariffs, with the stock sliding almost 20 per cent over the last 12 months. “It is weighing on the share price because CSLs’ earnings growth has been good, but the shares have gone down. They don’t believe the impact of the tariffs will be high, but the problem is the devil is in the detail and the goalposts keep shifting,” Investors Mutual senior portfolio manager Hugh Giddy said. “The trouble with Trump is nothing ever seems final. He seems to want to make a threat to force people to negotiate, so the ultimate end point is often so different to the original announcement.” A CSL spokesman declined to comment further. CSL accounts for the bulk of Australia’s pharmaceutical exports to the US, but investors said steep tariffs would damage confidence in healthcare and biotech companies, particularly start-ups seeking investment. “Uncertainty in the health sector that this creates has a negative impact on the view of Australia as an attractive place to invest in R&amp;D in the health sector and clinical trials in particular,” King &amp; Wood Mallesons partner Suzy Madar said. “The impact is likely to be much greater on the smaller end of town, closer to the start-up phase, where they don’t have that opportunity.” Some analysts have noted that any tariff on exports from Australia could damage US pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, [which has a local manufacturing facility](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/pfizer-invests-150m-in-melbourne-to-fight-superbugs-20240805-p5jznt) where it produces oncology pharmaceuticals that are sent to North America. AstraZeneca also manufactures in Australia. Medicines Australia, which represents the local pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry, said Australia imported more medicines from the US than it exported. “We also believe introducing tariffs on US imports of innovative medicines is not going to encourage Australian manufacturers to relocate to the US, but it will be detrimental to US competitiveness and increase their healthcare costs,” a spokesman said on Wednesday. The White House is expected to begin imposing other, country-specific tariffs from August 1, having paused them in April. Exporters from Australia will pay the 10 per cent baseline tariff applied on several countries. Japan and South Korea, two of Australia’s biggest trading partners after China, were told this week [they faced tariffs of 25 per cent](https://www.afr.com/world/asia/no-escape-for-allies-japan-south-korea-in-trump-s-tariff-update-20250708-p5mday) on most exports. # The biggest stories in business, markets and politics and why they matter.

According to four people familiar with the talks, **Washington could convert a proposed $50 million Defense Production Act grant into an equity stake of roughly 8%.** While no agreement has been finalized, the move underscores U.S. efforts to secure critical minerals vital to electric vehicles, defense technologies, and semiconductors. Critical Metals purchased the Tanbreez deposit last year for $5 million in cash and $211 million in stock, reportedly outbidding a higher Chinese offer thanks to U.S. government backing. The deposit holds significant quantities of rare earths, gallium, and tantalum—resources largely dominated by China. Once operational, Tanbreez is expected to produce 85,000 metric tons of concentrate annually, with full production targeted by 2026. **This potential investment follows similar U.S. stakes in Lithium Americas and MP Materials, reflecting a broader strategy to diversify supply chains away from Chinese dominance. The Trump administration has also considered reallocating $2 billion from the CHIPS Act—originally aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing—to support critical minerals projects.** ***In addition to the possible equity stake, the U.S. Export-Import Bank is reviewing a $120 million loan to accelerate development of Tanbreez***. That funding would cover technical work and bring the project into production. Despite the momentum, challenges remain, including Greenland’s slow-moving mining sector, environmental concerns, and the harsh Arctic conditions surrounding the site. Greenland’s strategic importance is not new. Both Trump and Biden administrations have sought stronger ties, with senior officials visiting Nuuk to encourage investment. Trump even floated the idea of buying Greenland outright in 2019. **Today, the focus has shifted to securing rare earths—critical for national security and future technologies—making the Tanbreez project a centerpiece of Washington’s mineral strategy.** # Oct. 4th 2025~Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025 [Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025 - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/sponsored-content/navigating-the-surge-how-mining-can-meet-critical-mineral-demand-sustainably-beyond-2025/) [Meeting Soaring Demand for Critical Minerals](https://preview.redd.it/ymhamhezk2tf1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e716cca2fdeb6f119635b14060b7108ef6ca69) The most critical issue facing global mining companies beyond 2025 is the surge in demand for energy transition minerals—such as copper, lithium, and nickel—against a backdrop of supply chain stress, regulatory scrutiny, and rapidly evolving sustainability expectations. Addressing this challenge requires smarter, more integrated management of mineral sourcing, sustainability impacts, and market risk. As the world accelerates toward decarbonization, the International Energy Agency projects that demand for critical minerals will at least triple by 2030. Meanwhile, global supply chains remain fragmented, with extraction and refining concentrated in a few countries and complicated by geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and fluctuating prices. *Traditional mining operations are challenged to scale up production quickly and responsibly while maintaining transparency, traceability, and compliance across dozens of jurisdictions.* **Supply Chain Complexity and Ethical Sourcing** Supply chain complexity and ethical sourcing have become critical challenges for mining companies amid growing global scrutiny on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. The supply chains for critical minerals now span multiple countries and involve numerous tiers of suppliers, each subject to different regulatory regimes and ethical expectations. This fragmentation creates significant risks—from exposure to labor rights violations and environmental damage to supply disruptions caused by compliance failures or geopolitical factors. To address these challenges, mining companies require integrated digital platforms that consolidate and monitor real-time data from extraction through processing to final delivery. These platforms automate supplier audits, track certifications, and validate compliance with evolving ESG regulations, including conflict minerals legislation and responsible sourcing frameworks. By creating a single source of truth for supply chain transparency, organizations can detect and mitigate risks earlier, ensure ethical practices across their value chain, and generate the documentation needed for investor reporting and customer assurance. **Sustainability and ESG Expectations** Sustainability and ESG expectations are rapidly becoming paramount in the mining industry as stakeholders increasingly demand transparent, accountable, and responsible operations. Mining companies face mounting pressure from governments, investors, local communities, and civil society to minimize environmental footprints, mitigate climate risk, and deliver positive social outcomes. By 2050, over 60% of mining firms aim to achieve net-zero emissions or carbon neutrality, leading to wide-scale adoption of renewable energy, electrification of fleets, and precision mining techniques designed to reduce land disturbance and pollution. Robust ESG frameworks increasingly govern mining operations, reflecting the growing demand for responsible and transparent practices. Among the most significant developments is the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative (CMSI), which unites the best elements of four leading standards—the Copper Mark’s Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA), Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM), World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles, and ICMM’s Mining Principles—into a single, unified global standard. This consolidation simplifies the complexity of the current standards landscape and sets clear, high-bar expectations for responsible mining practices across ethical business conduct, worker and social safeguards, social performance, and environmental stewardship. Alongside CMSI, key international frameworks such as ISO standards and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol continue to play vital roles in aligning environmental management and carbon emissions reporting within mining operations. Additionally, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Mining Sector Standard 2024 and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) 2.0 provide rigorous, auditable benchmarks for sustainability and social responsibility, enabling mining companies to deliver transparent and credible ESG disclosures. These standards require detailed, auditable disclosures on climate impact, water stewardship, emissions, and social governance, pushing mining companies towards consistent, comparable, and trustworthy reporting. Together, these frameworks and standards promote continual improvement and accountability in mining’s environmental, social, and governance performance. They guide the industry toward harmonized reporting, diligent risk management, and enhanced stakeholder trust, helping mining companies meet the expectations of regulators, investors, communities, and customers worldwide. Automated digital platforms that consolidate environmental and social data, support compliance, reduce manual workload, and enable rapid adaptation to evolving regulatory contexts. **Geopolitical Uncertainty** Geopolitical uncertainty has emerged as a central risk for mining companies striving to meet the booming demand for critical minerals in 2025. Resource nationalism, shifting regulatory landscapes, and the concentration of mineral extraction and refining in just a handful of countries have made supply chains more fragile and unpredictable. Governments are increasingly enacting export controls, renegotiating mining agreements, and imposing higher environmental and social standards—all of which can abruptly alter the business landscape for global miners. In this high-stakes environment, advanced risk management solutions provide crucial strategic support—they enable dynamic scenario modeling, track global regulatory changes, and facilitate swift adaptation to new requirements. With real-time intelligence and agile compliance workflows, mining companies can proactively respond to evolving risks, protect their operations, and maintain competitiveness on the world stage. **Technology’s Role in Meeting Demand** Technology plays a vital role in helping mining companies meet the rapidly growing global demand for critical minerals by enhancing operational efficiency, transparency, and compliance while reducing environmental and social risks. In 2025 and beyond, digital transformation in mining includes the integration of AI, automation, and advanced analytics into daily operations, enabling companies to scale production sustainably and responsibly.

801,Global,2025-08,"‘Long may she reign’: How powerful is Gina Rinehart?-# ‘Long may she reign’: How powerful is Gina Rinehart? Having lost her close relationship with Peter Dutton, Gina Rinehart is working to exert influence in a radically different Canberra. By Jason Koutsoukis 9 min. readView original Back in March, when Coalition strategists still gave themselves half a chance of winning the coming election, Gina Rinehart asked to meet Sussan Ley. Rinehart’s bond with then Liberal leader Peter Dutton was already sealed, immortalised in a painted mural that depicts her 70th birthday, which Dutton flew across the country to attend for just 40 minutes. Now Australia’s richest woman wanted to get to know the Liberal deputy. The meeting was arranged in Rinehart’s home town of Perth, with Ley tying the travel in with campaign events for a handful of local Liberal candidates. “It was really just a get to know you kind of thing,” says one Coalition adviser. “Her contact with Dutton was direct, one to one, and she felt she needed to build up a rapport with Ley.” When Dutton became leader two years earlier, he quickly fell under Rinehart’s sway, flying to Perth just days after taking the Liberal leadership and later adopting much of her policy wish list – especially on nuclear power, public service cuts and attacks on “wokeness”. Still, the relationship with Dutton was not without strain. Rinehart made it clear during this year’s election campaign that she opposed the Coalition’s gas reservation policy, which required companies to sell into the domestic market at capped prices – a measure she regarded as anti-investment and poorly designed. As a major investor in Queensland gas producer Senex, she was also frustrated by Dutton’s refusal to abandon net zero and his caution on tax and industrial relations. Since the election, Ley has declined to meet with Rinehart again – even on her July tour of Western Australia. That distance may soon harden into outright conflict. As opposition leader, Ley has made it clear her ultimate goal is to meet voters where they are – widely read as code for retaining the net zero target the Coalition is currently reviewing. One Coalition adviser says Ley sees staying committed to net zero as “essential to rebuilding Coalition support in metropolitan areas”. Rinehart, by contrast, has made abolishing net zero a personal crusade. In a blistering opinion piece this week in Rupert Murdoch’s metropolitan tabloids, she denounced net zero as a threat to industry and the basic functions of daily life. She branded the Paris climate accord as “living standards-destroying”. Conjuring a future in which Australian Defence Force vehicles, ships and planes could be stranded without fuel, and ambulances, helicopters and the Royal Flying Doctor Service grounded because emissions quotas had been exceeded, her rhetoric was pure climate war. The “net zero cult”, Rinehart wrote, would leave hospitals without doctors, farmers bankrupt and households forced to choose “between eat or heat”. For Rinehart, compliance with net zero represents wasted money and the sacrifice of shareholder value. For Ley, it is political reality – the price of remaining electable. “Gina is not a big fan of the Liberal Party at the moment,” one person familiar with her thinking tells *The Saturday Paper*. “There’s people within the Liberal Party she trusts, no question, but there are also Liberal Party people that she simply will not have a bar of.” Inside the Coalition, the net zero gap is widening. Hard-right figures such as Barnaby Joyce, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Alex Antic, as well as campaign groups such as Advance, are pressing for a retreat from net zero, emboldened by Rinehart’s stance. Ley, mindful of the electoral map and the May 3 election rout, is resisting. She knows walking away from climate commitments would play straight into Labor’s hands. The division illustrates how Rinehart works in Canberra. She is a significant donor – $500,000 to the Coalition in the 2023–24 financial year alone – and uses direct contact with Coalition figures to push her policy agenda. Although the relationship with Ley is not as strong as it was with Dutton, she still has connections with various senior party members. For most Labor MPs, that’s all upside. They believe Australians are with them on climate policy, on renewables, even on social inclusion. Whenever they hear Rinehart denouncing net zero as a “cult”, caucus members smile. To them, her interventions make it harder for the Coalition to capture the centre ground and easier for Labor to draw the contrast. In that sense, the government would rather Rinehart keep talking. The louder she rails against climate action and so-called big government, the more she confirms Labor’s argument: that the Coalition is hostage to billionaires and culture warriors, while the government governs from the sensible centre. “Gina? One of our greatest assets,” quipped one Labor backbencher from Western Australia. “Long may she reign over them!” The more she ties herself to Donald Trump’s brand of politics, the logic goes, the easier it becomes for Labor to frame the Coalition as out of step with mainstream voters. “It’s just very unfortunate for her that Australians have taken a very, very intense dislike to Trump,” noted another Labor source. “Every time Gina opens her mouth, she drags the Coalition further into a fight we’re happy to have.” [After spending the United States election night at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2024/11/23/how-trumps-victory-emboldens-gina-rineharts-political-plays), one of only a few Australians present, accompanied by former Liberal Party vice-president Teena McQueen, Rinehart doubled down this week on her investment in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. She now owns 67 per cent of the company, which operates the social media platform Truth Social. The company booked a US$20 million quarterly loss and her holding is now worth about US$4.5 million. “The consequence is that the sort of power she might be expected to wield amongst key elements of the power elite of this country isn’t what it used to be, because even they can sort of recognise the vibe,” the Labor source says. “And the vibe is against anyone who looks Trump-like, which is what she is. She’s just Trump in a dress.” [](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2024/12/14/anthony-pratts-box-seat-ride-white-house-influence) Since becoming prime minister, Anthony Albanese has never sat down with Rinehart one on one. The distance is ideological – Labor is not about to be lectured on net zero or the virtues of nuclear energy – but that doesn’t mean Rinehart’s business interests are ignored. With Rinehart represented in Canberra by Perth-based lobbyists GRA Partners, the government takes care to keep its relationship with Rinehart and her corporate interests professional. The approach was on display during Albanese’s visit to China in July. At a press conference following a high-profile round table with Chinese steelmakers in Shanghai, he was flanked by the heads of Australia’s iron ore majors: BHP’s Australian president, Geraldine Slattery; Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Australia, Kellie Parker; Fortescue’s executive chairman, Andrew Forrest; and Gerhard Veldsman, chief executive of Hancock Iron Ore. Albanese praised the presence of all four, calling it a sign of “how significant the relationship is between Australian businesses and Chinese businesses and, in particular, the importance of Australian iron ore exports for steel production here in China”. Veldsman, in turn, publicly thanked the prime minister for bringing Hancock to the table. “Today was really a fantastic step forward, and I want to thank the prime minister for getting us all together,” he said, stressing Hancock’s role as the smallest of the majors and its pride in serving Chinese and Asian customers over the past decade. The optics were clear: while Rinehart has not sought a private audience with Albanese, her companies have a reserved seat under his imprimatur. Rinehart’s companies also enjoy a productive relationship with the federal resources minister, Madeleine King. It is a neat division. As a political actor, Rinehart is kept at arms-length – no private audiences, no privileged channel to the prime minister or the kind of closeness she enjoyed with Peter Dutton. As a business owner, however, her company is treated like any other major player in the resources sector. When Labor was last in power, under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2007 to 2013, the relationship was very different. Wayne Swan, as treasurer, went to war with Rinehart over the mining tax, casting her as the emblem of an industry unwilling to share the nation’s resources with the people who owned them. In his 2014 memoir, *The Good Fight*, Swan recalls the “hypocrisy and moral obscenity” of the 2010 “billionaires’ rally” in Perth, where Rinehart, decked out in her trademark pearls, stood alongside Andrew Forrest to denounce the resource super profits tax. For Swan, whose memories are laced with disbelief at the power the miners wielded, it was a display of sheer greed: the richest Australians demanding special treatment while ordinary taxpayers carried the load. The industry’s campaign, he writes, was “coordinated in military style – full of fear and threats about mine closures”. It was reinforced by a media barrage that elevated sympathetic columnists while drowning out Treasury officials and Nobel laureates. The mining companies, Swan recalled, never grasped the democratic fact that Australians owned the resources being dug from the ground. Yet under their pressure, the government was forced to retreat, redesigning the tax in 2010 and ultimately dismantling it altogether. What stuck with Swan was less the policy defeat than the corrosion it revealed: a public discourse in which billionaires could dominate with “calculated disinformation”, wh...[Content truncated]",Reddit
802,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace.-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\* There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home. **IX.

The tech companies are aligning to push back on China’s rare earth market dominance and its risks for industries reliant on magnets** A U.S. startup backed by Stellantis, General Motors, and other global manufacturers is attempting to build a large-scale factory that does not rely on rare-earth elements. If successful, the venture could reduce U.S. dependence on China’s supply of critical minerals. # Fighting the rare earth dependence Niron Magnetics, the company leading the initiative, has developed a new magnet technology using iron nitride. The innovation is the result of decades of research by the company’s co-founder, Jian-Ping Wang, a professor at the University of Minnesota. Niron claims that the compound is cheaper, easier to source and also 18% more potent than conventional [rare-earth magnets](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-china-rare-earths-remains-unresolved/). The company has begun work on a 1,500-tonne-per-year facility in Sartell, Minnesota, which it says will be capable of meeting around 3% of U.S. domestic magnet demand when operational in early 2027. Global demand for magnets is projected to surpass supply by some 55,000 tonnes by 2030. “Permanent magnets are in every device that powers the modern world,” Mark Champine, who heads Stellantis’ North America technical center, [said](https://www.ft.com/content/f0e37601-a15c-40d2-a241-aa835b686cf6). “Niron is meeting an urgent demand.” # Beijing dominates the rare earths market Magnets are indispensable in modern technologies, embedded in everything from smartphones and wind turbines to electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. Until now, most high-performance magnets have relied on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. These minerals are geologically scarce, difficult to refine, and largely controlled by China. Beijing dominates every stage of the rare-earth supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet production. This market dominance has long been a source of concern for Washington and U.S. industries, especially as geopolitical tensions with China rise. The Japanese company Hitachi has a presence in the field, but Chinese producers overwhelmingly lead the market. To counter this imbalance, [Cryptopolitan reported](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-government-rare-earth-china-comparison/) that the Trump administration invested heavily in the Mountain Pass mine in California through MP Materials, effectively making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. But building mines and processing facilities is slow, capital-intensive, and environmentally fraught. But with Niron’s approach of avoiding using rare earths entirely, the company claims it can deliver a cheaper, cleaner, and geopolitically safer magnet. “Western rare earth companies are playing the Chinese at the same game,” said Jonathan Rowntree, Niron’s chief executive. “We don’t need to bring a mine online.” John Ormerod, a rare earths consultant at JOC LLC, preached caution. “This is a holy grail kind of magnet, since iron and nitrogen are plentiful and low cost,” he said. “But we don’t have any data from Niron, which is frustrating and makes it impossible to make a hundred per cent accurate assessment.” Despite the unanswered questions, Niron has attracted heavyweight backing. In addition to Stellantis and GM, its investors include Volvo Cars, Samsung’s venture arm, and other major industrial players. The company has raised about $150M in private funding and secured significant government support in the form of a $52.2M tax credit earlier this year, along with $17.5M in grants from the Department of Energy’s research arm in 2022. Experts say financing is important for Niron as the company will eventually have to prove its technology in demanding fields such as electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy. “The magnet market covers everything from consumer electronics to military hardware,” Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated. “The smaller end consumer market will probably be first, but since the US has such a large magnet supply deficit, there’s no reason to not try.” # SEPT. 27th, 2025~Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths *New U.S. mining projects, executive orders, and defense-backed investments aim to counter Beijing’s market dominance.* [Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths – \[your\]NEWS](https://yournews.com/2025/09/27/3976976/trump-administration-moves-to-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/) https://preview.redd.it/6w2iyl7qxorf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52afc5fdf009069ed264efefb7c935d7418aa653 President Donald Trump’s administration is accelerating efforts to reduce America’s reliance on China for rare earth elements and other critical minerals, a dependency that U.S. officials and industry leaders call an existential threat. The push combines domestic mining incentives, expedited permitting, deep-sea exploration, and defense-backed market guarantees designed to outmaneuver Chinese state-subsidized control of global supply chains, according to an in depth [report by The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/how-trump-admin-is-breaking-the-ccps-hold-on-rare-earths-5908257?ea_src=frontpage&amp;ea_med=section-1). On July 11, 2025, Ramaco Resources is slated to begin extracting more than 450 tons of rare earths from its 4,500-acre Brook Mine in Wyoming. This marks one of several new U.S. projects launched after Trump’s return to office, framed as the next phase of a decades-long struggle to revive American mining and refining. The [National Materials and Minerals Policy Act of 1980](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10930/pdf/COMPS-10930.pdf) originally set the priority, but U.S. manufacturers have grown increasingly dependent on imports, particularly from China, as documented by the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/mineral-commodity-summaries-2025). **China’s dominance became apparent in the 2010 “rare earths crisis” and has deepened through successive export restrictions, most recently in April when Beijing added seven minerals—including dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium—to its embargo list.

After his 2024 reelection, Trump issued the “Unleashing American Energy” directive, followed by a March [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) that opened more federal lands and invoked the Defense Production Act.

The Pentagon decision to take an [equity stake](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/), the largest U.S. rare earth miner, in July and support the company with a price floor surprised many in the industry, Chalmers told CNBC. But it was a necessary step that the White House should now follow with more deals to diversify the U.S. supply chain and reduce the risk that would come with backing a single national champion, the CEO said. “One company doesn’t fix it,” Chalmers said of the MP Materials deal. “You have to have multiple deals to ensure that you don’t just have the company risk, because all companies aren’t going to deliver.” The White House is “not ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn’t mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal,” a Trump administration official told CNBC. Rare earths are key inputs in weapons platforms such as the F-35 warplane as well as consumer products like electric vehicles and smartphones. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf). China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said. “We’ve seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market — and something needed to give,” Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC. # Possible rare earth targets Energy Fuels’ stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. **Critical mineral miner** [**NioCorp Developments**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NB-CA/) **is also up almost 200%**, [Ramaco Resources](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/METC/) has gained 140%, and [USA Rare Earth](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) is up more than 70%. MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said. Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said. Energy Fuels is focused on “providing a product that is attractive to the U.S government” and complements the strengths of MP Materials, the CEO said. “The government cannot bet on one horse — it just doesn’t make sense,” Chalmers said. “We spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy,” he said. # Trump eyes lithium Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications.

806,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace?-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\* There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home. **IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatis...[Content truncated]",Reddit

(NASDAQ:NB) is a North American critical minerals company focused on advancing one of the most strategically important mining projects in the United States. Headquartered in Centennial, Colorado, the company is developing the Elk Creek Project in southeast Nebraska, a fully permitted underground mine with the potential to become a leading domestic source of niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earth elements. These critical materials are essential to clean energy technologies, aerospace and defense applications, and advanced manufacturing, making NioCorp a pivotal player in strengthening supply chain security for the U.S. and its allies. The company’s roots trace back to its vision of reducing America’s dependence on foreign imports of strategic minerals. With the Elk Creek Project, NioCorp is positioned to deliver multiple products from a single site, offering a diversified revenue model across high-demand sectors. Niobium, a key focus of the project, is used to produce High Strength, Low Alloy steel, which is stronger and lighter than conventional steel and critical to automotive, infrastructure, and pipeline industries. Scandium, another major output, is combined with aluminum to form alloys that improve strength, reduce weight, and enhance corrosion resistance, while also being a vital component of solid oxide fuel cells. Titanium is widely used in aerospace, medical implants, and pigments for paper, plastics, and paints, further broadening the project’s commercial reach. In addition, NioCorp is assessing its capacity to produce magnetic rare earth elements, including neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium, which are indispensable for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced defense technologies. A significant differentiator for NioCorp is its advanced permitting status. Unlike many junior mining companies that struggle with regulatory hurdles, the Elk Creek Project has already secured all major permits required for construction and operation. This achievement dramatically reduces development risk and shortens the timeline to production. NioCorp has also signed binding offtake agreements that cover roughly 75 percent of its planned niobium output, in addition to securing the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, offering long-term market validation for its products. These agreements ensure that the company has secured customers well before entering production, providing a level of commercial certainty rare in the development stage of mining projects. The Elk Creek Project is further strengthened by strong support from local, state, and federal stakeholders. The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded funding to NioCorp in recognition of the project’s importance to national security, and the company has applied for $800 million in debt financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank. These government partnerships highlight the strategic role NioCorp plays in advancing America’s critical minerals independence, especially as global geopolitical tensions increase concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities. Led by Chairman, President, and CEO Mark Smith, NioCorp’s management team brings decades of experience in mining, engineering, and rare earth development. Under this leadership, the company has advanced the Elk Creek Project from exploration to a fully permitted, development-ready project with robust economics and a projected 38-year mine life. The combination of technical expertise, financial discipline, and industry relationships positions NioCorp as one of the most credible companies in the critical minerals sector. With global demand for clean energy, advanced alloys, and rare earth magnets accelerating, NioCorp Developments Ltd. stands at the forefront of a new era in mining and materials. Its Elk Creek Project is poised not only to generate long-term shareholder value but also to become a cornerstone in rebuilding domestic supply chains for minerals that are fundamental to modern technology and national security. # National Spotlight Through Bloomberg TV and RedChip NioCorp Developments Ltd. has recently been thrust into the national spotlight with its feature on the RedChip Small Stocks Big Money™ show airing on Bloomberg TV. With Bloomberg reaching an estimated 73 million households across the United States, this appearance represents a significant opportunity for NioCorp to share its story directly with a broad investor audience. Mark Smith, Chairman, President, and CEO of NioCorp, used this platform to discuss the company’s Elk Creek Project in Nebraska, a fully permitted $1.14 billion underground critical minerals mine. This project is one of the most advanced and strategically important initiatives in the North American mining sector, designed to supply metals essential to clean energy, aerospace, automotive, and defense industries. The media coverage not only validates NioCorp’s position in the market but also provides a catalyst for increasing awareness among retail and institutional investors. [Elk Creek: A Strategic U.S. Critical Minerals Project](https://reddit.com/link/1nqxika/video/s5sk36gcdhrf1/player) # Elk Creek: A Strategic U.S. Critical Minerals Project The Elk Creek Project is the cornerstone of NioCorp’s bullish outlook. Located in Southeast Nebraska, this fully permitted mine is projected to produce niobium, scandium, titanium, and potentially rare earth oxides that are indispensable to modern technology and national security. Unlike many other junior mining companies that remain stuck in permitting phases or struggle with regulatory hurdles, NioCorp has already secured all major permits required to advance construction. This is a crucial advantage, as it significantly de-risks the project and shortens the timeline to production. What sets Elk Creek apart is its potential to establish the first true mine-to-market scandium supply chain in the United States. Scandium, though relatively obscure, is a powerful enabler in advanced materials, used in aluminum alloys to create stronger and lighter products. It is also critical in next-generation solid oxide fuel cells, giving it growing relevance in the clean energy economy. By securing the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, NioCorp has validated both the demand and commercial viability of its output, positioning itself as a pioneer in this niche but vital market. # Binding Offtake Agreements and Market Validation NioCorp has secured offtake agreements covering approximately 75 percent of its planned niobium output, a clear signal that industrial buyers are eager to lock in supply from the project. Niobium is essential for producing High Strength, Low Alloy (HSLA) steel, a lighter and stronger form of steel used across automotive, construction, and pipeline industries. With global infrastructure and electric vehicle production expanding, demand for niobium is expected to rise steadily. Beyond niobium, NioCorp’s scandium offtake agreement represents another milestone. It is the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, underscoring the company’s ability to commercialize its resources effectively. Together, these agreements reduce marketing risk and provide investors with confidence that revenue streams are already secured even before the mine begins full-scale operations. This kind of market validation is rare among junior developers and strengthens the bullish thesis considerably. # Robust Economics, Long Mine Life, and Government Support NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is backed by robust economics, including a projected 38-year mine life that ensures decades of potential revenue generation. Long-life assets with diversified metal output are highly attractive in the mining sector, as they provide resilience against commodity price cycles. Furthermore, the company is leveraging strong support from state, local, and federal stakeholders, which further enhances its execution prospects. The U.S. Department of Defense has already recognized the strategic value of NioCorp’s project by awarding grants, while the company has also applied for an $800 million loan with the U.S. Export-Import Bank to finance construction. Such endorsements highlight how central NioCorp’s project is to U.S. national interests, particularly in reducing dependence on foreign sources for critical minerals. With growing geopolitical tensions and concerns about resource security, companies like NioCorp are strategically positioned to benefit from government initiatives and subsidies aimed at reshoring supply chains. # A Management Team With Proven Expertise Leadership is another important factor in building investor confidence, and NioCorp’s management team brings decades of experience in mining, rare earth development, and critical minerals. Under Mark Smith’s guidance, the company has advanced from exploration into a fully permitted development-stage project with offtake agreements in place. Smith and his team’s track record of navigating regulatory processes, securing partnerships, and engaging with investors gives credibility to the company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans. # Expanding Into Rare Ea...[Content truncated]",Reddit

Professor Samuel, who was Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman from 2003 to 2011 and led reviews for both Labor and the Coalition into environment law, defence controls and supermarkets, said the Albanese government must “numb the political nerve and the special pleadings that are coming from vested interests”. The Monash University Business School academic and former National Competition Council president also cited political consideration as a motivation behind the federal and South Australian governments’ $2.4bn taxpayer-funded rescue package for the Whyalla steelworks. Since the Prime Minister rolled out his big-spending [Future Made in Australia vehicle](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/pms-green-dream-future-is-vanishing-into-thin-air/news-story/76eddb0277653bba0867fc0f040acacf), which is underwriting investments that align with Labor’s policy agenda across clean energy, green metals, solar panels, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and rare earths, critics have accused the government of picking winners. Amid a growing push by countries across the globe to subsidise clean energy, defence and critical minerals production, Professor Samuel told The Australian: “National security is the latest rage … it used to be about energy and climate change … and now it’s national security they’ve caught on to. I’m hoping that what’s coming out of all the roundtables, and what’s coming out of Chalmers’ statements, is that he’s really saying to industry, ‘look, enough is enough … the budget doesn’t allow for it’. Anthony Albanese on Thursday. Picture: NewsWire / Valeriu Campan “Those making special pleadings are touching upon a political nerve, but the government is in extraordinarily fortunate, and almost unprecedented position, that the political nerve can be numbed. They should say; “we’ve got 94 seats now in the House of Representatives, we don’t need to be doing this anymore’. So my urgings to government would be to say, numb the political nerve and the special pleadings that are coming from vested interests.” Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood last year warned that Future Made in Australia subsidies and incentives would come at a cost and divert investment from more productive parts of the economy. Professor Samuel endorsed Dr Chalmers’ questions of industry and other stakeholders ahead of the roundtable about “who’s going to pay” for various proposals being put to government. The former ACCC boss said if he had any influence over the Whyalla Steelworks bailout decision he would have said “just stop”. “A lot of that is political as well,” he said. “It’s South Australia and certain seats. We had this with (former Liberal prime minister Scott) Morrison and Western Australia,” he said. The Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund on Thursday announced a $50m equity investment stake in the Gina Rinehart-backed Liontown Resources to support lithium production at the company’s Kathleen Valley operation in Western Australia. As Dr Chalmers continued his “boardroom blitz” on Thursday,[ Mr Albanese categorically ruled out any new tax changes](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/actu-calls-for-25bn-in-fair-tax-redistribution-of-productivity-gains/news-story/ae7091d20008cc7bf47292d5386f9275) during his second-term of government. Speaking in Melbourne, the Prime Minister said “governments make government policy, and … the only tax policy that we’re implementing is the one that we took to the election”, referring to reducing incomes taxes from July 1 next year. Treasurer Jim Chalmers. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood. Picture: John Feder Ahead of another round of meetings on Friday, Dr Chalmers met private sector leaders in Sydney on Thursday including BHP Australia president Geraldine Slattery, Business Council of Australia president Geoff Culbert, Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott, Rio Tinto chief executive Kellie Parker, Mirvac chief executive Campbell Hanan, ­Google Australia managing director Mel Silva, Gilbert+Tobin chair Danny Gilbert, GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway, ­Cochlear chief executive Dig ­Howitt, AirTrunk chief executive Robin Khuda and BCA chief executive Bran Black. The Australian understands that business leaders have been told the roundtable will not be a launching pad for sweeping tax ­reforms pushed by the unions and others. However, the government is expected to focus discussions heavily on addressing “intergenerational equity”, which will likely drive new tax policies ahead of the 2028 election. Treasury issues papers released on Thursday – described by Dr Chalmers as “deliberately flat and factual” – outlined the ­government’s agenda for the three-day summit, to be held at Parliament House from August 19 to 21. Included in the resilience, productivity and budget sustainability and tax reform issues ­papers were references to the ­implications of the current tax ­system and public spending on productivity and “intergenerational equity”. In the wake of Treasury’s post-election warnings to Dr Chalmers that he would need to lower spending and increase taxes to maintain a sustainable budget, the government is under pressure to pursue new tax measures and ­address concerns about negative gearing, GST, capital gains tax, company tax rates, and the need for road user charges. Treasury’s budget sustainability and tax reform issues paper warned that the return to deficits was fuelled by higher spending and lower revenue. “The budget is forecast to continue to be in deficit over the forward estimates by an average of 1.2 per cent of GDP,” the paper said. The seven “key structural spending pressures on the budget” were listed as interest costs growing by 9.5 per cent a year over the medium term. the NDIS, defence spending, hospital funding, Medicare, aged care, and childcare. “The tax system is under pressure from demographic and economic shifts, and its design is critical to productivity, budget sustainability and intergenerational equity,” the issues paper said. “Structural changes to the economy, including an ageing population and the transition to net-zero, are expected to change the composition of the revenue base. “The share of indirect taxes will fall, as the decarbonisation of the transport industry and changing consumer preferences erode the fuel and tobacco excise bases. This will increase reliance on the income tax base, which is expected to comprise an increasing share of total tax receipts.” The Treasurer said the issues papers had been released now “so we can spend time at the roundtable on specific ideas not just problem identification”. The Productivity Commission’s interim report on the national competition policy reforms inquiry, released on Thursday night, estimated that harmonising standards across all jurisdictions and aligning them to those that existed internationally would be worth more than $15bn over the forward estimates, or up to $3.8bn a year. The commission identified three main benefits from such a move: lower compliance costs ­incurred by businesses, lower ­administrative costs for government and the increase of products designed overseas to be sold in Australia. “Greater (product) range would imply consumer welfare gains from greater competition, lower prices and greater product diversity, productivity gains,” the report stated. The commission said 21 mandated standards were not aligned with international standards, while a further 169 had no existing counterpart overseas. “Despite the small number of internationally unaligned standards, these standards can create trade barriers when mandated,” it said. The commission reiterated its call for a road user charge, which Dr Chalmers has nominated as a reform priority that would help abate falling fuel excise. Graeme Samuel has urged the Albanese government to stop big-spending industry subsidies and tell companies seeking handouts that ‘enough is enough’.",Reddit

810,Global,2021-03,"AbraSilver: one billion dollar Silver Junior in the making-Silver Junior with **proven** resource, **PEA** study and ongoing **exploration** program AbraSilver (former Abraplata) has been in our portfolio since 18 months. ticker **$ABRA.v** or **$ABBRF** Our buy price was 9 cents. At a certain point, my initial investment **went down 61% to 3.5 cents**. 18 months later, those who bought at the lows are up 1500%, a 15 bagger. Back then, my due diligence and knowlegde on Juniors was not the level it is now. My main expertise is timing a Silver bull and bear market. Abraplata had a 140M oz resource, which would be a guaranteed winner if we entered a bull market. That’s how it all begun. I didn’t know more about the company as the ounces and the valuation per ounce, back then barely 3M Mcap. This simple math is copied mostly by amateur investors. 18 months later, i know better: A **strong management team**, a **good shareholder** structure, continious deliver or **outperforming expectations** and **hard work** is what matters, combined with a bit of luck. The question we are asking today what are the triggers for more value creation in the next 18 months after such a nice run? At AbraSilver, **i see plenty**. Let me explain in more dept. First, look at the recent financings, dating from summer 2020. AbraSilver did 3 financings in very short order near the top of $30 Silver in June-August 2020: that’s something i can admire, **a great sense of timing**, avoiding dilution for shareholders.3+5+15 million, and is as such now **funded untill construction decision** (!) (18M in the bank) for: - finalising 13.000m program - phase II drilling - 2 drill rigs keep going - update of the resource (!) - PEA study - feasibility study. Top 3 Shareholders: Eric Sprott, Altius Minerals and SSR Mining own 37% of all outstanding shares, **total insiders are at 43%** While some might argue there are a lot of warrants out, in the case of AbraSilver it brings money in the bank here avoiding new financings. All shares are free trading and this is reflected by a huge consolidation pattern since summer 2020: a smaller cup &amp; handle inside a bigger cup &amp; handle. Weak hands taking profits early have been shifted to strong hands. Yes, the longterm chart looks very bullish, **a giant four year cup &amp; handle**, and we are about to take out all time highs, with no old sellers left. Whent here is **no chart resistance**, stocks can really fly after such a long base. So from a technical point of view, it looks lovely. Now we come to the asset, which was the reason for my initial investment. I am now talking about the old resource (not updated since 2018) What i love about **Diablillos** (based in **Salta** Argentina, top 4 most attractive jurisdictions in Latin America) it has no base metals, and it’s a **pure Silver-Gold deposit**, the last outdated resource update shows 140Moz AgEq or in Gold 1.7Moz AuEq. **156 g/t AgEq - very high for open pit, so cheap mining.** **60% of the resource is comprised of silver**, providing significant leverage to rising silver price Diabllilos average oxide grades of 2.1 g/t AuEq is **2.5x higher than comparable oxide projects** in the Americas….and expected to increase further. Let’s talk about **the old PEA from 2018.** This is an economic study about a potential mine. for every dollar increase in Silver or $100 in Gold, the value creation is **$60 million** remember, that doesn’t include any of last years drill intercepts. The 2018 study envisages an open pit with a 6000tpd plant **producing 9.8 Moz AgEq per year** Now realize for example First Majestic, is producing 21 Moz AqEq per year. The production at Abra would be very low-cost open pit: **average all-in sustaining cost per ounce of US$7.52/oz AgEq** The 2018 PEA production study is comparable to that of intermediate silver producers (avg. 12MM oz/year AgEq) that have **an average market cap of C$1.7 Billion.** Summarized, **based on all the old information, at current Silver prices** **my target is $1.8/share.** Now what **are triggers from the more recent drilling results** in the last 18 months? this timeline of newsflow explains 2021 is a BIG year for AbraSilver. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/anqdryh3pdn61.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=685c3cb567671055f59727b08d208a98f7d27d9c After this drill program at Diablillos, we can expect **a new resource estimate as soon as the next quarter**. How much the old one at 140Moz will grow, is anybody’s guess. My estimate is we could see a 20% increase on this summer update, but perhaps a lot more. And, it still remains open for further expansion. \*\*The final deposit could be closer to 250Moz, the size of San Dimas First Majestic.\*\*Or a 1+ billion valuation at current Silver prices. With that new reource estimate, **a new PEA will be released later around mid 2021**, and a follow-up drill program, again at Diablillos. I expect all this to happen while #silver goes from 25 to $50. **Beyond explosive isn’t it ?** Rio Tinto drilling a join venture project with Abra at Arcas Chile is just icing on the cake. Yes, Abra owns 4 other assets and they have a join venture with Rio so expect newsflow also from that side. As most of you know: **a continous newsflow is important** to create strong hands in a share, and it's something a lot of juniors struggle at. Summing up, $ABRA.v has a lot of rerate triggers even here at this Mcap. Some junior investors make the mistake **selling out early** to be invested again in nanocaps all the time. Once they grow big, they bail. The current 6-7 biggest picks in our Silver Sitfolio have the qualities of being a target for multibillion companies. **These are the kind of assets that might get valued sky high at $100 silver in a bidding war.** Size and derisked matters. This graph shows why Abra is a very strong M&amp;A target in terms of size. https://preview.redd.it/hmebgy9npdn61.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e48d5909415aa3e68ac2f739242edb3df4ea48 When a buyout scenario is likely, this is not the pick you want to take profits on.It can happen at any time further down the road, when the new PEA is published. This week we had 3 M&amp;A activities at a 50% premium. Now i hope it doesn't happen in the next 3 months before the big updates, it's definitely a reason to **just buy and hold.** Notice a second reason is as an investor, i don’t get married to a position but if the value proposition stays intact, nothing gives more satisfaction than seeing your company grow from almost unknown/nothing to massive. **It’s a lifechanging journey, and in case of Abraplata, a 100+ bagger journey.** chek the full PF here [https://www.goldventures.org/blog/silver-sitfolio](https://www.goldventures.org/blog/silver-sitfolio) &amp;#x200B; want more?

811,Global,2025-05,"Uranium Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies in 2025 $BHP $CCJ $NXE $UEC $DNN-What are the largest uranium companies in the world? Here's a breakdown of the biggest uranium stocks producing and exploring for the nuclear fuel. https://preview.redd.it/l7p15e8di63f1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a58f93e19ae7aec7402eef715c951310105584f9 **After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals. While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter. “As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/). As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. “Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.” \*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) **Market cap:** US$128.63 billion Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver. In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline. The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. **2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO) **Market cap:** US$23.2 billion Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations. Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery. Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022. As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023. In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake. After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year. **3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG) **Market cap:** US$3.18 billion NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery. The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF). In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million. The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones. In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth. **4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC) **Market cap:** US$2.36 billion Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025. The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve. UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO). In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois. In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform. Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December. In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security. **5.

812,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace?-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II**. Erosion of Our Freedoms** There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance.

813,Global,2025-07,"Ken Henry’s plan for tax reform, economic growth and easing climate change-# Ken Henry’s plan for tax reform, economic growth and easing climate change The former Treasury secretary failed to have a previous Labor government implement a resources super profits tax, but he has plenty of big ideas for tax reform. By Jennifer Hewett 5 min. readView original It was coincidental timing that [Simon Trott’s ascension](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/rio-tinto-names-iron-ore-division-chief-simon-trott-as-next-ceo-20250715-p5mf43) from heading Rio Tinto’s iron ore division to becoming CEO overlaps with echoes of the ill-fated resource rent tax. That came in the form of a National Press Club address by former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, whose name is still synonymous with the resource super profits tax he proposed as part of his wide-ranging review of Australia’s tax system 15 years ago. Ken Henry at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday – he said an economy-wide carbon tax was needed and may happen eventually. AAP Most of Henry’s other recommendations were ignored – one reason for the tax system’s inefficient, cumbersome inadequacy today. But [Henry, now chair of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation,](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/fix-green-laws-before-tax-to-create-growth-ken-henry-20250715-p5mf04) remains a passionate advocate for broad tax reform – including addressing the pernicious impact of high personal income tax rates on younger generations. So a certain political resonance was felt when Jim Chalmers said he had consulted Henry on the treasurer’s big speech last month promoting Labor’s second-term economic reform ambitions, including tax. Chalmers is familiar with the failure of the resources super profits tax, given he was a senior adviser to then treasurer Wayne Swan when the issue flared. The bitter opposition of the West Australian government and the iron ore industry to the idea of a federal resource tax in 2010 quickly led to Labor’s beheading of Kevin Rudd as prime minister in his first term. It’s also true that despite some ups and downs for the industry, the super profits of the massive expansion of WA’s iron ore exports and resilient prices have greatly assisted successive federal governments and their budgets ever since. Iron ore is still helping to fill much of the big budget hole created by the Albanese government’s spending, for example, as well as paying enough royalties to keep the WA government flush with cash. Yet the Albanese government is obviously looking for more tax revenue from somewhere, given federal spending is growing at 6 per cent in real terms this financial year and national economic growth is so sluggish. Henry has strongly promoted a carbon tax applied to Australia’s fossil fuel exports of coal and gas, for example, arguing this could raise $50 billion a year. That would agitate much of the coal and gas industry in a replay of the political furore over the resources rent tax, making it unlikely Chalmers would take the risk. That’s even if Henry remains keen for an economy-wide carbon tax, telling the Press Club it is needed and may happen eventually. “In the meantime we have something else and we’ve got to make the something else work, right?” he said on Wednesday. That something else, in his strong view, includes the need to fix complex environmental regulations and laws as a priority to help improve Australia’s dismal productivity record and as a model for improving state-federal co-operation. # Miners’ concern delays and restrictions That’s a goal actually shared by the mining industry these days, as long as new environmental laws don’t end up worsening delays and restrictions, translating into lesser progress for the economy, as well as the environment. Fear of just this happening led to the West Australian government persuading Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to drop plans to proceed with environmental legislation ahead of the last election. Labor will have another go at it this term, including establishing a federal environmental agency. The mining industry will be cautiously willing to co-operate to get a difficult balance right. Henry’s suggestion at the Press Club that a climate trigger should at least be considered as part of a revised Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will keep many miners on alert. But these days they will back his argument on the need for greater efficiency and speed in approving projects like new mines and associated infrastructure. The new regard in environmental circles for the development of critical minerals and more transmission lines for the energy transition creates common cause that once seemed improbable. The iron ore industry’s other goals for decarbonisation should also be more closely aligned with Henry’s stance on the need for urgent action to combat climate change. Iron ore miners are all working hard on trying to decarbonise mining operations, including extensive use of renewable energy like solar power. Not that Andrew Forrest’s industry competitors agree with the Fortescue founder’s push for an immediate end to the diesel fuel rebate when it is proving so difficult to electrify heavy trucks and green hydrogen projects are being dumped. Nor do they back Forrest’s bleak warnings that the Pilbara will turn into a wasteland without an urgent surge into a future of green iron – helped along by government subsidies. # Fears over green iron production Forrest argues that China, which sources 60 per cent of its iron ore imports from Australia, will shift to other countries with higher-grade ores unless the industry changes radically. Trott told the Australian Financial Review Mining Summit in May that people had predicted the end of the Pilbara’s iron ore industry numerous times. “Each time the industry has adapted and responded, and I’ve got no doubt that’s going to continue,” he said in response to Forrest. But BHP, Rio Tinto and Hancock Iron Ore are far more sceptical about the viability of producing green iron at scale or affordable cost. That’s even though BHP, Rio and BlueScope Steel are co-operating in the NeoSmelt project, a $215 million facility in Perth that is expected to produce up to 40,000 tonnes of low-emissions iron when it begins in 2028. They still maintain the biggest reduction in carbon emissions from steelmaking will not come from reinventing iron ore mining but from technological advances in China’s ageing blast furnaces. Promoting greater co-operation with the Chinese steel industry on decarbonisation worked well for the joint appearance of executives from BHP, Rio, Hancock and Fortescue alongside the prime minister in China this week. It just doesn’t fit neatly with the Albanese government’s obsession with more green metals manufacturing being done in Australia. It’s still a reminder of how much has changed in Australia’s iron ore industry since the Henry tax review. What comes next?",Reddit

815,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\* There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI.

Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII.

817,Global,2025-05,"Uranium Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies in 2025 $BHP $CCJ $NXE $UEC $DNN-What are the largest uranium companies in the world? Here's a breakdown of the biggest uranium stocks producing and exploring for the nuclear fuel. https://preview.redd.it/25q8qwd47y1f1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8c1c817b05160121046405db6fabad4ef66ebdd **After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals. While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter. “As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/). As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. “Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.” **1. BHP (**NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) **Market cap:** US$128.63 billion Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver. In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline. The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. **2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO) **Market cap:** US$23.2 billion Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations. Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery. Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022. As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023. In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake. After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year. **3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG) **Market cap:** US$3.18 billion NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery. The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF). In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million. The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones. In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth. **4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC) **Market cap:** US$2.36 billion Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025. The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve. UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO). In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois. In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform. Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December. In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security. **5.

818,Global,2025-05,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace?-The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace? Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II**. Erosion of Our Freedoms** There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home. **IX.

819,Global,2025-05,"Uranium Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies in 2025 $BHP $CCJ $NXE $UEC $DNN-What are the largest uranium companies in the world? Here's a breakdown of the biggest uranium stocks producing and exploring for the nuclear fuel. https://preview.redd.it/v1bhgfi67y1f1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de0cdb67ae6e1d33374aa98c737ccd58a4970275 **After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals. While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter. “As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/). As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. “Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.” **1. BHP (**NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) **Market cap:** US$128.63 billion Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver. In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline. The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. **2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO) **Market cap:** US$23.2 billion Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations. Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery. Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022. As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023. In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake. After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year. **3.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO). In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois. In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform. Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December. In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security. **5.

823,Global,2025-05,"Uranium Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies in 2025 $BHP $CCJ $NXE $UEC $DNN-What are the largest uranium companies in the world? Here's a breakdown of the biggest uranium stocks producing and exploring for the nuclear fuel. https://preview.redd.it/sehcz6qci63f1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdf6968b6f63c694bf33494d4060c3fbd3f57d22 **After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals. While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter. “As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/). As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. “Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.” \*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) **Market cap:** US$128.63 billion Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver. In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline. The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. **2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO) **Market cap:** US$23.2 billion Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations. Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery. Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022. As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023. In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake. After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year. **3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG) **Market cap:** US$3.18 billion NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery. The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF). In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million. The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones. In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth. **4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC) **Market cap:** US$2.36 billion Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025. The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake. After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year. **3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG) **Market cap:** US$3.18 billion NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery. The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF). In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million. The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones. In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth. **4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC) **Market cap:** US$2.36 billion Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025. The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve. UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO). In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois. In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform. Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December. In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security. **5.

827,Global,2025-05,"Uranium Stocks: 5 Biggest Companies in 2025 $BHP $CCJ $NXE $UEC $DNN-What are the largest uranium companies in the world? Here's a breakdown of the biggest uranium stocks producing and exploring for the nuclear fuel. https://preview.redd.it/zz32oj0et42f1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=850323517f3f54c26e21e162ce051f2682868499 **After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals. While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter. “As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/). As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. “Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.” \*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) **Market cap:** US$128.63 billion Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver. In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline. The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill. **2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO) **Market cap:** US$23.2 billion Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations. Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery. Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022. As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023. In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar.

""surely we can sacrifice one square, right?"" but it's never like that. you can't just dig a huge hole in the ground and not have it create huge consequences. heck, a friend of mine had a neighbor who cleared his lot of trees. guess what - she gets loads more water coming through her land now because there are no longer trees holding that water at the neighbor's lot. and we live in an area that's already quite rainy, so more water can be a huge problem. the neighbor probably thought that he was just doing something in his one square of the game board, but nature doesn't know anything about imaginary property lines. it's all interconnected. anyway if anyone has any tips on talking to people about anti-extractivism, please let me know because i'm struggling. also, for anyone who's interested, here are a couple documentaries that helped me arrive at my current anti-extractivist stance: * [the coconut revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sl8KJDOqK4) - about the people of the island of bougainville island who successfully kicked out rio tinto, but ended up with a civil war and eight year blockade. they had to figure out how to live with what was on their island while also dealing with this massive hole created by mining. * [aluna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftFbCwJfs1I) - documentary with the kogi people of south america where they show all the unintended consequences that came from changes that were made to the land by people who thought that they were ""just building some houses"" or ""just clearing some land"". this doc really showed me how all building/construction projects - even ones with environmental review - have huge amounts of unintended consequences that the ones doing the building absolutely do not consider ahead of time.",Reddit

Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity. The unfiltered truth is laid out below. **I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen** Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living. II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\* There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates. **III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket** Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy. **IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets** Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives. **V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation** Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate. **VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable** Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance.

Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people. **VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative** A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite. **VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart** The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home. **IX.

The move follows Beijing’s announcement of export restrictions on rare earths, marking an escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to initiate an investigation into critical minerals, potentially leading to additional tariffs on industrial resources. The move follows recent probes into chip and pharmaceutical imports, signalling a further broadening of the global trade war. The investigation, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, aims to “determine the effects on national security of imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products,” according to the official document. “Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical production inputs required for economic and national security.” The same law was previously used by Trump to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, as well as to launch a probe into copper imports. Last month, the president signed an executive order to boost domestic production of critical minerals by invoking the Defence Production Act, providing support such as financing and loans to the sector. The measure is widely seen as targeting China, which dominates the global supply chain. # Trump’s strategic approach to leverage US power in the trade war with China According to the White House, the US relies on imports of 15 critical minerals, 70% of which originate from China. Last Friday, Beijing announced export restrictions on a wide range of critical minerals, such as germanium, gallium, antimony, and magnets, in response to Trump’s sharp tariff hikes.

Last Friday, Beijing announced export restrictions on a wide range of critical minerals, such as germanium, gallium, antimony, and magnets, in response to Trump’s sharp tariff hikes. The US has only one rare earth mine and no domestic smelters, leaving it heavily reliant on China for natural resources, including rare earths and critical minerals—vital components in electric devices, battery-powered vehicles, aircraft, and defence equipment. A TD Economics report reveals that China dominates the global production of more than half of the 50 critical minerals identified by the US government in 2022. It also maintains a near-monopoly in refining, processing 90% of global rare earth elements. To strengthen its hand in the trade war, the US will need to diversify sourcing of these industrial materials. “Processed critical minerals and their derivative products face significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers,” Tuesday’s investigation document states, “The dependence of the United States on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defence readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience.” In February, Trump demanded $500 billion (€442 billion) worth of Ukraine’s rare earth and critical minerals as part of peace talks, a move also seen as a strategic effort to enhance the US’s position against China. # Market responses Australia’s major mining stocks fell during Wednesday’s Asian session, with shares of BHP falling 1.2%, Rio Tinto sliding 2.3%, and Phibara Minerals dropping 2.9% as of 5:52 am CEST. In commodities, iron ore (CFR China) futures on the SGX declined 0.35%, while copper futures fell 0.91%. The downturn in the resource sector may also be linked to reports that Nvidia is facing new US export restrictions to China, which could cost the tech giant billions of dollars. These fresh regulations are expected to dampen demand for industrial resources such as copper and certain critical minerals used in chip manufacturing. Combined with Trump’s latest probe, the news has contributed to broader market weakness. European markets may soon feel the ripple effects of the intensifying global trade war, with stock futures pointing to a lower open across major indices. # APRIL 16th, 2025 ~China restricts exports of rare earth minerals in retaliation against Trump's tariffs [China restricts exports of rare earth minerals in retaliation against Trump's tariffs | WXXI News](https://www.wxxinews.org/2025-04-16/china-restricts-exports-of-rare-earth-minerals-in-retaliation-against-trumps-tariffs) China is retaliating against U.S. tariffs by restricting exports of rare earth minerals.

In a move to strengthen North America's supply of advanced aerospace materials, APWORKS, an Airbus subsidiary specializing in metal 3D printing, and Equispheres, a Canadian aluminum powder producer, have partnered to establish regional production of Scalmalloy, a high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy engineered for additive manufacturing. Developed for laser powder bed fusion and critical applications demanding strength, weldability, and corrosion resistance, Scalmalloy bridges the gap between traditional aerospace-grade metals and next-generation manufacturing technologies. Until now, the alloy's availability has been largely limited to Europe and Asia, creating supply challenges for North American manufacturers looking to accelerate additive production. Eliminating one of the final barriers to adoption, the newest partnership will see Equispheres produce Scalmalloy powder optimized for 3D printing from primarily domestic raw materials – a move designed to support aerospace, defense, and industrial users seeking faster, more reliable access to high-performance alloys. The company's proprietary powder technology, designed for high uniformity and print speed without compromising mechanical integrity, will bring new scalability to a material prized for its combination of strength and lightweight performance. ""Scalmalloy will be a great addition to our line of high-performance materials for serial additive manufacturing,"" said Equispheres CEO Kevin Nicholds. ""North American supply of critical materials such as aluminum-scandium alloys is a key step toward securing the aerospace supply chain."" Long overlooked due to its scattered distribution, scandium remains difficult to produce at scale despite being more abundant in Earth's crust than lead – a constraint that has kept global output low and supply chains heavily dependent on Chinese, Russian, and Kazakh sources. [New recovery efforts in Canada](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/09/16/critical-minerals-alliances-2024/north-america-fortifies-scandium-supply/1936.html), however, are beginning to shift that balance – momentum that partnerships like APWORKS and Equispheres are now positioned to accelerate. ""Equispheres is a logical choice for expanding Scalmalloy production into North America,"" said APWORKS CEO Jonathan Meyer. ""Their expertise in producing high-quality aluminum powders for additive manufacturing, combined with access to domestic aluminum and scandium sources, positions them well for building supply chain resilience."" [A bionic cabin partition created by Airbus, Autodesk, and APWORKS illustrates how Scalmalloy and generative design deliver lightweight, load-bearing aerospace structures.](https://preview.redd.it/x35ytjhojyxe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65646d5a23cb94fbc68d73302eb5637ae516932) Beyond raw availability, domestic production of Scalmalloy streamlines qualification and part certification processes by reducing lead times and material variability – factors that often limit implementation in regulated aerospace and defense systems. Powder produced to North American specifications can be aligned more directly with design, testing, and production schedules. Equispheres' process yields spherical, size-controlled powder engineered for consistent flow and packing density. These properties support faster build rates, reduced defect occurrence, and tighter dimensional accuracy – factors essential to scaling metal additive manufacturing in aerospace, propulsion, and satellite component production. As global supply chains evolve to prioritize regional production of strategic materials, the APWORKS–Equispheres partnership aligns with broader Western initiatives to secure alloy inputs for aircraft, defense platforms, and industrial systems. Scalmalloy's entry into North American production adds a flight-proven, data-supported material to the region's additive manufacturing infrastructure. Already validated in Formula 1 racing and aerospace prototypes, Scalmalloy delivers the structural performance – high tensile strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion durability – required for next-generation manufacturing. # REVIEW OF YESTERDAY'S APRIL 29th, PRESENTATION NIOCORP NAMED A ""FLAGSHIP"" DOMESTIC CRITICAL MINERALS Project. ***Mark Smith stating: The Administration &amp; Pentagon ""SEE &amp; are aware of Niocorp &amp; 'Want to move quickly!""*** ***See for yourself:*** # [Microsoft Virtual Events Powered by Teams](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/e812a744-f257-4470-8f5c-2bac41063c77@17934c82-3f5c-4fe1-8ae2-75bee4d8acbb?vod&amp;attendeeId=a702009a-4bcf-4921-810c-cf0b37af7fe9) https://preview.redd.it/psd6mgz2lyxe1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9613253e85e1e84b68acd0b47a76592e5d827e1b # SCANDIUM IS A GAMECHANGER MOVING FORWARD.

834,Global,2025-03,"NOA Lithium Insider Clean Elements’ Buying Signals Confidence as Lithium Demand Set to Surge (TSXV: NOAL.V)-New Coverage of the Company. Available online here: https://thefinanceherald.com/noa-lithium-brines-insider-buying-signals-confidence-as-global-lithium-demand-set-to-surge/ # NOA Lithium Insider Clean Elements’ Buying Signals Confidence as Lithium Demand Set to Surge In a strong vote of confidence for NOA Lithium Brines Inc. (TSXV: NOAL)*, Clean Elements Ltd., led by Chairman Ofer Amir, has increased its position in the company through a market purchase completed on March 13, 2025, according to recent insider filings. “After witnessing the progress of the project and the market evolution, we wanted to invest the full US$ 10M. We just received approval from the Canadian regulator and from NOA to acquire US$500k at market price. This is a strong commitment from our original investment at 17 cents and now at 35 cents”, Ofer Amir said. The transaction, disclosed in SEDI filings on March 17, represents continued investment by Clean Elements, which became a strategic investor in NOA Lithium in late 2024. This latest purchase reinforces Clean Elements’ commitment to NOA’s development plans and confidence in the company’s lithium assets. This move comes at a pivotal time for the lithium sector, with industry forecasts projecting global lithium demand to more than double by 2030. According to a Future Market Insights report published in January 2025, analysts estimate the market will require approximately 52 new lithium mines globally, each capable of producing 30,000 tonnes per annum, primarily driven by accelerating EV adoption and grid-scale energy storage deployments. Strategic Positioning in the Lithium Triangle “We continue to see tremendous value in NOA Lithium’s strategic position in Argentina’s Salta Province,” said Ofer Amir, Chairman of Clean Elements, in an exclusive interview. “With the completion of property acquisitions at Rio Grande and a world-class resource of 4.7 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, NOA has established itself as one of the most promising development-stage lithium companies in the highly coveted Lithium Triangle.” NOA’s flagship Rio Grande project features an impressive average lithium concentration of 525 mg/L, placing it among high-concentration projects with substantial economic potential in the region. The company recently completed the acquisition of all properties within its Rio Grande project, significantly de-risking its development pathway. “This latest investment reflects our long-term commitment to NOA and our confidence in both the company’s assets and management team,” Amir added. “The fundamentals of the lithium market are exceptionally strong, particularly against the backdrop of the rapidly accelerating battery storage market. With battery storage expected to represent 15-25% of total lithium demand, and the tremendous growth projections for the sector, we see a very compelling future for lithium.” Positioning for Exponential Market Growth The insider buying demonstrates strategic foresight as lithium consumption is projected to experience a fast rate of aproximatly 15-25% between 2025-2035, with market value expected to reach USD 16 billion in 2025 based on the estimated demand of 1.5 million metric tonnes and the current prices of lithium. Experts anticipate the market will shift from current conditions to a significant supply deficit by the end of the decade, driving renewed interest in high-quality development assets. Rising Global Demand Amid Supply Constraints NOA’s development progress coincides with accelerating global demand for lithium, primarily driven by electric vehicle production and ESS (Energy Storage Systems). According to S&amp;P Global data, global plug-in electric vehicle sales reached 16.5 million units in 2024, a 28.5% increase from the previous year. The EV market seems to be approaching a critical tipping point, with new models achieving price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles while offering approximately 80% lower operating and maintenance costs. Recent technological breakthroughs are also addressing charging speed concerns, with China’s BYD unveiling a revolutionary new Super e-Platform on March 17, 2025. The platform’s flash-charge batteries support an unprecedented 10 C charging multiplier—the highest of any mass-produced power battery in the world—enabling a theoretical full charge in just six minutes. According to BYD, the system features charging voltages of up to 1,000 V and currents of up to 1,000 A, enabling charging power of 1,000 kW (1 megawatt), twice the peak power of Tesla’s latest V4 supercharger. China continues to lead this growth, accounting for 86% of the global increase in EV sales in 2024 according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights data released in February 2025. The country recently doubled nationwide EV subsidies, and has nearly tripled its lithium reserves, making it the second-largest holder worldwide behind Australia. Meanwhile, the development timeline for new lithium mines remains challenging, typically taking around 16 years from discovery to production. This supply constraint, coupled with surging demand, creates a favorable long-term outlook for established projects in mining-friendly jurisdictions like NOA’s portfolio in Argentina. Competitive Landscape NOA’s continued advancement places it in a strong position among lithium developers, particularly following Rio Tinto’s $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium in October 2024, which validated the premium valuations for quality lithium assets in the region. The lithium market is entering a phase of extraordinary growth. With the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimating a tenfold increase in lithium demand for batteries alone between 2020 and 2030, major automotive manufacturers and battery producers are aggressively securing sustainable, long-term supply. With a strengthened financial position following the Clean Elements investment, NOA continues to advance exploration and development activities across its 140,000-hectare portfolio, which includes the Rio Grande, Arizaro, and Salinas Grandes projects. The company plans to begin water exploration drilling at Rio Grande before the end of the first quarter of 2025, with engineering proposals for the project’s preliminary economic assessment currently under evaluation. This progress positions NOA to potentially become a significant contributor to global lithium supply as the market faces projected shortfalls later this decade. *Disclaimer: Nothing in this report constitutes financial or investment advice, nor does it represent an offer to buy or sell securities.

Development Progress: NOA continues to advance its flagship Rio Grande project toward a preliminary economic assessment (PEA) expected during second half of 2025. According to public statements, this assessment is anticipated to provide comprehensive economic valuation of the project's significant resource base. The Broader Market Perspective: Critical Lithium Supply Gap Amid Accelerating Demand The global lithium market is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by the accelerating transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Industry forecasts project global lithium demand to more than double by 2030, requiring the development of approximately 52 new lithium mines/plants globally able to produce 30,000 tpa each. This expansion is hindered by lengthy development timelines, complex permitting processes, and high capital requirements, creating a significant opportunity for advanced-stage projects like NOA's Rio Grande. The lithium supply-demand imbalance is particularly acute as major automotive manufacturers continue scaling up EV production. With each electric vehicle requiring between 30-100 kilograms of lithium (depending on size and battery capacity), the automotive sector alone is projected to consume over 1.5 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent annually by 2030. Energy storage applications add further pressure, with grid-scale battery installations growing at a CAGR of over 30%. NOA's brine-based projects in Argentina's Lithium Triangle offer significant advantages in this market context. Brine operations typically maintain production costs between $4,000-$6,000 per ton, compared to $10,000-$12,000 per ton for hard rock lithium mining. This cost advantage ensures profitability even during periods of price volatility, while providing superior margins during normal market conditions. The strategic importance of securing lithium supply has been highlighted by recent major industry transactions, including Rio Tinto's $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium. Such deals underscore the premium valuations assigned to quality lithium assets, particularly those in favorable jurisdictions with advanced development status. 2025: Pivotal Year for Growth NOA Lithium is preparing for continued development in 2025, with several potential milestones on the horizon: Advancement toward completion of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for Rio Grande, a key milestone in project development. Progress on water exploration at the Rio Grande project, as mentioned in the company's February 2025 corporate update. Continued evaluation of the company's additional salars at Arizaro and Salinas Grandes, which represent future growth opportunities within NOA's portfolio. The company's strong cash position following the Clean Elements investment provides runway to advance these initiatives while maintaining financial flexibility. Looking Ahead NOA Lithium stands at the forefront of addressing the critical global lithium supply gap, positioned strategically within one of the world's premier lithium-producing regions. With its substantial resource base, cost-advantaged brine operations, and experienced management team, NOA represents a compelling opportunity in the lithium development space. As global EV adoption accelerates and renewable energy storage deployments expand, securing sustainable lithium supply becomes increasingly strategic for manufacturers, battery producers, and governments alike. NOA's projects in Argentina's mining-friendly Salta Province offer a combination of scale, grade, and jurisdictional advantages that few peers can match. The company's continued project development and advancement toward economic assessment could provide greater visibility on the value of its substantial lithium resource. With the global lithium market projected to face supply challenges through 2030, NOA's assets position it to potentially benefit from favorable market fundamentals.

Of the 12 “strategic defense critical minerals” identified by [Silverado Policy Accelerator](https://silverado.org/data-dashboards/strategic-defense-critical-minerals-production-dashboard/) as posing the greatest risk to U.S. national security,^(1) China is the top producer of all but one (arsenic trioxide). Additionally, resource-rich nations like Australia, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of Congo produce much of the world’s “battery metals” like lithium, cobalt, graphite, manganese, copper, and nickel, but these raw materials are sent to China for processing, creating a supply chain bottleneck. This monopsonistic arrangement has allowed China to consolidate its power over global supply chains, a strategic advantage that is intrinsically aligned with its broader national security and geopolitical ambitions. https://preview.redd.it/9lxm4bp96die1.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972cacb30fdfcd81a825cb40036ed25d1d33f06c https://preview.redd.it/bgs5305c6die1.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d40948ad4d5702db2583fc8f3eba51c28b83c5b9 Although recent rollbacks in U.S. electric vehicle mandates may slightly temper demand for traditional market-driving minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, the overall demand for critical minerals remains [robust](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trumps-ev-rollback-not-expected-suppress-appetite-critical-minerals-2025-01-21/). Simultaneously, more niche minerals with limited market presence but immense importance to advanced technologies—such as gallium, germanium, and antimony—are subject to escalating supply pressures. Recent export bans by China have highlighted the U.S.’s acute dependence on foreign supply of these materials: 100% import-reliant for gallium, 50% for germanium, and 83% for antimony. With over half of U.S. imports for these minerals sourced directly from China—and even when importing from partner nations like Belgium, Germany, or Japan, there is often upstream [exposure](https://www.exiger.com/perspectives/weaponization-of-the-periodic-table-crimps-u-s-critical-minerals-supply-chains/#:~:text=Level%20Intelligence%2C%20Exiger-,How%20Are%20These%20Minerals%20Used?,through%20stibnite%20(Sb2S3)%20ore.) to China—supply chains remain vulnerable to strategic manipulation that could erode U.S. hegemony and military power. Addressing this challenge requires a nuanced approach, as each critical mineral has a unique value and supply chain. Some are byproducts of other industrial processes, others are routinely considered waste, or “tailings,” in commercially viable operations (e.g., antimony alongside gold and tantalum/niobium with tin), and many traverse multiple countries from extraction to end use. Additionally, these materials often lack market prices due to their small quantities and China’s ability to manipulate supply and demand dynamics through non-market practices and its dominance over mid-stream processing. Critical minerals, therefore, must not be viewed as a monolithic category but as a diverse group of resources with distinct supply chain vulnerabilities. The urgency to develop comprehensive strategies for securing each of these resources cannot be overstated. Overcoming this decades-long deficit will require targeted efforts to ensure supply chain resilience, reduce dependency on foreign adversaries, and balance domestic production with strategic global partnerships. ***Figure 2. Recent Executive Orders on Critical Minerals*** https://preview.redd.it/ltsnfztg6die1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12b2fa113e580c73a62822e8898659f2685b73d3 Recognizing this strategic vulnerability, President Donald Trump’s **“Unleashing American Energy”** and **“Declaring a National Energy Emergency”** executive orders prioritize the development of domestic critical mineral supply chains. These orders elevate the priority of energy independence, reducing reliance on malign foreign states. Under “Restoring America’s Mineral Dominance,” cabinet officials have been granted such responsibilities as updating critical mineral classifications, accelerating geological mapping, maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, and assessing security implications. Meanwhile “Unleashing American Energy” prioritizes expediting domestic resource development by streamlining the permitting process and incentivizing private sector investment in domestic mining and refining capacity. These actions signal a strong commitment to reshaping the U.S. critical mineral landscape by instructing agencies to weed out impediments to building our domestic mineral base. However, targeting domestic capacity alone is insufficient for meeting surging demand with resilient supply. **Challenges to Domestic Mining** While these executive orders emphasize boosting domestic capacity, significant challenges hinder the U.S.’s ability to mine and process all its own critical minerals. More specific action items must be identified to minimize mineral dependence and its consequences. Developing a mine in the U.S. takes an average of [29 years](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf), the second-longest in the world, from first discovery to first production. This is largely due to complex permitting and environmental review processes. While mining companies expect the new administration’s emphasis on resource extraction will [expedite ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-bets-trump-will-give-green-light-us-copper-mine-ft-reports-2025-01-22/)these timetables, mining is an inherently disruptive industry. Mining projects such as Nevada’s [Thacker Pass](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/business/lithium-mining-race.html) face [opposition](https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/lets-not-blow-up-a-mountain-and-call-it-green-thacker-pass-lithium/) from local communities due to concerns about the strain on local resources, particularly the enormous [water](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/mining-water-use#overview) requirements, which can lead to shortages or contamination. Additionally, high operational costs, volatile mineral prices, and limited refining infrastructure can make domestic mining projects financially challenging. This is why strategies informed by comprehensive reviews of domestic resources are essential, along with a thorough review of the entire supply chain. To help ameliorate these inefficiencies, DevTech partner the Critical Minerals Forum (CMF) brings together private sector stakeholders and premier data firms to understand underlying structural prices and supply-demand dynamics. Since there are weak incentives for private sector entities to invest in critical mineral projects given the long lead times and complex risks, the U.S. Government must identify these vulnerabilities and collaborate with the private sector to develop comprehensive strategies and financing arrangements that ensure a secure and resilient supply of minerals. This is especially the case for minerals important to national security but currently perceived as “uneconomical” due to low prices offered by the Chinese market and commercial insignificance by miners looking to turn profits. The U.S. needs to identify “easy wins” to start diversifying its mineral supply chains domestically. As the executive orders note, many of these resources are already available within the U.S.; we simply need to take stock of material pipelines where critical minerals are currently overlooked. There are existing “[legacy](http://pathfindertonopah.com/the-project/)” brownfield (abandoned or idled sites that were previously used and still contain valuable resources) mine [sites](https://perpetuaresources.com/project/) around the U.S. and Canada that require minimal upstart. These could be moved forward through the introduction of financial capital or the expedition of regulatory processes. Additionally, expanding domestic mineral recycling—both from tailings and end-use products—can provide a valuable complementary supply source while reducing the environmental impacts of new mining operations. While developing domestic mining infrastructure—a process that takes decades—the U.S. can leverage its world-leading energy infrastructure to build its own processing capacity, which is where the competition with China is most dire. Regardless of whether large-scale domestic mining is economically viable or logistically feasible in the U.S., critical raw materials mined around the world are overwhelmingly sent to China for refinement. Even with significant mineral deposits, the U.S. lacks sufficient facilities to process and refine many raw materials into useable forms. Developing such processing and refining facilities represents a tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to solve its critical mineral problem. As China has understood for decades, the value of mining is not in the mine but in the process...[Content truncated]",Reddit

(TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) through its subsidiary Talon Nickel (USA) LLC (**""Talon""** or the **""Company""**), submitted an amended Environmental Assessment Worksheet (""**EAW**"") to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for the State's Environmental Impact Statement scoping process for the Tamarack Nickel-Copper Project, a proposed small-footprint, high-grade underground nickel mine that would be located near the City of Tamarack in Aitkin County, Minnesota (the ""**Tamarack Mining Project**""). Talon first began the review process in June 2023 ([see the Company's press release dated June 21, 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/YYg5bSknwG)). Since that time, the proposed Tamarack Mining Project has gone through two rounds of comments with the Minnesota regulatory agencies and participating tribal governments/organizations. After receiving the second round of comments on the EAW in February 2024, Talon has taken steps to investigate and propose engineered solutions to potential concerns. While this process has taken several months, the responsive engineering work underscores the Company's commitment to incorporating meaningful improvements that not only address technical requirements but also respond to broader stakeholder interests and concerns. The amended EAW covers several key conceptual aspects of the Project for scoping. **Consolidation of operations into a single enclosed building** This proposed change: * Eliminates outdoor waste rock stockpiles, significantly reducing the risk of fugitive dust outside of a controlled environment. * Simplifies stormwater management by removing the need for extensive systems to handle outdoor contact stormwater from the Tamarack Mine Project. * Reduces the developed footprint, which is now over 10 acres smaller than in the original design, reflecting the Company's focus on minimizing environmental impacts while maintaining operational goals. * Significantly diminishes nighttime light pollution preserving the natural dark-sky quality of the area. * Reduces the sound generated by future operations further limiting the project's sensory impact on the surrounding environment and community as the building serves as an effective noise barrier. **Further proposed enhancements** * Transitioning from a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) method that would require a looped tunnel, to a single decline ramp. This proposed change will decrease the volume of development rock generated and reduce material handling demands. * Shifting from manifest trains to unit trains to optimize rail transportation, reducing the frequency of shipments from the site (a single unit train equates to approximately three manifest trains). *""These proposed updates reflect Talon's ongoing commitment to listening and responding to feedback, ensuring that the Tamarack Mine Project evolves in a manner that addresses both technical requirements and the expectations of those invested in the project's success. By prioritizing environment protection, operational sustainability, and community well-being, this amended EAW underscores Talon's dedication to advancing the project responsibly,""* said Chris Wallace, Vice President of Environmental and Permitting for Talon. Jessica Johnson, Talon's Vice President, External Affairs also stated, *""Talon is excited to continue the environmental review process, where the project design will go through further evaluation. Soon the process will encourage formal public participation through providing comments on the proposed project. These comments can further shape and refine the project design.""* Information about the Environmental Review process is available on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website: [Home | Minnesota DNR (state.mn.us)](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/0Vk15TbyOx) **JESSICA JOHNSON TO LEAD EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAM** Jessica Johnson has been promoted to Vice President, External Affairs assuming all responsibilities for all external Company engagement (media, communities and government relations).

In 2001, one of the first drill holes intersected a long interval of disseminated with minor net-textured sulfides which provided some of the inspiration to drill the discovery hole in 2002 which intersected 84.2m of high-grade massive sulphide mineralization.""\* Rossell is credited with the discovery of the Eagle Deposit. *""The recent breakthrough at Boulderdash underscores the value of Talon's in-house geology, geophysics, and drilling teams in advancing exploration in Michigan,""* said Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon. He continued, *""US leaders are laser focused on US dependency on critical minerals produced by foreign entities of concern. Discovery of a potential new domestic resource of copper and nickel is very timely.""* **HISTORY OF BOULDERDASH** The Boulderdash target, part of the Ni-Cu mineralized boulder trains in the Baraga Basin, has shown encouraging results with mineralized boulders but the source of the boulders had previously been a mystery. By combining geophysical techniques with surface prospecting, Talon was able to identify a drill target and confirm the source of mineralization with the first drill hole. In 2022, Talon entered into an option and earn-in agreement with UPX Minerals Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sweetwater Royalties) to acquire up to an 80% ownership interest in the mineral rights over a land package comprised of approximately 400,000 acres located in the Upper Peninsula of the State of Michigan. The first hole drilled at Boulderdash is part of this land package. James Perry, President of Sweetwater Royalties, said of the positive drill results: *""Talon continues to demonstrate their ability to identify and advance highly prospective targets of copper-nickel mineralization. Their highly experienced in-house capability in geology, drilling and geophysics make them the ideal partner to unlock the potential of our Michigan land package. We expect there is much more to come.""* **Figure 2:** **Map Showing Regional Location of Boulderdash Project and Roland Project** https://preview.redd.it/o0qejhw5mf4e1.jpg?width=1428&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c595d31b0d124fa61a0aa983f2cda767e5bf5684 **NEXT STEPS** Talon's Boulderdash target will be followed by additional drill holes to further evaluate the mineralized system for additional mineralization and to understand the geometry of the system. The Company will also conduct borehole electromagnetic (EM) surveys to refine the understanding of the subsurface. **ROLAND TARGET UPDATE** In addition to the exciting discovery at Boulderdash, Talon continues to advance exploration efforts at the Roland Target, which was drilled earlier this year. Four (4) drill holes were completed, and an off-hole electromagnetic (EM) anomaly was identified, indicating the potential for nickel and copper mineralization. Talon plans to resume exploration at the Roland Target in the 2025 drill season to follow up on the anomaly and further evaluate the target's potential. **TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT** Talon is committed to meaningful engagement and information sharing with tribal sovereign government's proximate to its operations (see [Talon's Tribal Engagement &amp; Consultation Statement](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/YYyWLc1rnA)). Upon obtaining the mineral rights to the historic land package in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 2023, Talon executives sought meetings with the proximate tribal sovereign government in the region, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community (""**KBIC**""). Before any drilling was contemplated, Talon's executive team met with tribal leadership and the KBIC professional environmental team responsible for protecting the regional environment and band members treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather in the area outside the band's reservation boundaries. Talon has shared information with Band officials since the beginning of exploration in Michigan and sought tribal knowledge regarding the exploration program. *""Through early meetings and information sharing with KBIC officials and members, Talon has begun to better understand concerns about mineral exploration and the potential for mining in the area. We are grateful that the KBIC leadership and professional staff have shared tribal knowledge about the region's environment with us and been very clear about their concerns about the potential for mining in the region,""* said Cody Mayer, Talon's Michigan based Tribal and Community Liaison. Mayer added, *""They have also indicated that they understand the need for the energy transition and recognized that clean energy and defense systems require critical minerals like nickel and copper. We understand that the first priority for KBIC is protecting the natural environment in the region. As our mineral exploration continues, Talon is committed to keeping KBIC fully apprised of developments. Should the results ultimately point to a mineable resource, Talon is committed to seeking a consultative process with KBIC that would cover environmental concerns and also potential for economic benefit sharing.""* Talon most recently met with the KBIC Natural Resources Advisory Committee and hosted its second community meeting at the tribal casino in Baraga, MI earlier this month. **QUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALIFIED PERSON** Nickel, copper, and cobalt grades were first analyzed by a 4-acid digestion and ICP AES (ME-MS61). Grades reporting greater than 0.25% Ni and/or 0.1% Cu, using ME-MS61, trigger a sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES finish (ICP81). Platinum, palladium and gold are initially analyzed by a 50g fire assay with an ICP-MS finish (PGM-MS24). Any samples reporting &gt;1g/t Pt or Pd trigger an over-limit analysis by ICP-AES finish (PGM-ICP27) and any samples reporting &gt;1g/t Au trigger an over-limit analysis by AAS (Au-AA26). The laboratory used is ALS Minerals who is independent of the Company. Lengths are drill intersections and not necessarily true widths.

(TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") Michigan exploration drilling has produced further positive developments in its exploration at the Boulderdash target in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. **Talon's latest 3 drill holes (24BD0002, 24BD0003, and 24BD0004) have all intersected substantial intervals of copper-nickel sulphide mineralization (assays pending).** **Figure 1: Mineralized (copper-nickel) drill core from 69 meters depth in drill hole 24BD0003 (assays pending)** https://preview.redd.it/ay34ezzzlf4e1.jpg?width=617&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c8f7310484a101454e22a77702f43c4be84429c **HIGHLIGHTS** * Drill Hole 24BD0003: Encountered a **110.3-meter interval of mineralized (copper-nickel) intrusion from only 9.59 meters depth** and ranging in mineralization up to 40% sulphides; * Drill Hole 24BD0004: Intersected multiple mineralized (copper-nickel) intervals, with the most notable being a **61.91-meter interval from 13.18 to 75.09 meters,** containing sulphide concentrations between 3-25%. Additional copper-nickel intervals from 105 to 116.4 meters (11.4 meters), 142.9 to 186.08 meters (43.18 meters), and 207.4 to 280.25 meters (72.85 meters) showed sulphide content ranging from 1-15%. * Drill Hole 24BD004: Intersected copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-up clasts and copper-nickel massive sulphide veins in the core **implying that the Boulderdash intrusion has produced a copper-nickel massive sulphide body** and further drilling is required to identify the source of the massive sulphide clasts. Brian Goldner, Chief Exploration and Operations Officer, said: *""Massive sulphide rip-up clasts and veins are an important exploration tool to gain insight into the history of the intrusion. The copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-ups tell us that the system has made copper-nickel massive sulphides in the past and is at least partially remobilizing the massive sulphides while the copper-nickel massive sulphide vein can often be used as a vector for massive sulphides. Copper-nickel massive sulphide veins often form a halo radiating away from a larger copper-nickel massive sulphide body so their presence in hole 24BD0004 is very encouraging.""* Henri van Rooyen, Chief Executive Officer, says of the new drill results: *""Our in-house exploration and geophysics team is a cornerstone of Talon's strategy, allowing us to efficiently adapt our approach as new data emerges. With each drill hole, we gain valuable insights that guide our next steps, ensuring that we're making informed, data-driven decisions to maximize the potential of the Boulderdash target. This flexibility and responsiveness are essential as we advance our mission to develop copper and nickel resources domestically.""* **OBSERVATION NOTES** ***Drill Hole 24BD0002*** was drilled at a shallow plunge to understand the geometry of the host ultramafic dyke, dip direction of the hanging and footwall contact. The dyke appears to have a total width of 40 to 50 meters and steeply dipping to near vertical. In comparison, the Eagle nickel-copper deposit (also in Michigan) is hosted in a similar dyke of approximately 50 meters in width. ***Drill Hole 24BD0003*** was drilled to the west of 24BD0001 (step out of 20-30 meters). The drill hole has intersected a longer interval of copper-nickel mineralization and appears to also contain a higher concentration of copper-nickel sulphides than the discovery hole 24BD0001. ***Drill Hole 24BD0004*** is a step-out hole of 30-50 meters from drill hole 24BD0001 and intersected 61 meters of 5-25% sulphides. This hole also interested the deepest copper-nickel mineralization at Boulderdash to date with net texture mineralization observed as deep as 246 meters depth indicating that the copper-nickel mineralization may extend at depth. Additionally, drill hole 24BD0004 has shown two strong indicators of potential copper-nickel massive sulphide mineralization with copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-up clasts being observed in the intrusion and copper-nickel massive sulphide veins. **Table 1: Quick Logs from Drill Holes 24BD0002, 24BD0003, and 24BD0004** |Drill Hole (#)|From (m)|To (m)|Interval (m)|Lithology|% Sulphides| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |24BD0002|0|9.97||OB|| |9.97|36.93|26.96|UMI|5-15%|| |36.93|50.39||UMI|Tr-4%|| |50.39|93||SED|Traces|| |24BD0003|0|9.59||OB|| |9.59|119.89|110.3|UMI|Tr-40%|| |119.89|227.99||SED|Traces|| |24BD0004|0|13.18||OB|| |13.18|75.09|61.91|UMI|3-25%|| |75.09|79.24||UMI|Traces|| |79.24|105||SED||| |105|116.4|11.4|UMI|1-5%|| |116.4|142.9||SED||| |142.9|186.08|43.18|UMI|1-5%|| |186.08|207.4||SED||| |207.4|280.25|72.85|UMI|1-15%|| |280.25|289.41||SED||| |289.41|322.48||UMI|Traces|| |322.48|340.77||SED||| Quick lithology log of drill holes: Overburden (OB); Ultra-mafic intrusive (UMI); Meta-sedimentary rocks (SED). **Figure 2: Core from drill hole 24BD0004 showing copper-nickel massive sulphide veins, which can often be used to predict the existence of a more significant accumulation of massive sulphide, and shows a Massive Sulphide Unit (MSU) clast identified approximately 3cm in diameter.** https://preview.redd.it/6rg6kk60mf4e1.jpg?width=691&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d15a8edaadc39505d22b4250053f0f103fff546 **NEXT STEPS** Talon will continue its systematic drilling program at the Boulderdash target to define the extent of mineralization and gather data to further define its potential. Talon plans to move the rig off the dyke and drill three holes from the south to the north in order to identify the southern and northern contacts to better model the intrusion. Once this information is collected, Talon intends to model the geometry of the intrusion and drill a hole down the dyke since hole 24BD0004 has identified copper-nickel mineralization at depth. **Figure 3:** **Map Showing Regional Location of the Boulderdash Project** https://preview.redd.it/prxbl9d0mf4e1.jpg?width=1428&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6b7d7f39a82eab2d2b316099a9e5cc3189ec53e **QUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALIFIED PERSON** Lengths are drill intersections and not necessarily true widths.

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility. Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment. https://preview.redd.it/dxxxokowkjvd1.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=969c73e94043e155c0c3bbaf2c9b6f4ec26fd43a Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Rising demand for low-carbon technologies is escalating the need for critical minerals. These technologies require more minerals than their conventional counterparts, such as coal, oil and gas, and so the transition to renewable energy is driving substantial growth in demand for critical minerals. In fact, the energy transition could [more than double](https://www.iea.org/topics/critical-minerals) the overall demand for critical minerals by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. To establish a secure global supply of critical minerals, materials markets must balance three priorities: availability, affordability and sustainability. This can be framed as the materials trilemma: https://preview.redd.it/2sftaya2xo8d1.png?width=1698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a738b4bbec8a0fed56273f0c4139d594a5839d4 Collaborative action focused on the materials trilemma will secure a sustainable and affordable supply of critical minerals. For example, transitioning new primary assets from exploration into production typically involves long lead times due to permitting, technical issues, and other challenges. Collaboration across the value chain and public sector engagement are vital to managing and reducing these lead times. Boosting secondary (recycled) minerals supply would likewise necessitate collaborative action to increase available feedstock volumes, develop cost-effective recycling technologies, and raise [end-of-life-recycling rates](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/end-of-life-recycling-rates-for-selected-metals). # Addressing supply and demand imbalances Innovation will be essential to navigating the materials trilemma. At scale, new technologies and innovative business models can reduce market tightness by ramping up supply or reducing demand. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one example of an emerging technology that could support faster, more precise exploration and optimally efficient processing of critical minerals. Blockchain technology could enhance traceability in value chains to support supply, while new metal and battery recycling methods could maximize the recovery of high-quality materials. New approaches to lowering environmental impacts in mineral production (such as closed-loop water recycling during processing) could also help address supply and demand issues. Reducing the quantity of constrained critical minerals needed for end-use energy technologies would also be beneficial, for example, by using sodium-ion batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries. Private sector players that act now to address critical minerals supply and demand challenges in an environmentally and socially responsible manner could make vital contributions to advancing a just energy transition. While doing so, they also stand to capture the most value. For example, production process innovations that significantly reduce carbon emissions could create a [green premium](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/capturing-the-green-premium-value-from-sustainable-materials) for critical minerals because consumers will want to buy more sustainably produced materials, raising prices. # Investing in innovation However, investment is needed to develop, scale, and deploy innovations at the right pace. Both private and public sector actors have roles to play here. Mining and processing companies and end-use technology manufacturers can research, develop and implement innovative processes and technologies in their own operations. They can also invest in innovative companies and market their creations for additional amplification. For example, mining companies could boost value, efficiency, and sustainability with supply-side changes that allow them to use more low-grade ores, enhance productivity, and delay—or avoid—developing new mines. End-use technology manufacturers that reduce their reliance on critical minerals could become more resilient and better positioned to withstand potential issues within the mineral supply chain. Financial institutions also have a role to play. Investors are essential to accelerating innovation because financing is required to develop and scale novel technologies. Venture capital (VC) and private equity firms, can also leverage their networks and expertise to help innovators scale rapidly. Public sector investors with higher risk tolerance than their private sector counterparts can also make investments that could help attract additional private sector capital. This is especially relevant for early-stage innovations. Finally, governments can help create an environment that supports innovation by implementing policy and funding measures to de-risk new technology development and encourage its deployment. # Next steps Key stakeholders can accelerate innovation in critical minerals to facilitate an orderly energy transition by taking several individual and collaborative actions. # 1. Industry incumbents Industry incumbents can review innovation pipelines and optimize resource allocation to scale high-impact innovations. This could include implementing innovations in-house and marketing them as new products. These stakeholders could also build a stronger organizational culture of innovation by defining innovation as a strategic priority. This should also involve sourcing the right talent for R&amp;D efforts and adapting processes to maximize the potential of new technologies. Established organisations can identify innovative companies to invest in, including early-stage companies with novel technologies that could impact supply or demand for critical minerals. This could happen via a VC arm or through a merger or acquisition. # 2. Startups Startups could identify pain points throughout the value chain where innovation might help unlock the availability, affordability and sustainability of critical minerals. They can also determine how to access the funding needed to hyperscale innovative technology. Finally, startups could establish an organizational structure that fosters company growth, identify potential customers for a value proposition, and deploy capital effectively to produce a product. # 3. Financial institutions Investors and financiers have a role to play in terms of researching and understanding the growth potential and opportunities for investment within the critical-minerals landscape. This should cover the entire industry – from innovative cleantech startups to real mining assets. Financial institutions can also define and implement plans to support critical-minerals companies in their existing portfolios to increase their profitability, scale their products and secure widespread deployment by industry incumbents. # 4. Governments and other public sector actors Finally, the public sector could identify, evaluate and implement initiatives to de-risk investment, crowd in private sector capital, and boost deployment by industry. For example, this could be done via innovation accelerators or public-private demonstration programmes. # JUNE 26th 2024 ~Critical Minerals Summit # [U.S. Chamber of Commerce Critical Minerals Summit (uschamber.com)](https://events.uschamber.com/criticalmineralssummit/5289052) https://preview.redd.it/ufsj8adnxo8d1.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3b26ee9768f36cb1f829df89851915a0e54e598 # JUNE 24th 2024 Cheap yet ultrapure titanium metal might enable widespread use in industry [Cheap yet ultrapure titanium metal might enable widespread use in industry (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cheap-yet-ultrapure-titanium-metal-might-enable-widespread-use-in-industry/ar-BB1oncB6?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=HCTS&amp;cvid=90ba246564d84fc4a8130d173d2626eb&amp;ei=14) [Researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, have efficiently removed oxygen from high-oxygen-concentration titanium, which might help reduce the production cost of an otherwise versatile metal.

Instead, it is extracted from bauxite ore, refined into alumina, and then smelted through electrolysis. - \(Wikimedia Commons\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfhg5351kpud1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e34c9649aa677d5d1c2c7e93daffca12191482b9) # Cutting-edge innovations turn aluminum into a cornerstone of the green transition, reshaping technology and the future. Imagine a metal that's as light as it is strong, capable of taking cars further on a single charge and helping planes soar higher with less fuel. Enter aluminum – the unsung hero of the green revolution. This year, aluminum isn't just playing a supporting role in the shift to sustainability; it's stealing the spotlight, driving innovations that are making our world lighter, faster, and a whole lot greener. From electric vehicles pushing the limits of range and efficiency, to the high-capacity batteries driving them farther, and the aerospace industry's relentless pursuit of lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft, aluminum is at the core of these technological leaps. It is proving to be a game-changer, powering innovations that are shaping a sustainable future. This versatile metal has evolved far beyond recycled soda cans, now sitting at the heart of innovations driving advancements in energy storage, transportation, and beyond. Aluminum is enabling technologies crucial for a sustainable future. Its unique combination of strength, lightness, and recyclability makes aluminum indispensable in the race to cut carbon emissions and build a sustainable future. However, achieving a truly green aluminum industry comes with its own set of challenges. Traditional aluminum production is energy-intensive, with smelting processes historically responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions – a challenge central to the green paradox. Balancing the demand for this versatile metal with the need to reduce its environmental footprint is a complex dilemma that the industry is only beginning to unravel. However, recent technological advancements are beginning to shift this narrative. Innovations like carbon-free smelting, advanced batteries, cutting-edge alloys, and more are redefining aluminum's role across various industries. Aluminum's influence spans multiple industries, particularly in automotive, where its weight-reducing properties enhance both electric and internal combustion vehicles. By lightening the load, aluminum directly contributes to increased range for EVs and improved fuel efficiency for traditional vehicles. This is especially critical as automakers strive to meet stringent emissions targets while also catering to the growing demand for more efficient and longer-range vehicles. Similarly in the aerospace industry, where every pound spared can result in substantial fuel savings, aluminum is an essential material. Modern aircraft are increasingly incorporating aluminum alloys that offer a superior strength-to-weight ratio, enhancing both performance and fuel efficiency. The development of aluminum-scandium alloys, for example, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible, offering stronger, lighter components that are critical for next-generation aircraft. As the world accelerates toward a greener future, aluminum stands out as a material that's not only adaptable and resilient but also central to the technologies driving this change. Its versatility, combined with ongoing innovations in production and application, ensures that aluminum will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable future-whether it's in the air, on the road, or beyond. # Domestic shortcomings In 2024, aluminum continues to be one of the most critical materials in the global push toward sustainability. With its unique properties, this metal is integral not only to automotive and aerospace industries but also to construction, consumer goods, as well as future renewables, making it a cornerstone of modern technology and infrastructure. Feeding enough aluminum to meet the demand of these diverse industries requires a substantial supply of this increasingly critical metal. In 2023, the apparent domestic consumption of aluminum in the U.S. was around 4 million metric tons. However, this figure doesn't fully capture the total aluminum brought into the country. According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.8 million metric tons of crude and semi-manufactured aluminum. With the country being 44% reliant on these imports, this data suggests that actual consumption may be higher than reported, or that a portion of the imported aluminum is being stockpiled, exported, or otherwise allocated for future use. Regardless of the actual number, the U.S. currently operates only five primary aluminum smelters, and from those, produced around 19% of the apparent consumption last year, approximately 750,000 metric tons. Although not as reliant as some of the other critical minerals, this limited domestic production highlights another possible vulnerability in the supply chain. As global demand for aluminum continues to grow, this dependence poses risks not only to national security but also to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions. # Green paradox In the world of materials science and industrial production, a complex issue known as the ""green paradox"" has long been recognized. The green paradox refers to the irony that materials essential for advancing green technologies often come with significant environmental and social costs in their production – negating at least some of their potential benefits. This concept is a recurring theme not just for aluminum, but for numerous critical materials like lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, copper, and nickel. Things like EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, advanced batteries, and even the electrical grids that support renewable energy infrastructure all rely heavily on these critical minerals. Without them, the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future simply wouldn't be possible. Despite the undeniable benefits they offer, the extraction and processing of these materials often comes at a steep environmental cost. Aluminum and copper mining are energy-intensive and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, while lithium and cobalt extraction can lead to water depletion and are strongly tinged with ethical concerns. Hence, a paradox: they are essential for a greener future, yet their production methods are often anything but green. # The fire With a mix of cutting-edge technology and bold ambition, global mining company Rio Tinto is rewriting the rules of aluminum production, turning what was once an environmental risk into an opportunity for innovation by attacking aluminum production from two fronts – by revolutionizing the smelting process itself and the fuel that powers it. Joining forces with industry leader Alcoa, Rio Tinto is addressing the challenge of carbon emissions from aluminum smelting using an innovative new technology. Described as the most significant advancement in the aluminum industry in over a century, this technology, known as ELYSIS, replaces the traditional carbon anodes in the electrolytic cells of electric furnaces with proprietary inert anodes. Instead of producing CO2 as a byproduct, these inert anodes release pure oxygen. This climate-saving technology is expected to lower production costs by 15% and increase output by the same percentage.

Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/dy6znxxmmjqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272966927f85f6a392fb1226e7b0a3b5bab6ea7a) # Reliance on imports for this white metal could darken days. When people see something pristine white, they often think of it as pure or clean – this imagery is plastered everywhere, from unblemished lab coats to sterilized hospitals. Yet, it may be surprising to know that the rich whiteness seen in many consumer products actually comes from a critical metal, titanium. From the whiteness of milk to the foundation used in makeup, if it is used to lighten or brighten, it most likely contains titanium. According to the United States Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, a significant portion – an estimated 90% -- of the titanium mined each year is used to impart a stark whiteness to a wide variety of consumer goods we use every day. ""Titanium is different than most other metallic elements in that it is mined primarily to satisfy demands for a chemical product – titanium dioxide for pigment – rather than for the metal itself,"" the U.S. Geological Survey penned in a 2018 report on the luminous metal. Despite its widespread use in consumer products, the importance of titanium extends far beyond just its whitening properties. This metal also plays a crucial role in various high-tech and strategic applications that stress its classification as a critical mineral. # Titanium's critical role Titanium's unique properties, such as a high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high-temperature stability, make it indispensable in multiple high-tech and strategic applications. # Titanium's critical role Titanium's unique properties, such as a high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high-temperature stability, make it indispensable in multiple high-tech and strategic applications. The aerospace industry heavily relies on titanium for aircraft structures and engines. The metal's intrinsic functions enable the production of aircraft that are both lightweight and strong, significantly improving fuel efficiency and overall performance. In the defense sector, titanium is crucial for manufacturing similarly lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant components for military aircraft, naval vessels, missiles, and armor plating. This durable metal enhances the performance and longevity of basically all military equipment, making it a strategic material for national security. Furthermore, titanium is vital in the energy sector, particularly in power generation, where its resistance to corrosion and ability to withstand high temperatures are essential for constructing power plants, offshore oil rigs, and pipelines. The durable metal's biocompatibility also makes it a preferred material for medical implants, such as joint replacements and dental fixtures. To appreciate titanium's critical role, it is essential to understand its journey from raw mineral to the versatile material used across various industries. # Not just a metal While most immediately think of solid titanium in high-performance sports equipment or large armor plating, it is actually its powdered form, known as sponge titanium, that comprises the basis of the entire titanium industry. Sponge titanium, used to produce titanium ingots, is transformed into slab, billet, pipe, bar, plate, sheet, and other mill products. This highly volatile form of pure titanium is also used to create the beautiful flashes of white light in fireworks. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is what delivers exceptional whiteness to a wide variety of household goods and foods. It has three qualities that make it ideal for creating whiter whites – it is white, safe for human consumption, and scatters light extremely well. ""Titanium dioxide has properties for whiteness, opacity, and chemical inertness that make it especially suitable for use as a pigment to impart a durable white color to paints, paper, plastic, sunscreen, toothpaste, and wallboard,"" the USGS wrote in its 2018 titanium report. Most high-quality white paints available today contain ""titanium white,"" a pigment made from titanium dioxide. In addition to imparting a reflectiveness and whiteness that makes rooms appear brighter, titanium dioxide increases paint's opacity, assisting in the ""one-coat cover"" touted by many manufacturers. It is also used to make foods such as skim milk and cottage cheese whiter and creamier looking, and even to enhance the whiteness of paper. There are very few replacements for titanium dioxide when it comes to pigments. Lead, once the ingredient of choice for white paint for nearly 2,000 years, has similar whitening qualities but is seldom used today because of its toxicity. According to the USGS, more than 95% of titanium mineral concentrates in 2023 were consumed by domestic pigment producers. Because it is used in such a wide variety of products, most U.S. consumers use a product containing titanium dioxide every day. However, the production and supply of titanium face significant challenges, impacting its availability and cost. Even with the high demand for titanium dioxide in consumer products and its importance in strategic applications, domestic titanium production in the United States has faced a downturn. # Current landscape # ***According to USGS, titanium sponge metal was produced by only one operation in the U.S. last year. [A puck of titanium sponge, the porous form of titanium created during the initial processing of the ilmenite or rutile, crucial for producing high-performance aerospace components and consumer goods. Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/ufzzvpoymjqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39d2d7d76c57262f19da469222cf4d9cb958ded) This facility, operated by ATI Titanium LLC (a subsidiary of Allegheny Technologies Inc.) in Salt Lake City, Utah, has an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year and produces titanium that is further refined for use in electronics. To give perspective, 500 tons of titanium sponge is roughly enough to manufacture the components for around 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which each use approximately 10 tons of titanium. However, the U.S. requires much more titanium annually, with estimated consumption around 40,000 tons, primarily for aerospace, defense, and industrial applications. In 2023 alone, the U.S. imported approximately 42,000 tons of titanium sponge to meet this demand, highlighting the significant reliance on foreign sources despite the high domestic need. At one point, two other facilities held a combined capacity of roughly 23,500 tons, enough to support more than half of the country's needs, but these facilities have since been in an idled status since 2016 and 2020, respectively. The idling of these facilities, operated by TIMET (Titanium Metals Corporation) in Henderson, Nevada, and another in Rowley, Utah, by ATI Titanium, reflects the broader challenges faced by the domestic titanium industry, including fluctuating market conditions, high operational costs, and competition from foreign producers. Recognizing the strategic importance of titanium, the U.S. government has taken steps to support the domestic industry. The Department of Defense, for example, has invested in several projects to ensure a reliable supply of titanium for military applications. In recent years, the Defense Production Act Title III has been invoked to bolster domestic production of critical minerals, including titanium. This act provides funding for the development of new extraction and processing technologies and offers incentives for companies to expand their production capabilities. Additionally, the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) program has been leveraged to maintain reserves of titanium sponge and other critical materials to mitigate supply chain disruptions. While these initiatives are vital for addressing immediate supply chain vulnerabilities, long-term sustainability of the titanium supply also hinges on expanding domestic mining and production capabilities. Efforts are underway to develop new titanium mines and production facilities across North America, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign sources and enhance the resilience of the supply chain. # North America has titanium From the western reaches of Alaska to the far east of Quebec in Canada, numerous locations of possible iron-rich deposits have been recorded, and where there is iron, there is a good chance there is the titanium mineral ilmenite. Additionally, the continental U.S., including regions in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, hosts significant potential titanium stores, with heavy mineral sand deposits rich in titanium. [Rutile, a titanium-rich mineral, is essential for producing titanium dioxide, widely used in paints, plastics, and paper.

Mining operations generally use surface techniques like open-pit mining and dredging to excavate these minerals, which are then processed through gravity and magnetic separation methods to isolate the titanium minerals from other materials.

858,Global,2024-10,"wall street breakfast-Tesla's most awaited 'We, Robot' event - Elon Musk called it ""one for the history books"" - is finally happening this week. With expectations running high for Tesla’s robotaxi reveal, what is your prediction for TSLA shares after the event? · Huge gain (watershed moment for TSLA) · Slight rise/dip (expectations already priced in) · Big decline (prepare to be disappointed) Take the survey here and don't forget to share your thoughts in the WSB comments section. Energy reshift BP (BP) is scaling back its energy transition strategy and will drop its ambitious target of cutting oil and gas production by 2030, with plans to raise its output instead, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. This would mark a major shift for the oil giant at a time when its plan to boost renewables has raised concerns over profitability. Strategy pivot: Back in 2020, BP pledged to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, widely seen as the sector's most ambitious target. This was scaled back last year to a 25% cut. But now, BP is looking to increase its oil and gas production, eyeing investments in three new projects in Iraq and in re-developing oilfields in Kuwait. It is moving ahead with the development of oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and is also weighing acquiring assets in the Permian Basin. Prioritizing profits: BP has paused investment in new offshore wind and biofuel projects in recent months, and reduced the number of low-carbon hydrogen projects to 10 from 30. The move comes as clean energy projects are facing supply chain issues and rising costs amid higher interest rates. Recall that BP is targeting $2B cost savings by 2026-end. While the updated strategy is expected to be unveiled in February, the company has already dropped the 2030 production cut target in practice. Not alone: Rival Shell (SHEL) has also scaled back its energy transition strategy this year, scrapping several renewable energy projects and exiting power businesses to refocus efforts on oil and gas. In other news, the British energy giant on Monday raised its production guidance for LNG as well as upstream oil and gas. (10 comments) What else is happening...

859,Global,2024-09,"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)-In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility. Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/gpxy8dtv7lod1.jpg?width=1401&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=369dea678cb414a6be4002b7c9ac0be994d234b8 Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge. Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/hct7dqsw7lod1.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3b1df82160d0b893346ce89ba14f61ce4fc46b9 The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves. In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/lawzlddx7lod1.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a3f0635d608953d455583d517e72117cba49867 Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value. The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/flb6x17y7lod1.jpg?width=1132&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122d4b6ae1bf4624c81c66e7a23c2b59f6b2a9db https://preview.redd.it/4iwvpy6y7lod1.jpg?width=516&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e30a8465abb188b3fc59232f23ee2a4b481b91 **James C.

Adding the second boat is a break from the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget, which called for a single Virginia-class submarine and a boost to the submarine industrial base to meet the goal of delivering two attack submarines per year and meet the delivery schedule for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine. “I’m glad that the committee came together this year to pass a bill that makes critical investments to support our defense industrial base workforce and shipbuilding programs, including the Virginia-class submarine program to help ensure we meet our commitments through the Australia-U.K.-U.S. agreement,” reads a statement from SASC sea power chair Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). The two-boat buy is a break from the House Appropriations Committee’s bill that only called for a single boat. The HAC defense subcommittee’s chair, Rep Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), told *Bloomberg* earlier this month he didn’t believe that submarine builders General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII could meet the two-per-year cadence. “I’m in favor of building three submarines a year,” Calvert said. “It’s our strategic advantage to do so. The problem is the industrial base, the primes, the subs, are not capable of building more than one submarine a year. That is just a fact. It’s just a fact we have to deal with. I wish it wasn’t so.” In addition to HAC-D, the White House earlier this week also pushed back against a second sub buy [in a memo to the HASC](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/12/white-house-memo-on-hasc-fy-2025-defense-bill). “Further, the Administration strongly opposes … incremental funding of a second Virginia Class Submarine in FY 2025, which industry is unable to produce on schedule,” the White House wrote in a memo responding to the HASC bill. The split on the Virginias between the authorizers, appropriators and the administration is set to be one of the largest issues to sort out in the shipbuilding budget. In addition to the extra boat, the SASC authorized an additional $1.43 billion to build a third Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyer. The legislation also expresses concern over the ship design maturity, restricting to funds pending reports from the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Specifically, the SASC singled out the Landing Ship Medium and the Constellation-class guided-missile frigate. “\[The bill\] prohibits lead ship construction for the Landing Ship Medium pending certification of design completion and authorizes the procurement or chartering of a minimally-modified commercial or non-developmental landing ship that meets core Marine Corps sealift and beach landing requirements,” reads the executive summary of the bill. “\[The bill\] fences Fiscal Year 2025 funds for Constellation-class frigate construction pending DoD certification relating to design completion.” Earlier this year, the Navy announced that the lead ship in the Constellation-class was an estimated three years behind schedule and that the detail design is still incomplete. Overall, the bill adds an additional $25 billion to the Pentagon budget request for a total of $878.4 billion. The bill left committee with a 22-3 vote that included a “nay” from SASC chair Sen. Jack Reed (D- R.I.) for breaking spending caps set in place by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The proposed SASC National Defense Authorization Act comes in parallel with a new overall spending plan by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) that calls for a $55 billion boost in defense funding for FY 2025 and an overall increase to about five percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. In a Friday statement, Senate majority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the proposed increase in defense spending would either mean repealing FRA or crafting a new budget deal. “In that case, Democrats are committed to ensuring an equitable increase in our domestic investments alongside an increase in defense spending,” reads the statement. # JUNE 2024 ~Fiscal Year 2025 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT~ Executive Summary: [fy25\_ndaa\_executive\_summary.pdf (senate.gov)](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy25_ndaa_executive_summary.pdf) https://preview.redd.it/5nxxoedq857d1.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a979899686d506d07ace2676c5817fe3a222bd8 # Building American Combat Power • Authorizes a national defense topline increase of $25 billion, including increased procurement of combat vessels, aircraft, and vehicles. • Authorizes an additional $1.43 billion for a third DDG Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. • Authorizes increased funding to enhance the submarine industrial base and to support the construction of a second Virginia-class submarine in FY 2025. • Directs a briefing on the feasibility of land-basing the contents of Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS-3) in a partner nation. • Authorizes increased funding for military construction projects. • Establishes a cross-functional team to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Reform. • Requires an assessment of the recommendations on the final report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States. • Requires a DOD plan for deterring and defeating simultaneous aggression by two near-peer nuclear competitors, including requirements for nuclear force sizing. • Requires the development of a national integrated air and missile defense architecture. # Emerging Weapons and Technologies • Directs a briefing on current and future capabilities to test directed energy systems.

(TSXV:ARK)(OTCQB:ARRKF) (""Arras"" or ""the Company"")** is pleased to provide an update on its exploration activities underway across the project portfolio in NE Kazakhstan. **Highlights** * 3,547 line-kilometer Heli-TEM survey over the entire 1397 square-kilometer Bozshakol project mineral tenement package announced July 22, 2024 has now been completed * KGK Drill program underway at Aktasty and Maisor licenses (Bozshakol project) targeting high-priority areas to test bedrock under 10-40 m of unconsolidated cover * Ground IP Survey at Elemes project is now 80% completed, high priority targets identified, core drill program now underway at Berezski East and Berezski Central targets * KGK Drill program at Tay project completed https://preview.redd.it/t2mhsnscxqqd1.jpg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457b8de779907bdd12b8c1d8a7a11d46486ccaf7 **Bozshakol Project:** The Bozshakol Project (Package ""A"" in Figure 1) is located 56km to the northwest of the town of Ekibastuz and surrounds and covers the potential continuation of mineralization of KAZ Minerals' Bozshakol copper- mine. The Heli-Tem survey announced on July 22 nd has now been completed. Analysis of data is underway. A 17,000-meter KGK drill program has commenced at the Aktasty and Maisor licenses to test the bedrock at targets identified through geophysics and soil sampling completed to date, and to better understand the subsurface geology that lays below 10-40 m of quaternary cover. This program, along with the Heli-Tem survey is expected to inform on priority drill targets for 2025. **Elemes Project:** The Ground IP Survey at the Elemes project which commenced in July is approximately 80% complete and expected to be finished in September. The survey over the Berezski East and Berezski Central target areas has been completed and drill targets for these areas prioritized. A core drill is now underway at these areas with drilling at the Elemes Project expected to continue across a number of priority targets into November with 5000m planned for this Phase I program. Initial assays are expected in November. https://preview.redd.it/pnz4ghtcxqqd1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883d2c68c753069f9b7e107ab0d0164f01c07370 **Tay Project:** A 5,424m KGK drilling program has been completed at the Tay Project. This program targeted the Soviet-era IP anomaly that formed the basis to acquire the license earlier this year. The 135 KGK holes successfully tested the top of bedrock across the anomaly returning predominantly basalts and schists. Following completion of the KGK program, a single line of Ground IP survey was undertaken which confirmed the location of the Soviet IP anomaly with inversion analysis indicating an anomaly at approximately 140m below surface. Given the KGK drill is not able to reach that depth, a single core hole was drilled to test the heart of the anomaly and was drilled to 400 m. Visual results from the hole indicate several zones of chalcopyrite mineralization along fractures within basalts and gabbros. Priority intervals have been dispatched to the assay lab with results expected in October. **Tim Barry, CEO commented,** ""We are very pleased with how the programs are progressing so far this summer with activity across virtually the entire license package. The Ground IP survey at Elemes has progressed well and we are excited to have a drill turning there now as we begin to test the first batch of new priority targets at this exciting project. Additionally, all the work taking place at the Bozshakol group is advancing this project area to prioritize drill targets and follow-up areas ahead of an expected busy drilling campaign in 2025. At Tay, while we are awaiting assay results, we were surprised to not see more intensive alteration and sulfides in the drill core given how well the IP anomaly was confirmed with our own Ground IP survey. Once assays are received, we will review and decide on next steps at Tay."" **Qualified Person:** The scientific and technical disclosure for this news release has been prepared under supervision of and approved by Matthew Booth, Vice President of Exploration, of Arras Minerals Corp., a Qualified Person for the purposes of NI 43-101.

862,Global,2024-09,"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)-In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility. Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/pt4n96xq7lod1.jpg?width=1401&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d1b202dc9b2071cee8f24c05ef593af7817b9bf Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge. Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/yd8y5zlr7lod1.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d29b8a3225318b88f889b091308fb7836bc4dea5 The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves. In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/30r1zv9s7lod1.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ac7e97d36620e510ad846f5e8cee00d8c506fac Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value. The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales. &amp;#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/s9lb0q7t7lod1.jpg?width=1132&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ed5d2ab2d757f2197d1bbda23badc902592f728 https://preview.redd.it/xi2dhr7t7lod1.jpg?width=516&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2da7538e13560899d97b86de877080f0bd07d3cf **James C.
