I'm all for hiring more women in male dominated work places, but only if the policy is to get more women to apply thus making it far more likely a woman will be the best applicant. 

If the policy is simply hire more women then if ten people were interviewed for a job,  9 men and one woman,  you already know who's getting the job. You also know there's a good chance she wasn't the best applicant and she will be treated as a diversity hire on site. Unfortunately so will most women,  even though many will be employed because they were the best applicant.  The bulk of the men will just assume a woman is there because of her extra x chromosome and nothing more. 

Targets lower morale and devalue the people you proport to value.

By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone and their wives' boyfriends saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining U stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operation Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If They were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale. At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 2, 3 4+ Billion USD per year for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company current has 200 million in liquid cash right now, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen (NXE) deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO), specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

My positions:

1300 shares at 5.37 a share  
5 January 25 5C calls  
5 November 25 6C calls  
12 January 25 6C calls  
10 December 7C calls  
100 November 7C calls (regard gambit for pennies)  

If you missed the start of space stock frenzy a few months back, here’s your next chance. Don’t bitch to me later if you miss the boat.

No wonder these companies pay so much little tax compared with similar projects in Qatar (on average 20x higher taxable income from these projects) as well as in Norway (the government there has significant ownership in each mining operation. We have close to none).

But the government recently made a U-turn on the issue following a court decision last month that said the order to revoke the permits awarded to Rio Tinto was “not in line with the constitution and the law”.

Retko dolazim, ali kad i dođem, uvek odem do Gubera (nekadašnjeg lokaliteta banje Guber). To je pravo čudo prirode: zemljište je obogaćeno kojekakvim rudama (izvinite, ne znam pravi izraz za to), vode koje protiču kroz samu banju su lekovite zbog tih ruda, sama korita/izvorišta su crvene boje, vazduh je neverovatno kvalitetan, itd itd.

E pa, danas sam otišla do gore, i čuvena očna voda jedva kaplje. Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto.

Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište.

Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga?

Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi. Rimljani su isto tu napravili prokop (da bi prenosili rude do Sasa, to prokopište se i dalje nalazi tu i vidi lepo).

This post will surely get a lot of hate, but i see a lot of uninformed people spreading FUD either cause they lost money or want to troll. Hopefully this helps anyone that’s serious about their investment and needs some reassurance. The main thing that’s caused some confusion is the fact that most people only read or know about the 6-K and not the 20-F. The 6-K is only a summary of the 20-F that’s published in a PR format for easier reading. Depending on the company, you can find future guidance and some of the juicier things in the 6-K, but that wasn’t the case for us.

My aim with this post is to provide information on some of the things we’ve found in the 20-F that might be unknown to some of you.

#Israel Railways

https://preview.redd.it/ckkaybqp18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a5433734f83f77b64486a1ca734513c90c0cb4d

This excerpt highlights the current stage of their deal with Israeli Railways and what we can expect to come from them in the future. A lot people assumed that they were already paid for the 10 Main Line systems from January 31st 2023, but from our understanding based on this screenshot, seems like they’re still owed the majority of this amount once they finish installing the last of the systems. We suspect it took them this long because they needed to be certified first before installing their tech on passenger units, there isn’t much information on that currently. 


https://preview.redd.it/fjbjikfh18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b9d92ee654dfb023b4f432592844da0de5d980e

As you can see this one is a bit different and goes into detail of just how huge this deal could be for Rail Vision in the near future. They have a long history working together and this is Rail Vision’s turf so i wouldn’t be surprised if this is where they get their first “big” contract. Installing their tech on 300 trains and possibly doubling that to 600 units for bidirectional functionality is a massive opportunity. At this stage, their tech would be recognized as successful and profitable for the business and would also help attract further interest from outside parties.



#Rio Tinto Iron Core

https://preview.redd.it/6yffowta18se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ed7b31d07138242a535c6677912b4e65a0a480

This is a big one, a lot of us rightfully assumed that Rio Tinto was dead in the water so this is new to us and very important. From what we can read here, this deal is very similar to the one from India. Rail Vision signed a supply agreement with Hitachi Rail STS to provide Rio Tinto with detection systems for testing. The pilot ended in August 2022 and since then we haven’t heard anything from them. The thing is that they stopped testing altogether, they haven’t done pilots with any other company since then. It seems that they’ve been reviewing the data gathered by us and they’ve been planning the next phase to possibly procure our tech. This is evident now that they’re releasing tenders in Q2 2025 and Rail Vision is participating. Nothing is publicly confirmed as of yet, but this could be an unexpected catalyst before EOY.




#Existing Pilots

https://preview.redd.it/pnygldc818se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76e1af49c244af41f9f2e0bd98859cad235cc60d

From this paragraph right here we get a bit more information on how it is that they roll out their units for pilot testing. So first it mentions how they have multiple pilots running at the same time, these are the ones from North America, Central America, India and presumably South America with Vale. Most of these pilots started around the same time in 2024 and based on current data, we can expect these to finish by mid 2025. 



#Financials - Balance Sheet and Runway

As of Dec 2024, Rail Vision had $17.5M in cash, up from $3.3M the year prior. This comes from $24.1M in gross raised through private placements, warrant exercises, and the equity line.

With operating cash burn at $9.7M for 2024, they currently have about 1.5 to 2 years of runway if spending remains the same, more if pilot contracts convert and revenue goes up. That gives them time to push pilots into rollouts without needing to dilute.




#Research and Development (RnD)

https://preview.redd.it/rfwlwmzy08se1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3d0bdb1e50f461ca93e9ae3f45c94af45f3c861

Rail Vision’s RnD expenses for the year 2024 were $5.28 million, down from $7.15 million in 2023. This shows a 26% decrease YoY.

From this paragraph we can see they reduced their RnD team by 12 employees and spent less on equipment and materials. This is a positive sign as they’re phasing out of the heavy RnD phase, we should expect this trend to continue for future reports. 

Additionally there are some things i found regarding what they’re currently working on when it comes to RnD. These include: Maintenance and Predictive Maintenance, Data Services and Mapping. 




#Operating Loss

https://preview.redd.it/gu1vpv4218se1.jpg?width=1256&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fbdf2cc8a217656ba9bfc59702ed17435be57a

Rail Vision reported an operating loss of $9 million which is an improvement from the $11.4 million in 2023. This is a 21% reduction YoY.

The two main reasons for this reduction are the reduced expenses from RnD which are down $1.87 million and also the higher revenue generated of $1.3 million. Again, we can expect these figures to get better and better in future reports. 

They’re improving on operational efficiency and they’re proving that they know what they’re doing when it comes to the management of their finances. If the prior pilots convert to full contracts in 2025 then we can expect profitability by H2 2025.  



#Opportunity Roadmap

https://preview.redd.it/74ivfo3k28se1.jpg?width=1312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57300b1f6ccef324b2026d92aec25bbd92bd2d2f

Also wanted to share a roadmap from u/Time_Shoulder_1493, i think its a good visual to show all of the active pilots and everything else Rail Vision is working on.



#Closing Remarks

In my own personal opinion, this ER is exactly what we expected. There isn’t any surprises when it comes to their financials, they’re reducing expenses by cutting their biggest spender which is RnD and growing their revenue through multiple clients. I believe this will only get better with time as they finish the current pilots and start gaining contracts. If these contracts come to fruition then i expect profitability by H2 2025.

I know this is a very difficult time we’re going through and  the lack of transparency from management only makes it worse. I believe that the general feeling we’re all experiencing could’ve been avoided if only they communicated with us. The good thing is that they’re working, they have presence in multiple countries and there’s potential contracts in the near future. They seem optimistic about what could possibly happen this year and they’re probably getting promising feedback from their pilots. For now i’ll remain patient and look forward to H1 2025.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:17.847177,2025-04-02T00:06:33,Rio Tinto,2025

[ \(photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex-Palantir designer u\/gottacroe and my wife u\/LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein\)](https://preview.redd.it/alrclog6jph61.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccc3ebfc134179b868459db097dd9d1e51534c1)

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

&gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

&gt;*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&amp;#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Just seeking any feedback from those who have done the onboarding process with Rio Tinto.

Had the call about a month ago congratulating me on being selected for the role.

Have not heard anything since. Would have expected maybe a generic email from HR but nothing. I was advised that it can be a slow process and not to quit my current job, which is fine. 

Just curious if anyone else has experience in the process and can shed some light on a timeframe/next steps.

This is for a site-based role if it makes a difference. Not a graduate or white collar role.

Thanks",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:17.847527,2025-09-03T22:16:54,Rio Tinto,2025

Isto devido a reputação ganha nos anos 2000. Porem qual a razão por continuar a ser tao espalhada essa imagem decadas depois.?

Eu irei me mudar daqui a umas semanas para a avenida da conduta entre fanzeres e rio tinto. Eu nunca tinha ido para essas zonas, mas ja desde o meu tempo de estudante ouvia as novelas contadas sobre essa zona. Tanto amigos como colegas de trabalho e ate os homens que estao a fazer ad remodelações nao param de dizer, “vais te arrepender, rio tinto nao da para andar a pe sem ser assaltado a noite é de esquecer, carro senao tiver na garagem nem um dia ta sem os vidros partidos, as pessoas sao todas de mau feitio e nao ajudam ninguém, quando for jogo do porto fodem tudo nas ruas, anda sempre de faca no bolso, devias ter ido para gaia ou para a maia onde nao existem gunas é so gente idosa aka os dormitorios do porto etc”.

Porem do que explorei da zona ate agora parece me pacifica e os vizinhos ate agora foram 5* e mesmo funcionários de lojas a que fui e restaurantes, nada de diferente de outras periferias do porto, ve se um guna por entre outro, sim mas isso em nada difere do resto do porto, o guna por m2 em zonas como paranhos, matosinhos perto do norte e boavista na cm é bem maior e ninguem fala mal dessas zona. 

Claro nao digo que isto seja uma foz do douro ou jardins da arrabida mas nao me parece de todo a imagem que as pessoas fazem passar que isto seja quase o bairro do cerco. Porque é que as pessoas continuam a transmitir esta imagem de fanzeres/rio tinto? Eu tou me a foder para o que as outras pessoas acham mas admito que me mete uns nervos quando alguém pergunta onde comprei casa e eu digo rio tinto e malta ou comenta ou faz uma cara a questionar se porque ali.

E acho comico a ideia que se criou que em gaia não a crime ou gunas (nao posso falar da maia mas vivi bastante tempo do outro lado do rio para so me rir de ouvir isso)",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:17.847570,2025-02-17T05:56:50,Rio Tinto,2025

Veceras na RTS je bila korisna naucna rasprava u vezi iskopavanja litijuma, dva clana debate su za, a dva protiv rudarenja Jadarita, rekao bih da ovaj jedan (Dejan Ilic) i nije naucnik, ali vredi pogledati.

Za one koji nemaju volje i vremena za to, ukratko cu izneti bitne zakljucke.

Studije i analize koje je iznela kompanija Rio Tinto su Teorijski izvodljive. kada bi stvari gledali teoretski.

Svaki rudnik ima odrdjen uticaj na zivotnu sredinu, samo je pitanje koliko. S obzirom da je Jadar veliki Rudnik,ne kao Bor, ali odredjena kontaminacija bi sigurno postojala. Zbog toga se svi rudnici Litijuma u svetu nalaze u industrijskim zonama i u nenaseljenim mestima, kako bi sve bilo pogodno za eksploataciju.

Dubina na kojoj se nalazi ruda je na 350m do 700m ispod povrsine zemlje, sto je dobro sa ekoloskog aspekta jer se ne radi o povrsinskom kopu.

Litijum se u svetu masovno proizovdi iz minerala spodumena i taj mineral ima istu kolicinu litijuma kao jadarit, s tim sto jadarit ima i natrijum i bor i silicijum, a spodumen se sastoji od litijuma, silicijuma i aluminijuma pa kada se izdvoji Litijum ostaje alumosilikat koji nije opasan po zivotnu sredinu. Tako da bi se morao resavati i problem bora i natrijuma.

Jadarit je i otkriven tako sto se trazio bor, ali trenutno potraznja za borom i bornim jedinjenjima kao prozivodima trenutno nema komercijalnu vrednost, a to potvrdjuje i podatak da Rio Tinto u rudnicima u Kaliforniji poseduje rezerve Bora koji je ostao u otpadu.

Na sadasnjem nivou razvoja tehnologije jos nije izveden proces razdvajanja litijuma od bora bez velike kolicine bora kao otpada i to bi bio novi tehnoloski proces koja se planira u Jadru. 

Kolicina Sumporne kiseline da bi se razlozio Jadarit je 943tona dnevno, koje bi se dovozile u Jadar narednih 10000dana, koliko iznosi period eksploatacije litijuma u Jadru.

Jedne od najvecih rezervi pijacih podzemnih voda se nalaze u Macvi, na 15km od rudnika, postoje brojni rizici kontaminacije tih voda, mogucnost poplava,stvaranja pukotina u vodonepropusnim stenama usled sleganja tla. Rio Tinto je u svojoj studiji naveo da ce ceo rudnik biti podignut iznad nivoa poplavnog talasa iz 2014. godine tako sto ce podici ceo plato rudnika za 4m na POVRSINI OD 220 HEKTARA. Kako?

Odluka ce na kraju biti politicka.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:17.847662,2024-09-18T08:44:38,Rio Tinto,2024

155,1g5c5pb,"Energy Fuels ($UUUU), the next Rio Tinto",Rippedyanu1,/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1g5c5pb/energy_fuels_uuuu_the_next_rio_tinto/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/1g5c5pb/energy_fuels_uuuu_the_next_rio_tinto/,75,34,1729118325.0,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 60+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 100 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

As I’m sure everyone saw today, Energy Fuels (ticker UUUU) ran up 15% today and was the leading mining stock of the entire mining sector for today. I’m here to tell you that this run up is just the start and that UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value \~$83/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the 90s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take \~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale.

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company currently has 200 million in liquid cash, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be \~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen's (NXE) Arrow deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO) or close to it, specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto which trades at a 110Billion market cap. If UUUU even becomes worth 20% of that which I think is a fair assessment given the above points (I didn't even get into vanadium mineralization) that would be \~120 a share based on the current float. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 60/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 100+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

(Bloomberg) -- The US-China dispute over Beijing’s control of rare earth supplies has yet to be resolved, the head of a visiting US congressional delegation said after meeting Chinese officials, signaling a key irritant persists in bilateral relations.

Representative Adam Smith described continuing challenges on the matter in a press briefing on Tuesday in the Chinese capital, where he’s leading the [first](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-21/china-hosts-us-house-group-as-tiktok-trade-talks-gain-momentum) official visit by US House lawmakers since 2019 as relations steady before a [potential meeting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-19/xi-asks-trump-to-avoid-taking-restrictive-trade-measures-in-call) between the countries’ presidents.

**“I don’t think we resolved the rare earth question,” Smith said, without specifying what the sticking points are. “I think that that still needs to be worked on.”**

China dominates the global supply and processing of the minerals, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to advanced weaponry. Beijing has used its position as a [strategic lever](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/china-deploys-rare-earths-as-weapon-in-trade-war-with-trump) as trade tensions with the Trump administration escalated earlier this year.

The two governments reached a framework agreement in June that includes a [Chinese commitment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-27/china-says-it-confirms-trade-framework-details-with-us) to review applications for shipping rare earth magnets, although few details of the deal have been disclosed. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer last week said supplies to his country had “bounced back up significantly,” although European companies have complained about [shortages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/china-rare-earth-product-exports-hit-highest-since-at-least-2012) that threaten to halt production.

Smith also struck a note of caution in response to a reporter’s question about whether Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. will have any role in maintaining the app’s algorithm in the US. Citing privacy and security concerns, he said the matter has “not been 100% resolved,” while adding that he wasn’t privy to the negotiations. 

The US and China are nearing an agreement to hive off the US operations of social media platform TikTok to a consortium that includes software giant Oracle Corp. Under the spin-off arrangement being discussed, TikTok will be majority-owned and controlled by Americans, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Many of the finer details of the agreement have yet to be made public.

Joined by US Ambassador to China David Perdue, the delegation’s visit may build more goodwill ahead of a possible sitdown between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month in South Korea. 

The world’s two largest economies are in the [final stages](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/us-china-talks-for-huge-boeing-aircraft-order-in-final-stages) of negotiations for a “huge” Boeing Co. aircraft order, Perdue said at the briefing. Such a deal, which has been years in the making, would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two nations but has been contingent on an easing in tensions.

On the security front, Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, urged Beijing to engage in talks over its “rapidly growing nuclear arsenal” to prevent miscalculation. 

“When you’re getting up into the hundreds, close to 1,000 on nuclear weapons, it’s time to start having a conversation about it to make sure that we understand each other,” Smith said. He stressed the need for better military-to-military dialogue, a message he delivered in meetings with Chinese officials including Premier Li Qiang since the delegation arrived on Sunday. 

During the trip, the US delegation has also discussed the flow of fentanyl and called for fair [access](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/us-lawmakers-call-for-more-defense-talks-in-rare-china-visit) to China’s market for US firms.

The group is scheduled to meet with National People’s Congress Chairman Zhao Leji and Foreign Minister Wang Yi later on Tuesday, Vice Premier He Lifeng said Monday.

# SEPT. 23, 2025~Australian critical minerals firms flock to US opportunities

[Australian critical minerals firms flock to US opportunities | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australian-critical-minerals-firms-flock-us-opportunities-2025-09-23/)

* **Australian rare earths, graphite firms eye US expansion**
* **Large, developed customer base is key attraction**
* **Investors show interest in critical minerals projects, execs say**

MELBOURNE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Some of Australia's most advanced critical minerals producers are moving forward on plans to build processing facilities in the United States, despite Australia's strategic push to build up its own domestic industry. An Australian delegation of critical minerals companies visited Washington and New York last week to meet senior administration officials and investors. ASX-listed firms including Australian Strategic Materials [(ASM.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ASM.AX), Ionic Rare Earths [(IXR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IXR.AX), and International Graphite [(IG6.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/IG6.AX) are looking to expand in the U.S., company executives told Reuters.

The scale of the U.S. customer base is a major attraction, they said, given its rapidly developing electric vehicle, defence, and advanced manufacturing industries, as well as cheap energy and the hefty subsidies it is set to deploy. ""We've identified six states as ones that we're looking at seriously,"" said Chief Legal Officer Annaliese Eames of ASM, which is seeking to expand beyond its rare earths metallization plant in Korea. Of those states, ASM, an $85 million firm, is conducting detailed due diligence, including reviewing sites, in Oklahoma and South Carolina. What drew ASM to the U.S. was more than strong federal and state support and incentives. ""It's the commitment that they're making to grow the entire ecosystem,"" she said.

Some critical minerals firms that supply to customers in defense need to locate nearby for reasons of national security and the series of complex steps in turning raw materials into magnets used in everything from wind power to missiles. That is the case for Ionic Rare Earths, which is planning to replicate the magnet recycling technology it has developed in Belfast in several U.S. states, including Tennessee, where it is in advanced discussions, Managing Director Tim Harrison said. ""There are a number of other states that can provide very low cost of power... They also have a lower labor cost base and they have both federal and state governments that are willing to deploy immense funding,"" he told [Reuters.International](http://Reuters.International) Graphite, which is building an advanced processing plant in Western Australia, is also looking at options to build in the U.S. and Europe, to be more closely aligned to the specific requirements of its customers, CEO Andrew Worland said. China's restrictions on rare earths exports [in April](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) galvanized the U.S. to supercharge its rare earths industry, and higher Western world prices that have emerged are attracting investors and greasing the wheels of project finance. Even so, acess to U.S. funding is expected to be highly competitive. Australia's Lynas Rare Earths [(LYC.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LYC.AX), the biggest supplier outside China, warned last month that its heavy rare-earths processing plant in Texas may not go ahead after the Trump administration provided multibillion dollar funding to its U.S. rival.

# POLICY CHALLENGES

The trend highlights critical policy challenges in Australia that are impeding the government's ambition to develop new export markets beyond its mainstay fossil fuels. That opportunity was worth A$170 billion ($112 billion) to its economy by 2040, according to a PwC report as recently as 2023.""Australia has been struggling to set up the critical minerals industry beyond primary extraction,"" PwC Australia chief economist Amy Lomas said. Australia's high power and labor costs, and a cumbersome approvals process, are dragging on growth and diminishing the country's international competitiveness, major miners regularly [complain](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bhp-flags-organic-copper-growth-us-allure-silent-big-buyouts-2025-09-15/). Meanwhile, advanced manufacturing is still a small sector, its development clipped by the closure of Australia's car industry in the 2010s.""For an Australian company to look at building it in Australia, where do we sell our materials? Where is the metals, alloys, magnet capacity being built? It’s not being built in Australia because our cost base is too expensive and we have minimal advanced manufacturing industry,"" Ionic's Harrison said. Still, Australia passed a A$17 billion production tax credit in February that will provide a 10% offset for critical minerals processors from 2027. It is also building critical minerals partnerships with allies including Japan, India and Britain that could deepen its customer base, PwC's Lomas added.

**American Rare Earths (** [**(AU:ARR)**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/au:arr?utm_source=msn.com&amp;utm_medium=referral) **) just unveiled an announcement.**

American Rare Earths has completed test mining and primary crushing of approximately 3,080 tonnes of rare earth ore at the Cowboy State Mine, part of the Halleck Creek deposit. The company is conducting comminution optimization tests on 13.7 tonnes of ore samples to improve rare earth magnet element recoveries and project economics. The remaining ore will be used as feedstock for a demonstration plant, which will validate processing methods and support future technical studies. These efforts are expected to enhance the company’s position in the domestic permanent magnet industry and increase stakeholder confidence.

# SEPT. 22nd, 2025~US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto

[US buys scandium oxide from Rio Tinto](https://www.financial-world.org/news/news/financial/28947/us-buys-scandium-oxide-from-rio-tinto/)

https://preview.redd.it/v2wsy6wlxvqf1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44f8a5f123757f6819aa59df812be17fbe3b19b

**The Logistics Agency of the US Ministry of Defense (DLA) plans to buy scandium oxide worth up to 40 million dollars from a branch of the mining company Rio Tinto in the next five years.** The goal is to replenish strategic stocks for military and technological needs. Scandium is one of the rare earth minerals, and its role in military devices and advanced technology is crucial. Currently, the largest producer is China, which has introduced strict export controls.

""Until recently, we sourced scandium primarily from China. In late 2024, China introduced scandium export controls that limited the supply chain and prompted us to purchase for National Defense supplies,"" according to a DLA document released last week. 

**The plan is to buy a total of 6.4 tons of scandium oxide in the next five years, which in the first year amounts to almost two tons or about five percent of last year's total global production. Last year, according to the data of the American Geological Survey, 40 tons of scandium oxide were produced, with a total capacity of 80 tons.**

**In order to encourage domestic production, the US in August granted $10 million to Elk Creek Resources, an arm of the mining company NioCorp Developments, which plans to produce scandium in Nebraska. Until then, America had to import metal from abroad, and Rio Tinto was the only seller capable of meeting the state's needs in the required quantities.**

The management of the British-Australian company refused to comment on business details, **but it was pointed out that it is ""actively working with the US government to explore opportunities and take advantage of government support for greater domestic production and stabilization of the supply chain"".** In 2020, Rio Tinto researchers developed a process to extract high-purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production.

The company in Quebec, Canada, has been producing scandium oxide for three years, and the current capacity is three tons per year. ""Rio Tinto is in a unique position and can help supply materials critical to America's future,"" management told Reuters.

# 📌 DFARS, Defense Primes &amp; Scandium: Why the Timing Matters

The Reuters scoop (Sept. 22) confirms the Defense Logistics Agency just opened a $40M, 5-year scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto to shore up the National Defense Stockpile. **But even more important — it explicitly cites the $10M U.S. award to Elk Creek Resources (NioCorp) in August to accelerate domestic scandium production.**

**Here’s why it matters: under DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), U.S. primes (Lockheed, RTX, Northrop, etc.) must prioritize secure, domestic, non-adversary sources for critical minerals. Rio Tinto can provide a stopgap, but it’s Canadian, limited in scale, and lacks downstream alloying. NioCorp is the only U.S. upstream solution with a mine-to-alloy roadmap, and Mark Smith already confirmed (Sept. 8 Wainwright event) that two ScAl alloy pathways + a defense partnership announcement are slated for November.**

# CMMC Final Rule: Key Takeaways for Defense Contractors

# IMHO~The Bottom Line:

# The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) just paid a contract price of $6,250/kg!— a strong benchmark for federal price support.*

**This pricing level is especially significant for NioCorp, which received a $10 million U.S. award in August to accelerate domestic scandium production. Unlike other suppliers, NioCorp plans to vertically integrate: producing scandium oxide, refining it into metal, and alloying it into Scandium-Aluminum (ScAl) alloys —** the form required by defense and aerospace primes under DFARS regulations. That integrated pathway allows NioCorp to potentially capture a similar material pricing (\~$6,250/kg) but also additional alloy-level premiums moving forward.

**In short, the DLA contract sets a price floor, confirms real demand, and validates the economics behind NioCorp’s business model. With federal buyers already valuing scandium this highly and policy driving secure domestic sourcing, NioCorp’s mine-to-alloy strategy is aligned perfectly to meet DFARS-compliant defense demand!**

# The Setup Before the Strike

Tomorrow kicks off NioCorp’s biggest showcase week in years: the **RedChip investor presentation at 4:15 PM EST (Sept. 24)** followed by **Mark Smith live with Maria Bartiromo at 7:30 AM EST (Sept. 25)**. That sequence is deliberate — first, Wall Street and institutions get the technical roadmap, then the very next morning the retail base and national audience hear the story on Fox Business. It’s a one-two punch engineered to maximize visibility.

But the real kicker dropped this week: **Reuters confirmed that the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency just awarded Rio Tinto a $40M scandium oxide contract (6.4 tonnes over five years)**, paying the equivalent of **\~$6,250/kg Sc₂O₃** (≈$9,600/kg scandium metal-equivalent). **That sets a** ***price floor*** **for Scandium in defense supply chains —** and with NioCorp potentially funded to advance utilities and site prep, **and with Mark Smith openly teasing Scandium alloy partnerships and November announcements, the timing could not be sharper.** Elk Creek is positioned to be **the only U.S. upstream source of Scandium** at scale, meaning the DLA’s stopgap with Rio Tinto is just that — a bridge until domestic supply comes online.

Put together, the picture is clear: **Phase 1 drilling complete with assays due mid-October, Scandium alloy breakthroughs lined up for November, and a Q4 DFS that folds in all upside just as EXIM/DFC financing comes to a head.** Against a backdrop of new federal critical mineral funding and active Pentagon stockpiling, NioCorp isn’t just a niobium play anymore — it’s becoming the cornerstone of a **North American multi-metal critical minerals complex.** Translation: the table is set, the catalysts are stacked, and starting tomorrow, the ignition sequence begins.

🚀 **Bottom line:** **Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine.” It’s shaping into the U.S. Resource Independence Keystone — Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and rare earths all under one roof.**

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2029 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Logistics Agency is seeking to buy scandium oxide worth up to $40 million over the next five years from a unit of mining giant Rio Tinto to secure supplies of the critical material for addition to the national stockpile.Scandium is one of the rare earth elements, whose importance to the Western defence and technology sectors has been in the spotlight since China, the main producer, imposed [export controls](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/what-know-about-chinas-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-06-04/).

""Scandium, until recently, was primarily sourced from China.

Rodom sam iz Srebrenice. Retko dolazim, ali kad i dođem, uvek odem do Gubera (nekadašnjeg lokaliteta banje Guber). To je pravo čudo prirode: zemljište je obogaćeno kojekakvim rudama (izvinite, ne znam pravi izraz za to), vode koje protiču kroz samu banju su lekovite zbog tih ruda, sama korita/izvorišta su crvene boje, vazduh je neverovatno kvalitetan, itd itd.

E pa, danas sam otišla do gore, i čuvena očna voda jedva kaplje. Vraćam se kući, pitam moje šta se desilo, a majka mi kaže da je Rio Tinto počeo sa testiranjem kopanja negde oko rudnika Sase, što je poremetilo linije tih voda. Rekla mi je da je neko pre nekoliko meseci objavio sliku gde je korito neke od voda bilo ljubičasto.

Šokirala sam se apsolutno, ne mogu da verujem šta se radi. Bukvalno ne mogu da dođem sebi, ne mogu da verujem da će ono mesto koje je tako posebno i važno meni i mojoj porodici od malena, potencijalno kroz nekoliko godina biti jalovište.

Ovo sve pišem da bih podigla svest o ovome i da postavim pitanje: može li se nešto uraditi povodom toga?

Edit: Htela sam samo još da dodam da je banja kao takva pre rata radila punom parom, mnogi su se ljudi lečili tu, i moji praprababa/dedovi iz Srbije. Takođe, banja je unikatna u Evropi. Rimljani su isto tu napravili prokop (da bi prenosili rude do Sasa, to prokopište se i dalje nalazi tu i vidi lepo).

&gt;Valquírio, o tio do homem que matou Josué 'Boxista', na madrugada de 4 de maio, durante uma rixa no exterior de um bar, na Rua Escura, no Porto, foi morto com três tiros ao início da tarde desta terça-feira, em Rio Tinto, Gondomar.

&gt;O homicídio aconteceu num posto de combustível, perto do quartel dos Bombeiros da Areosa, quando Valquírio se encontrava dentro do carro. No local, esteve um forte aparato policial, elementos dos bombeiros de Rio Tinto e do INEM.

&gt;As autoridades acreditam que o crime possa tratar-se de um ajuste de contas.

&gt;Recorde-se de que, na madrugada de 4 de maio, Josué Maia, conhecido por 'Boxista', de 24 anos, ter-se-á desentendido com algumas pessoas no local e acabou por desferir um murro a Valquírio, tio de Daniel 'Cenoura'. Por vingança pela agressão ao tio, 'Cenoura' sacou de uma arma de fogo, já no exterior do bar, e atingiu Josué a tiro no tórax, junto ao braço esquerdo.

Pratico normalmente no solinca arrabida mas ja fui ao gaiashopping, dragao e uma vez ao classic da maia todos eles muito semelhantes sendo o dragao de facto o melhor (sei que levou um upgrade) todos eles justificam o preço acima da media. Porem decidi ir ao de rio tinto recentemente e fiquei pasmado com a diferença para os outros. A area de musculação é minúscula (apenas uma rack/bench de cada???) e a idade de certas maquinas (as smith parecem da guerra do ultramar). Se fosse franchising ate entendia mas sendo todos geridos pelo mesmo grupo acho que o solinca poderia investir mais neste local visto a falta de ginasios em rio tinto e o preço obviamente (quase 60 por qualidade de vivagym).

Deu me vibes do ginasio que frequentava na minha terrinha quando era adolescente a diferença é que pagava 15 euros por mes e nao 60. 

Espero que ele sofra um upgrade pois fica me mais perto do que o dragao ou gaia mas no estado atual mesmo a horas mortas é dificil fazer um bom treino.

Sei que alguns dos que mencionei sao ex holmes palace e bastante mais recentes (menos de 1 ano etc) mas a diferença é noite e dia.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:17.848115,2025-03-25T01:15:33,Rio Tinto,2025

Sure there are unfit tourists but most locals have rock hard abs and humongous muscles. Imagine an average looking guy like me (178cm height, 15% bodyfat, skinny af, average face) would feel like. Getting mogged by like 9/10 men walking up and down the street. 

What does all this equate to you may ask? How would people react when they see someone who doesn’t exactly “fit the scene” so to speak. As a “non beach hunk” you’re 100% invisible to the women. I would cold approach hundreds everyday for weeks in places like Copacabana and Ipanema. Even in Lapa I tried. I got the same answer every single time: I’m married/ I have a boyfriend. And if there were single women they usually give an explanation on why they’re not looking to date. As a normal guy I don’t recommend Rio. I’m leaning to a small town in Colombia for dating and relationships if that’s your whole intention. Otherwise it’s a terrific city with a lot of tourist attractions and I did enjoy the surfing activity and beach soccer. But the whole cold approach factor was quite disappointing. I mean, you can’t even use your social status (being American) to generate a tiny bit of interest in people. It’s not like Thailand/Philippines where being American is “exotic” lol

Many dream of living there, even though most Brazilians themselves wouldn’t necessarily choose Rio as their ideal place to live.

It almost feels like a “Paris effect,” where the city’s global image sometimes overshadows its realities. But unlike Paris, Rio doesn’t really hide its contradictions, beauty and problems exist side by side.

What’s also interesting is that Brazil has been breaking records in international tourism lately. According to recent data, Rio alone saw a 51% increase in foreign visitors compared to last year. The city’s international appeal seems stronger than ever, even though locals often see it with more caution.

Even among my own European friends, I’ve noticed a shift: instead of planning a Eurotrip or the classic “European summer,” many now dream of spending their summer in Rio, treating it like their own version of a “Euro summer.” Honestly, I find this surprising.


Why do you think foreigners romanticize Rio so much?

Is it the beaches, the Carnival, the landscapes, or the “myth” of Brazilian lifestyle?

And if you’ve been there, how did reality compare to your expectations?",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:30.145187,2025-09-11T06:26:04,RIO,2025

Especially with that last one, whenever I saw in a movie or TV show that someone got lost in the woods, I always thought that could never happen to me. I have a good sense of direction, I consider myself capable, I simply didn’t understand how someone couldn’t retrace their steps back to the starting point. Well, that overconfidence landed me in one of those situations I thought would never happen to me: getting lost in a forest. Well, not exactly a forest, it was the Morro da Urca, a hill in Rio de Janeiro right next to one of the city’s most famous peaks, Sugarloaf Mountain. It was a short but terrible experience that left me with a good story to tell and feeling a bit humiliated. To explain what happened, I need to start with how the day began.

It was a Thursday, and my wife and I decided to visit Sugarloaf Mountain, which is a hill on the bay of Rio de Janeiro. The way to get there is by cable car from the Bondinho Park. From there, the cable car takes you to the first station on Morro da Urca, a smaller hill right next to Sugarloaf. At the top of that hill, there’s a restaurant, some shops, and the next cable car station that takes you up to Sugarloaf itself. We did the whole tour, walking through the viewpoints, taking pictures, and having a good day. By sunset, we came down from Sugarloaf to Morro da Urca (the first hill) for an event they host on certain days, where a DJ mixes dance music as the sun goes down. The event lasted till about 6:00 p.m., when it was already dark. Both hills and the park close at 8:00 p.m.

Suddenly, everyone wanted to go down on the cable cars, and the line was massive. My wife and I decided to wait a while, having a couple of beers while the line shrank. But an hour later, it was even longer. I estimated, without exaggerating, that standing in line would take nearly two hours. Another 30 minutes passed, and the line seemed to have grown even more. We couldn’t believe so many people were still trying to go down. Then we noticed a group of about six people heading toward a trail to go down. Turns out there’s a hiking trail down the hill. At the moment, it seemed like a good idea. I thought we could skip the line and be at the bottom in 20–30 minutes, it would even be a small adventure. Big mistake.

I asked the guard at the trail exit, and he said we had to go to an office and sign a liability waiver, releasing the park from any responsibility if something happened to us on the trail. Of course, what could happen? We signed it, came back, and by then there was no one else going that way. My wife and I were the only ones. The guard calmly led us to the gate, opened it, we walked through, he wished us good night, closed the gate behind us, and left. I have to say, the casual attitude of everyone, the waiver office lady, the guard, fed my confidence that this would be an easy walk down. I’ve hiked other trails before, and while some are tiring, they’ve never been a big deal. So between my usual overconfidence and the staff’s attitude, I thought, “No problem. In 20 minutes we’ll be down, and it’ll have been a mini adventure.” I turned on my iPhone flashlight since the trail was completely dark, and off we went.

Well, the trail kept getting narrower and steeper until we reached a point where I wasn’t sure we were even on the trail anymore. After trying to continue in a few different directions, it was clear we were no longer on the right path, maybe 20 minutes had passed. We decided to retrace our steps back to the park entrance, and that’s when the fear of feeling lost began, because going back, we couldn’t find the starting point. It seems impossible, and whoever reads this might think we’re idiots, but really, several factors contribute to getting you disoriented. It wasn’t our first time hiking, but it’s shocking how quickly we got lost. After a while of not being able to find the entrance, I told my wife our only option was to try to go down somehow, no matter what.

By then I was getting really nervous because the park must have been closing, and we couldn’t hear any noise in the distance. My phone had about 25% battery, my wife’s only 5%. Just like in a movie. What followed were about two hours of false trails, arguing among ourselves in the darkness: “It’s this way!” “No, it’s that way!” “We came from there!” “No, we didn’t!” “We already passed this log.” “No, we didn’t.” Every tree looked the same, every trunk the same, every plant the same. The vegetation was dense, we couldn’t see the moon, we couldn’t see city lights because of the dense vegetation, the terrain was steep, everything was slanted —it’s a hill after all— and we only had an iPhone flashlight.

“This can’t be,” I thought. “We can’t be lost. We’re in a city, not a real forest. Civilization is only 600 or 700 meters away. (About 2,000–2,300 feet)” And for those who know Morro da Urca or at least have seen pictures, you might say, “It’s just a hill, how could you get lost there?” Well, it’s not a small hill. From a distance it looks small, but in reality, it’s quite large. I couldn’t find the exact surface area of Morro da Urca, but together with Sugarloaf, they cover 91.5 hectares (roughly 226 acres). Morro da Urca is 220 meters high (about 720 feet), and the trail, I googled later —idiot—, is 1.5 kilometers long (just under a mile), but normally takes about 45 to 60 minutes. So it’s not like getting lost on a tiny hill.

[The small buildings at the bottom of this illustration are around 7 to 8 stories high. This pic won't show the dimension but gives you a slight idea of the geography there.](https://preview.redd.it/la5g8v2j4rkf1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50d3ce9a5826d4701ddbb77a6f08b0cc08f8c405)

You might also think: “It’s a hill, just walk in any direction until you reach the bottom.” Logical, right? Except that when we tried, all we found were cliffs, ravines, or vegetation so dense we couldn’t pass. A fun fact I discovered: the hill is full of thorny plants… and I was wearing shorts. We reached a point where we couldn’t go any further, every path seemed harder, it was pitch dark, the phone batteries were running low, and reality set in: yes, we were lost. Yes, we needed to be rescued somehow.

[One would think it's just a trail down a hill, well it's not that small of a hill nor a trail.](https://preview.redd.it/clvq8z6d5rkf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a739288f4c8421df19448a29d4c063473eaa7e4)

My wife had the very obvious idea—which hadn’t even occurred to me—of shouting for help. In Spanish (we’re Mexican), in English, in Portuguese, she shouted at the top of her lungs. Reflecting on that later, I realized why I hadn’t thought of it: I think men are programmed to believe we don’t need help, that we can always get ourselves out of any situation. A very stupid way of thinking, but deeply ingrained. I told my wife I was going to call emergency services since my phone still had some battery. I was reluctant to doing it before because it felt humiliating but also because I thought somehow we were going to set a whole thing in motion that would probably cost us money. I could picture the morning news story: “Two stupid Mexican tourists had to be rescued from Morro da Urca last night”. I called, a recording said, “For English, press star.” I pressed star. Someone answered in Portuguese. I asked if they spoke English or Spanish, no, they didn’t. With my terrible Portuguese, I tried to explain. Out of frustration, I spoke very slowly in Spanish, hoping they would understand. I said we were lost on Morro da Urca and asked if they could alert a park ranger. “Wait a moment,” they said, and put me on hold for a few minutes. I don’t think they understood. Meanwhile, my wife kept shouting, and then we heard a shout from up the hill. She shouted again, another reply. “They found us!” my wife said. “Hang up!” I did.

After shouting back and forth, we saw a flashlight from above. “Você pode me ver?” I asked in Portuguese (Can you see me?). “Sim, vejo!” they replied (Yes, I see you). More voices above. At least now we knew the park staff knew we were there. They shouted for us to go right. “Sua direita ou minha“ (Your right or mine?) I asked. They signaled with the flashlight, far away but visible. We started moving in that direction, constantly shouting so they could track our position. A few minutes later, we heard voices closer, at our level. We shouted, they shouted back. I had never felt so vulnerable yet so relieved to know help was coming. Finally, we saw the flashlight beam pointing at us. “Here!” we shouted waving our arms, like castaways spotting a rescue helicopter. When they reached us, My wife looked at me as if to say, “Holy crap, we made it!” I laugh now when I think about it.

At last, we were found: three park workers with flashlights, one with a rope. They asked if we were okay, if we had any injuries. They led us back, about 10 minutes walking, to the spot we had started from. Pavement, civilization. Out of that green hell that, under the iPhone light, looked more black-and-white. They offered us water. I hadn’t noticed how sweaty and thirsty I was. We must have looked ridiculous, with our tourist clothes, a tote bag from a Danish museum and iPhones. Just a couple of dumb tourists who tried the trail and got lost.

We had been lost about three hours, but it felt like six or seven. When I checked the time, I couldn’t believe it had been so short. Darkness, disorientation, and fear stretch time. They said they’d take us to a cable car to go down. My wife asked if there was any dangerous wildlife on the hill. “Only snakes” they replied.

Normally there are two big enclosed cable cars on service, that hold 65 people each, but the workers use a small open one, like a metal basket. We got on that one with them and began the descent. “Nobody else gets to ride this,” I thought. “At least I got a VIP trip.” While descending I looked back at the hill, it was much bigger than the picture I had in my mind, all cliffs around. “Lucky we didn’t fall off one,” I thought.

I asked the workers if we were the first ones to get lost. “No.” One asked where we were from. I told them. Representing Mexico. We reached the bottom, they led us out, we said goodbye and thanked them profusely. We walked onto the street as if nothing had happened, hard to believe just minutes earlier we had been contemplating spending the night on the hill, waiting for daylight. We walked about 200 meters (around 650 feet) to call an Uber. I looked back, and the park staff were still there, waving goodbye. I waved back. Five minutes later, we were in an Uber on the way to our flat, with a few scratches and cuts, but laughing.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:30.145592,2025-08-23T21:12:34,RIO,2025

No obstante, no creo que valiera la pena. Es decir, había unas vistas espectaculares, pero el resto de las actividades turísticas nos decepcionaron. O eran muy cortas, o no mostraron nada. 

Lo que debería haber sido el punto álgido de la visita, el tren, fue bastante incómodo y demasiado largo. Duró una hora y media y como fue un recorrido de ida y vuelta, empezamos a aburrirnos un poco. 

Es una pena, porque sí que me había parecido interesante. Creo que vamos a visitar las minas de Almadén también, espero que ahí la visita sea más interesante. ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:44:52.929998,2025-09-05T16:57:47,RioTinto,2025

Let me remind everyone that Palantir had extremely positive news that would have brought the stock to new ATH if not for lock up expiration fear. It seems that everyone have forgotten how value-adding they are.

\*\***Palantir's software has proven its value and is highly sought after (but are forgotten/neglected)**:\*\*  
Prior to lockup expiration, Palantir have signed contracts that are gigantic. These news would have brought the stock to new ATH if not for lock up expiration fear. It seems that everyone have forgotten how value-adding they are. Those contracts has not changed, and the stock should adjust soon as people eventually see Palantir's true value.

\*\***Strong Company Growth &amp; CEO's confident and goal set on long term**:\*\*  
In the Q4 Earnings Presentation, Alex Karp started off by saying Palantir's numbers is an lagging indicator of the macro transition that is taking place. The person who understand the business and company the most in this world, is basically telling you to buy the fking stock as its value is not reflected. He then said this software is going to be the future, it was a luxury in the past but a necessity now and in the future as companies emerge as winners using Palantir. Palantir also helps with company transitions.

Alex Karp then politely ask short-term investors to f-off and diss the wallstreet analysts who doubted palantir and how palantir time and time proven itself, diss the other tech companies who serve wallstreet and thus failed and also not serving long-term goals and average investors, basically mentioned confidently on how Palantir is going to strive in the future; which also means moon now in the short-term due to how undervalued the price is now.

To end off, he mentioned AT LEAST 45% revenue growth for the next 5 years, 4 bil revenue or more by 2025 then.For those who dont know, in Q3, Alex Karp confidently mentioned AT LEAST 30% revenue growth, and he delivered 47% revenue growth in Q4. (cant post youtube videos, ""Palantir CEO Alex Karp on Software &amp; Society""

**Overlooked/Underestimated Earnings Report &amp; Fake News**:  
This brings me to my next point, i have no fking idea how all the media is publishing that PLTR has a -0.08 EPS , falling short of expectation of 0.02. The true EPS of PLTR is 0.06, a 200% beat instead.

Anyway, stock employee compensation should not matter when evaluating a growth company, you are evaluating the company's performance and revenue performance. Stock Employee Compensation is high when the share price is high, and it will be reduced significantly as the employees' compensation contracts expire in the future.

The future Earnings Report is going to look insane because since the media and everyone is factoring Employee Stock Compensation now, which is a huge cost, imagine the Earnings report with at least 45% revenue growth and reduction of Employee Stock Compensation.

\*\***Anticipated demand in regards to lock up expiration:**\*\*  
Everyone was selling off and waiting to buy in at the lock up expiration, IBM news got pltr up $10, to only sell off by $14 despite a good Earnings report. Many waited to buy the dip, bears will saying to buy the dips at \~$10s. they missed the last dip at $25. I expect much more demands to come in.

dk why people get so offended whenever PLTR is mentioned as a meme stock, the truth is PLTR really was a meme stock, justbecause wsb used to make many funny memes about PLTR. No, making memes about the company cannot and does not change how good the company and its software is.  
P.S. would really like to see funny memes about PLTR back on WSB.

1. 55k shares @ 1.10 avg

2. This was not written by chatGPT

3. Idc if you think this is P&amp;D or scam (like most in this chat or pennies in general depending who you ask)

4. This could go to $0.00

RailVision $RVSN is at a point where it actually makes sense to start a position. I, like many others, jumped the gun and bought this as it was going up at the end of 2024 in hopes history would repeat itself with some sort of January run up. 

I've see comments or posts from those who have gotten burned by this stock saying ""rail is dead"", ""it's a dying industry"", ""they're reluctant to adopt technology or change their ways"". All of these are uneducated remarks. But from the outside, I guess you could see them as potentially accurate. However, I wanted to provide those uneducated folks with some information so they could decide if now is the right time to get on the train before it leaves the station.

  
RailVision is mostly if not entirely out of the R&amp;D phase which is why their financials are/have been garbage (another popular comment on why this stock sucks). I'm not going to argue that their financials are great by any means. However, I will say that it *should* only get better exponentially from here. (Late march 2025 earnings will show 2H 2024)

  
They have a ton of things going on.

MOU with Sujan to enter the India Market

Patents in Japan and US

Initial order of 10 units with Israel Railways

Lorem order

Central American trial

An order for trial at 1 of the 6 class 1 rails in the US

Rio Tinto trial via Hitatchi

Partners with KB one of the largest rail/train manufacturers suppliers in the world.

There are other things in the works that we're not aware of yet and if you ask me, thats a ton of accomplishments in the short amount of time the company has been around. They are working to engineer, pilot, produce and implement a solution that is desperately needed in the Rail industry. Please also keep in mind that 

About 7-10**%** of the world's total freight is moved by rail. This varies significantly by region:

* **North America:** Rail moves about 40% of freight, primarily bulk commodities like coal, grain, and chemicals.
* **Europe:** Rail accounts for about 18% of freight transportation.
* **Asia (China, India, Russia):** Rail plays a significant role, with Russia moving nearly 87% of its freight by rail, while China relies heavily on rail for inland bulk cargo.

* **Passenger Transportation:** Rail represents **2-3%** globally but can exceed **20%** in countries with extensive rail networks like Japan, China, and parts of Europe.

Below are some things to keep in mind:

* Class I – Revenue greater than $250M per year
* Class II – Revenue between $20M and $250M per year
* Class III – Revenue less than $20M

Here are the 6 class I rails in US 

* [BNSF Railway](https://www.railstate.com/category/bnsf/) – $23.9 Billion Revenue, 32,500 route miles, 35,000 employees.
* [Union Pacific Railroad](https://www.railstate.com/category/union-pacific/) – $24.1 Billion Revenue, 32,100 route miles, 32,100 employees.
* CSX Transportation – $14.7 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 25,000 employees.
* Norfolk Southern Railway – $12.2 Billion Revenue, 21,200 route miles, 20,000 employees.
* [Canadian National Railway](https://www.railstate.com/category/canadian-national/) – $12.5 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 24,000 employees.
* [CPKC](https://www.railstate.com/category/cpkc/) – Estimated $9 Billion Revenue, 20,000 route miles, 19,000 employees after the merger of Canadian Pacific Railway and Kansas City Southern Railway. 

If you look at every SINGLE ONE of these rail companies and their use of AI/technology you would think twice about making the comment that ""Rail is dead, reluctant to change, don't embrace technology"". They have made DRASTIC improvements to their technology infrastructure and the amount of money they're spending in this component of their business is staggering.

Comments from annual reports of Class I rail companies

*""consistently increasing our annual investment in core infrastructure and spending $1.7 billion out of a total approximately $2.3 billion capital budget on track, bridge and signal projects and in our equipment and detection technology in 2024""*

*""using autonomous track assessment cars (“ATACs”) to gather critical data on track conditions and send the data in near real time for assessment and, if necessary, expedited track repair.""*

*""implementing and maintaining an extensive drone safety program that uses unmanned aerial vehicles to perform a wide range of tasks, including aerial mapping of yards, facility inspection, storm response, accident investigation and law enforcement;""*

*""The Automated Inspection Portal is a sophisticated visualization system that provides real-time train inspection as trains travel at track speeds. Leveraging ultra high definition panoramic cameras, as well as infrared lighting, a full 360° view of the train and the undercarriage is captured. The Automated Inspection Portal utilizes machine vision applications, a subcategory of artificial intelligence with deep learning capabilities""*

*""Our infrastructure and technology investments create safer operations across our network, reducing accidents and injuries, and protecting communities and the environment.""*  
  
*""Technology is essential to driving safety and advancing innovations into all aspects of our operations. In addition, capital investments support track and railway infrastructure maintenance to support safe and efficient operations. ""*

*""BNSF's capital budget of$3.92 billion includes activities that support out efficiency and long term growth objectives in safety and reliability""*

*""2024 capital budget is $3.94. $2.88 billion devoted to maintaining our locomotives, assets and technology infrastructure""*

*""$441 million will be allocated for technology, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment acquisitions.""*

  
NOW, if you've stuck with me this far you can see from a small snapshot of ONLY US based orgs (which are far behind in size, revenue and utilization compared to India, japan etc) that the numbers associated with these organizations are large. Their income is high, their expenditures are high and they are INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY. They are way ahead of where most people think in regards to using AI, Drones, LiDar and other means to increase efficiencies and their safety.

  
Where RVSN comes into play:

We need a SMALL market share of these gigantic numbers to move the SP higher. Now that we're through R&amp;D, actively securing trials and partnerships, I believe this will be a staple solution for many of the rail companies around the world.

For those that thought this was going to be a quick pump to double digits, sorry. I dont think there is anything ""quick"" about the rail industry in general. However, I DO think RVSN is poised to become a big player in the AI obstacle detection space and as they continue to gain support from REAL World applications their SP and growth with reflect so.

The sky is the limit for this company if they can secure POs for the various trials they're in, move things forward with Sujan, and continue to work on getting their product out there.

To caveat ALL of this, this is still a penny stock, a company in it's infancy, and a huge risk from an investment perspective. But, if you're investing money you can stand to part ways with, than this might be an opportunity for you to get in with a company on the ground floor. The company needs to prove themselves, prove they can be smart with their money and prove that their product is in fact needed by the industry. If they can do those things, I believe this will be in double digits by 2026.

Oh and i guess for some reason I'm supposed to include this disclaimer: This is NFA.

Cheers

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, &amp; **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&amp;GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN  to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Dont forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the 4Q earnings

11)  If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.

PLTR, a baby of Cathie Wood &amp; Alex Karp.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀TLDR: PLTR  🚀 , buy PLTR.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.718335,2021-03-07T06:48:09,Rio Tinto,2021
415,y151sr,Are Rio Tinto shares a good investment?,TheMoneyCog,/r/TheMoneyCog/comments/y151sr/are_rio_tinto_shares_a_good_investment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMoneyCog/comments/y151sr/are_rio_tinto_shares_a_good_investment/,1,1,1665482475.0,"**Rio Tinto Plc** ([LSE:RIO](https://themoneycog.com/tickers/lserio-l)) shares are down about 2% year-to-date and flat over the past year, that’s roughly in line with the FTSE 100. And considering how tumultuous the stock market has been lately, these shares seem to be holding up quite well.

Does that make them a good investment for my portfolio? Or should I be looking elsewhere for other attractive investment opportunities?

**Originally Published on** [**The Money Cog**](https://themoneycog.com/news/are-rio-tinto-shares-a-good-investment/)

# What does Rio Tinto do?

Rio Tinto was founded in 1873. Today it’s a leading global mining and mineral resources company headquartered in London.

The firm engages in the mining and processing of aluminium, iron ore, copper, diamonds, gold, salt, lithium, borates, and titanium dioxide. Its diversified portfolio of mining sites is scattered around the world. It currently has over 50,000 employees operating across 36 countries and six continents. However, its flagship projects predominantly reside in Western Australia and North America.

Rio Tinto shares first debuted on the London Stock Exchange in 1973. The share price has increased in the last decade by around 55%. And in the previous five years, it’s up by 38%. That’s ahead of the FTSE 100’s performance.

The numbers may seem unimpressive. But it’s worth noting that Rio Tinto shares have consistently offered an average dividend yield of around 8% throughout its history. And following the latest surge in commodity prices, today’s yield stands at a whopping 11.3%!

So, seeing this stock be a darling amongst income and institutional investors is hardly surprising. In fact, as of February 2022, over 70% of the shares outstanding are held by investment funds. In my eyes, that speaks volumes of the trust financial institutions have in the future performance of this business.

# What does the key financial information say?

Rio Tinto’s fiscal year end on 31 December. And in July earlier this year, the group released its interim results.

Generally, 2022 has been an unprecedented year for most industries. And Rio Tinto shares are no exception. Financially and production-wise, the company’s performance in H1 2022 was below its performance in the same period of 2021 on the back of weakening commodity prices.

Net cash generated from operating activities fell by 23% versus 2021 levels. However, it’s actually up by 80% when compared to 2020 levels. Similarly, free cash flow is also down by 30% year-on-year but up by 154% compared to the first half of 2020.

Net earnings in the last six months came in at $8.9bn — that’s 28% lower than the 2021 first half. And its $15.6bn underlying EBITDA is also down by 26%.

Given these double-digit declines across the board, it may seem strange that Rio Tinto shares haven’t dropped off a cliff. But this performance slowdown wasn’t unexpected since 2021 was an exceptional year for the commodity price of many resources.

To the joy of Rio Tinto shareholders, the company continues to pay a sizable dividend. In fact, in the latest report, management declared an additional $4.3bn is being paid out. That’s the second-highest interim dividend announced in the entire history of the business and equates to a 50% payout ratio.

As of 30 June 2022, the company had net cash of $291m compared to $1.58bn at the end of 2021. This massive reduction stems from the aforementioned dividend payout as well as an [$825m acquisition of the Rincon lithium project.](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-completes-acquisition-of-Rincon-lithium-project)

# What risks do Rio Tinto shares have?

No business is without risk. Before investing or buying the shares of any company, I try to understand the various threats it has to face.

The leadership team categories the company’s risk profile into three sections:

* **Operational** — Threats to mining and refining activities. Luckily there have been no fatalities in the last three years from accidents.
* **Economic** — Fluctuations in macroeconomic factors and commodity prices.
* **Strategic** — Acquiring the right talent and investing in new value-building projects.

But there are additional threats on the horizon that Rio Tinto still need to address. The biggest one in my eyes is the push towards net zero emissions.

It’s no secret that mining isn’t good for the environment. And that’s already placing the firm in the crosshairs of activists and new green government policies. Management has laid out plans to invest $7.5bn in green energy and carbon abatement projects between 2022 and 2030. But whether this will be sufficient, only time will tell.

# Should I invest £1,000 in Rio Tinto right now?

Mining stocks are a cyclical stock market sector. They go through multi-year periods of growth followed by underwhelming periods of decline in a loop defined by the fluctuations in the commodity markets.

Where we are in the current cycle is anyone’s best guess. While many assume we’re near the peak of the growth cycle, continued demand for investments in renewable technologies could mean the cycle has plenty more to deliver.

Looking at the valuation today, Rio Tinto stock is trading at only five times earnings. That, to me, looks cheap. And when paired with an impressive 11% dividend yield, I can’t help but feel a buying opportunity may have emerged.

It’s possible that the decline of the commodity cycle may have started. And if that’s the case, I could be looking at a value trap here.

But given the continued need for metals like copper, lithium, and iron ore, amongst others, I’m confident Rio Tinto shares can deliver plenty of long-term passive income. That’s why I’m considering adding £1,000 worth of stock to my portfolio today.

#SpyGate

Bo 'Nick' Zhao, a Chinese born Australian goes to ASIO telling them he's been offered a $1million from the Chinese Government to run as a Liberal Party candidate and then infiltrate the Australian Parliament as a Chinese Spy.

He then turns up dead in a Melbourne hotel room in March.

Enter Gladys Liu, the Liberal Candidate with a host of concerning connections to the Chinese Government who earns Liberal pre-selection thanks to miraculously raising a million dollars in donations.

Fairfax then discovered a photo of Liu at her home with Nick Zhao in the back ground.

Gladys is now the Liberal Member for Chisolm.

#grassgate

A property owned by Energy Minister Angus Taylor's brother was alleged to have illegally burned 30 hectares of native grassland classified as endangered under existing environment laws.

After Angus Taylor personally intervened and met with then Environment Minsiter Josh Frydenberg about the investigation into his brother, the Government suddenly announced a review into the part of Commonwealth environment laws that specifically deals with endangered native grasses.

#SportsRorts

Over $100million in grants to sporting clubs were handed out according to a colour coded spreadsheet showing if the clubs were in marginal or potentially winnable electorates.

The Government overruled the recommendations of the Sports Commission 300 times, instead giving photo ops to LNP candidates just before the election.

The PM denied any involvement despite extensive email evidence showing his office was calling the shots.

#Robodebt

In 2016, the Government set up an automated debt recovery mechanism to recover welfare overpayments.

However the calculations used by the system were deeply flawed and demanded repayments from thousands who hadn't been overpaid a cent.

To make matters worse, the new process reversed the onus of proof on the recipient to prove they hadn't been overpaid.

Over 2000 Australians died after receiving Robodebt notices. A large (although unknown) number have been attributed to self harm.

In 2020, the Government finally admitted the system was flawed and paid back or forgave $1.2billion in debts.

#CovidCommissionGate

Morrison hand picks a Gas Company Chairman to run a ""Covid Commission"" to plan Australia's post-Covid economy.

He was paid $500k for 6 months work. He eventually recommends tax payers underwrite a ""gas led"" recovery. The shares for the company he works for rises 8%.

#FoxtelGate2

When Foxtel missed out a $100million pandemic rescue package, News Corp execs wrote directly to Coalition Ministers to complain and immediately received $17.5 in tax payer grants.

When the ABC requested copies of the communication under FOI, the Government refused stating that it would damage the relationship between the Sports Minister and the PM.

#SharmaShareGate

As the Government was deciding whether or not to bail out Virgin Airlines, MP Dave Sharma purchased shares in Virgin's biggest competitor, Qantas.

Months later, just before Morrison announced an agreement with CSL to make millions of doses of a Covid vaccine, Sharma just happened to have bought CSL shares.

Between August 2018 and May 2019, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne awarded over $98million in multiple contracts to defence contractor Elbit Systems.

In December 2020, the moment Pyne's 18 month lobbying exclusion had passed for former Ministers, Pyne's lobbying firm was hired by Elbit Systems for an unknown fee.

Since the Mine's opening, mine tailings have simply been dumped Aikwa river, leading to the disappearance of native fish, and the deaths of many Papuans. In addition, there are fears that mine waste may be seeping into local groundwater. Charges have also been brought against the two companies for exploiting local workers, who are often tricked into becoming independent contractors instead of full-time employees, or simply falsely reported as such, in an effort to dodge wage and working condition requirements, and to expose the workers to dangerous working conditions filled with aforementioned toxic mine waste without consequences. There are also lingering suspicions that companies may have bribed local officials to overlook infractions, though evidence for these claims is somewhat skimpy. Nonetheless, these claims will be investigated, and any complicit officials will be brought to justice.

&gt; Rio Tinto needs to repair its standing in the community after its decision to blow up 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara so that it could mine more iron ore, the new chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, says.

&gt; Stausholm on Wednesday night also committed BHP to reduce its scope 3 carbon emissions, which come from its customers, as part of a previously announced &amp;quot;Ambition&amp;quot; to reach net zero emissions by 2050.The chief executive was delivering the company&amp;#039;s full-year profit result after last month replacing Jean-S&amp;eacute;bastien Jacques who was among the executives to leave the company following the Juukan Gorge scandal.

&gt; The PKKP said they were reluctant to continue working with Rio, accusing the company of breaching an undertaking that iron ore boss Ivan Vella would handle the process.

&gt; &amp;quot;For Rio, not only did we have to learn to live with the global pandemic, but the events at Juukan Gorge were a terrible chapter in Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s history,&amp;quot; Stausholm said.

&gt; &amp;quot;Today let me reiterate, the rock shelters at Juukan should never have been touched. We should have dealt with the situation better. It was a dark day for Rio Tinto, for all our employees, and for me personally. It rightly caused considerable damage to many of our relationships, but in particular, with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, for whom it was a devastating breach of trust.""

&gt; The company is following the lead set by key competitor Rio by committing to reducing scope 3 emissions - something Rio has in the past said is largely up to its customers.

&gt; Rio Tinto has repeated its apology to traditional owners for the destruction of a rock shelter that had been occupied for more than 46,000 years, after its iron ore chief executive, Chris Salisbury, reportedly told a staff meeting that the apology was for any distress caused, not an admission the company had done wrong.

&gt; According to the Australian Financial Review, which says it heard a recording of a Rio Tinto staff meeting held last Wednesday, Salisbury described the events leading up to the detonation of the site, then said: &amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s why we haven&amp;#039;t apologised for the event itself, per se, but apologised for the distress the event caused.""

&gt; In a statement to Guardian Australia on Monday, Salisbury did not contradict the report but said: &amp;quot;Consistent with my conversations directly with the PKKP people over recent weeks, Rio Tinto apologises for what happened at Juukan Gorge.""

&gt; &amp;quot;Rio Tinto employees are hurting and I am personally distressed. We are committed to learning from this incident and doing all we can to improve. We are working closely with the PKKP to find a clear way forward on future plans for the Juukan Gorge.""

&gt; The staff meeting occurred as Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s UK-based chairman, Simon Thompson, was meeting with top shareholders who had proclaimed themselves &amp;quot;Deeply concerned&amp;quot; about the destruction of the site and Rio&amp;#039;s management of the matter.

&gt; The federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, told the ABC last week that the relationship between Rio Tinto and traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples, was at the beginning &amp;quot;Quite strong, at different intervals it appeared to be still strong, but when it came to the crunch of mining in a location the elders weren&amp;#039;t included&amp;quot;.

This was exhausting to compile and i spent many hours on it. I made sure to include sources throughout the DD as i encourage people to do their own DD. Things in bold are either directly from RVSN or what i deem important.

I have deliberately left out India and Central America from this DD. Whilst the potential from them is huge especially India I decided to focus my attention onto the things that will generate cash quicker for RVSN then Central America and India. This does not mean I am bearish on them or believe that they are rabbit holes that lead to no where. I just wanted to condense this DD as it is already rather large.

**---------- START OF REPORT ------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

I want to start this report by highlighting the fact that I believe RVSN is making all the right moves for an explosive growth in sales. This includes forming relationships with key players in the industry specifically distributors and manufacturers as well as getting regulatory approval across different continents. **As noted by RVSN “We are investing in efforts to create and develop collaborations with leading train manufacturers. These collaborations are meant to be long-term, with the aim of integrating our railway detection systems into the future production lines of these train manufacturers. We believe that the railway detection systems we develop will be an integral part of future trains, and therefore it is important to invest marketing efforts as early as possible to promote partnerships with train manufacturers and increase market adoption of our railway detection systems.”**

You can think of this as akin to how seatbelts were first introduced to cars. They came as an option and quickly turned into a requirement. RVSN seem to be going down this road inserting themselves into the manufacturing process. Instead of working hard to sell a few hundred systems a year to a train operator they could be shipped out on brand new trains which would substantially increase sales as well as sales to existing locomotives already in service.

On March 18, 2023, the Company revealed its intention to **broaden its sales operations in the US by collaborating with a top distributor** to promote its unique products. Furthermore, Rail Vision aims to solidify its standing as a premier provider of safety products by directly engaging with and selling to industry leaders, Class I railroad companies, and top-tier players within the US railway sector.

They have also secured regulatory approval throughout the whole of Europe. A new photo in the 20-F filing shows RVSN tech on a German train (this photo was fed through AI to google lens that confirmed it was a German train and the colour scheme matched German trains.

And regulatory approval in Israel

**Now to address the main Bearish concerns I see ----------------------------------------------------------**

**Their mailing address is a PO box on sec forms.**

* This is typical for a company. They lease a 16900 square foot establishment for their company at a rate of 26k usd a month.

**They are a dilution scam**

* The majority of companies in the same stage of RVSN (early commercialization of product) dilute. How else would they acquire the money to actually start producing their product after RnD? It was either dilute which brings the price down and adds shares to the float or go bankrupt where you lose all your money. At least this has a chance of rebounding compared to losing 100% from bankruptcy. It was necessary to dilute and does not indicate RVSN is a scam company.
   * There was a third option which was to take a loan out. However with interest payments the dilution was the lesser of the two “evils” for the interest of the company

**Reverse Split**

* This is a possibility if we don’t breach the $1 mark by the 3^(rd) of September. I am confident by then we will have significant PR relating to Israel which I will list down below. RVSN hit 94c off no news at all recently (10^(th) February 2025). It is a fair assumption that if RVSN lands a contract with Israel we will fly past $1 at which the 180 days resets again if we fall back below $1. Also keep in mind that the $3.17 pump happened off just a 300k payment. $1 is not a lot if a decent contract is landed
   * RVSN just achieved regulatory approval with Israel in late December. This gives us 9 months to achieve a PR relating to a contract with Israel from the date of regulatory approval.
      * **“Achieving certification is a testament to Rail Vision’s dedication to excellence and our commitment to meeting industry compliance requirements,” said Shahar Hania, CEO of Rail Vision. “We have met the strict certification standard, which aims to enable Israel Railways’ future plans of high-volume procurement of Rail Vision products and services.”**

**They have failed all their pilots**

* This is simply not true. Rio was thought as failed but the recent 20-F filing stated
   * “The long-term pilot was concluded in August 2022. Following the completion of the long-term pilot, the company submitted a summary report of the pilot. As of today, we have not received any formal response from Rio Tinto relating to the next phase. **To the best of our knowledge, the next phase of the project is a tender due to be published by in the second quarter of 2025 in which we expect to participate in”**
   * I do not take Rio into consideration when making my decision to buy sell or hold but I do think the potential from it is enough to be included into this DD which I will include into the Australia part down below.

**The CEO is a fraud**

* The CEO took a pay cut the last 2 years to improve the financials of the company. This is not actions indicative of a fraud. A fraud would milk the company asap before investors caught on that it was a scam company and abandoned it

**It will struggle to go up because of dilution**

* The dilution occurred mainly before the pump to $3. This pump to $3.17 was predominantly based off a 300k payment from Israel.

**It will experience significant selling pressure due to those getting out**

* We have experienced capitulation. The worst of the selling pressure is behind us

**They have no way of generating revenue after contracts**

**Israel DD -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Israel Railways are Spending 18,106,688,963 USD on upgrading railways.

[https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-840631](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-840631)

First of all, I need to explain the link between Alstom and Israel. Alstom is a train manufacturer that is one of the world leaders in innovation and the digitalization of the industry. With an employee base of over 80,000 in 63 countries they are a major force. RVSN announced they achieved the **approval to install their tech on Alstom trains in March 2024.** This collaboration is huge alone and should put to rest any concerns about RVSN tech being a “failure” **It also paves the way for Alstom to include RVSN technology in the manufacturing process which is what RVSN is working towards and referenced in their 20-F**

RVSN has achieved regulatory approval in Israel. In the press release from December 2024 it states that now it has achieved regulatory approval Israel can now proceed with its **plans of a “high-volume procurement of RVSN products and services.** Furthermore, in the latest report from RVSN in the 20-F it gives an update on the Israel contract. **“The potential sales opportunity with Israel Railways for our Main Line System is for installations on up to 300 trains, and assuming we can negotiate bidirectional installation, the potential sale opportunity could be doubled to install up to 600 MainLine systems”** This number increased from 400 last year to 600 this year (the numbers released in the reports) This substantial increase might be related to Alstom recently signing a contract worth more then 700 million euros (total contract for all parties is 1 billion euros (in addition to their other contracts with Israel Railways)

**North America -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

RVSN seem to be doing a lot of work in North America. Joining MxV roadmap program RVSN is positioning themselves rather well. By joining the MxV Rail’s Technology Roadmap Program, **Rail Vision will contribute to the development of interoperable requirements,** positioning itself as a pivotal player in the evolution of rail technology in the U.S. The involvement aligns Rail Vision with influential stakeholders, including Class 1 U.S. rail operators, and enhances its visibility among potential customers seeking innovative safety and automation solutions\*\*.\*\*

RVSN have 2 on going pilots in North America as well. In a PR dated 15^(th) of April 2024 they noted “**On March 18, 2023, the Company revealed its intention to broaden its sales operations in the US by collaborating with a top distributor to promote its unique products. Furthermore, Rail Vision aims to solidify its standing as a premier provider of safety products by directly engaging with and selling to industry leaders, Class I railroad companies, and top-tier players within the US railway sector.”**

Since then the company has started 2 pilots with major US companies listed below

**June 10th 2024 (Company #1)**

RVSN installs a shunting yard product for a class 1 freight rail company in the US. No figures provided. Probably a minimal order. This order was completing an order made in March. **The freight company is described as one of the largest in North America.** In March it was disclosed this would be for evaluation and testing scenarios related to safety. So we have a potential contract with a huge US based company coming up. Its been 10 months since testing began. An update is due soon

[https://ir.railvision.io/news-releases/news-release-details/rail-vision-successfully-installs-ai-driven-system-class-1-usa](https://ir.railvision.io/news-releases/news-release-details/rail-vision-successfully-installs-ai-driven-system-class-1-usa)

**June 14th 2024 (Company #2 LORAM)**

Fulfilled a deal made in April with LORAM. This installation fulfills the purchase order announced on April 3, 2024, and marks the beginning of a pilot project aimed at enhancing Loram's rail track maintenance operations with Rail Vision’s advanced technology. Pending a successful pilot completion, the two companies will consider an expansion of this product, further integrating Rail Vision's innovative solutions into Loram's rail vehicles across the United States.

**November 18th 2024 (Company #3) Not a pilot**

Developed in collaboration with a major U.S.-based rail company, Rail Vision’s new system transitions from passive warning systems to active safety systems that directly control locomotive throttle and brakes, setting a new step towards autonomous rail operations.

This next-generation capability, tailored for shunting yard locomotives, leverages Rail Vision’s proprietary AI technology to provide real-time insights integrated into the customer’s locomotive control systems. The system will be deployed as part of the initial rollout on the customer’s U.S. fleet, with implementation starting by the end of 2024. No income was seen in the EoY report for 2024. **Implementation can take a long time (look at how long Israel took) so no news is not negative. 2025 will be interesting in regards to this.**

This tailored solution suggests a bigger payday then a standard order of RVSN tech as it was customised for the customer. It also uses the wording **rollout** with **implementation starting by the end of 2024.** So the rollout should of begun now. **Rollout suggesting multiple units not just 1 or 2.**

**Latin America ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Some quick information on Vale. Vale own over 800 locomotives and more than 35,000 freight cars. They have committed to spending 12b usd on upgrading their operations overall. **On the railroads where RVSN tech was spotted which are the Carajas railroads they are operating 300 locomotives and around 24,000 wagons.** An average of 22 pairs of EFC trains circulate per day. They are purchasing 50 more locomotives to be shared between the Carajas railroad and Vitoria a Minas railroad.

In July 2024 RSVN successfully deployed their system with a Latin American mining giant.

Whilst the company isnt mentioned, Vale has been connected and a vale train has been spotted and photographed with a RVSN mainline system on it in the same region **that Vale have announced they are planning a huge upgrade to its rail system.**

[**https://imgur.com/a/i6DtXLt**](https://imgur.com/a/i6DtXLt) The train that was spotted with RVSN tech

https://preview.redd.it/7clsqyunjhse1.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d5f0ade3f659f83e9106c059b0c7bba3c57c9b4

July 2024 was when the Mainline system was installed. **Going off other RVSN press releases a trial would go for up to 6 months. RVSN mentioned in a press release “over the upcoming months” so we can assume that the trial ended.** The job posting RVSN from and announced huge upgrade to the network along with RVSN tech already being there points towards a contract being won with Vale. The job posting was for a “Director of Product” which indicates the product is finalized and ready to go into sales. Proficiency of Spanish or Portuguese is mentioned which also further adds to the thesis that a contract is on the verge of being finalized with Vale.

So there is 300 locomotives in the region where the RVSN tech was spotted on that train. **Assuming bidirectional capabilities that could potentially be up to another 600 systems for the Vale part of RVSN in just the Carajas region alone.**  If Vale are happy with the technology they could add the systems to locomotives outside of the Carajas region which makes sense if the tech works as RVSN describes (saves money, improves efficiency, reduces accidents). There is no reason to believe Vale would not apply this technology to trains outside of the Carajas region especially with the budget they are working with to upgrade their operations.

**Australia ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

The potential for a deal with Rio is huge. **Shahar (CEO) was recently at a conference in Australia dominated by speakers from Rio.** This might be a coincidence but when you take into account the number of derailments Rio has had since the trial it could be seen as strategic. It was thought that the Rio pilot had failed until the recent 20-F filing which stated that the **next phase of the trial is a tender due to be published in the second quarter of 2025. Rio did not award a contract to the Australian competitor 4AI. Its autonomous trains do not currently possess the ability to see obstacles.**

Rio currently operate automated trains however these have experienced 3 significant derailments in 12 months (2 in 2024) and another derailment in 2023 since the pilot ended which showcase an urgent need for technology such as what RVSN is providing.

In 2022 Rio experienced 2 derailments in the space of 3 months.

It should be noted that Rio operates worldwide and if a contract is won in Australia there is no reason why they could not award RVSN contracts for its other locomotives around the world.

**Competitors and why RVSN tech is better then the competitors -----------------------------------------**

Going through the 20-F filing there is a table of 9 competitors. **Out of 9 only 1 has achieved standardization which is Bosch Engineering. This is important as RVSN have been laying the groundwork for regulatory approval in many countries unlike most of the competitors**. The Bosch system also has a high false alarm rate and is only designed for the LRV market which is light rail. **This does not intrude on RVSNs current plans on working on products for Shunting yard and Freight / passenger trains.**

**Some key notes on why RVSN tech is better then the competitors technology**

* Predictive maintenance feature due to continuous monitoring of the railway tracks on which it travels. **This helps provide a return on the investment of RVSN technology by the customer**
* **The ability to detect unique classifications such as forward and backward switches which are extremely important and can only be done using vision technology due to resolution limitations that currently exist in other technologies.**
   * **“Our railway detection system is designed to detect and classify objects, indict their location on the track and the distance from the locomotive, and detect the position of the switch. The switch is a device that is part of the railway track and is used to switch between two adjacent tracks or merge two tracks into one track. It is important to detect the position of the switch because the switch selects the train’s continued direction from the main track line on which the train is currently riding to another rail.”**
* Detection system is based on passive technology that combines video images and thermal images unlike other railway detection systems currently being developed or used that use radars or lasers which are prone to higher false rates. **Currently there is no other system that can match RVSN in terms of obstacle detection at a distance of 2 kilometers.**
* RVSN tech compared to LIDAR technology are able to **classify obstacles at longer distances also not just detect them.**
* Being based on passive technology RVSN tech is not exposed to interference due to hot spots or reflection overload. Other technologies such as radar are sensitive to the presence of metallic objects such as screws, springs etc which are often found on or near railway tracks.

If it's a repost, I'll take the other down tomorrow.

 

TL;DR: Q1 is beating earnings by 14% or more.  Stock price 29 at year end.  Yes, this is my bullish case - a 30% increase over current price at time of writing - premarket 4/21 current price $22. Short term prediction q1 earning sends stock to 27 with a beat earnings of 20% q1, it sits back down after excitement.  EOY (end of year) has Revenue per share of 35 still (my biggest bear sentiment) and overall revenue for PLTR is 1.5B+ for the year.  Tons of space open for beating my estimates in total revenue and stock price EOY.  Addendum - with sleep deprivation setting in and the view of  the new Back Office Software - I think this could realistically hit 30+ on the quarter, but I doubt it will stay there until EOY without more Wall Street support.

Game start:

Listen, I’m a teacher.  A music teacher.  Not a math teacher.  Not some super smart college professor. I’m a 29 year old, middle-high school band and chorus teacher that lurks in r/anime and plays as much video games as he can.  I have skin in the game with PLTR and needed some DD that wasn’t “Yay new contract, time to buy the dip.”  I present a bullish case with a lot of bear ideas (though maybe not enough!).  Use this DD to form your own opinions and as already stated, I’m nobody you should take financial advice from, I’ve never even taken a financing course, though you may want to take a few of these ideas.

Let's start with what we know.  We have some companies with contracts disclosed, some we just know have contracts, and the earnings report from Q4.  This leads into making guesses and postulating about the Q1 into a total yearly revenue which finally leads to my guesstimations.

Episode 1: Q1 2020, the Dark Ages

This is the dark ages of Palantir, my beautiful trading app TDAmeritrade and many others did not disclose what Q1 was for PLTR, only giving Q2-Q4.  I initially added those up, saw that totaled PLTR’s total revenue, then took Q2 and divided it in 2.  For a makeshift Idea on Q1, that left me with a 240.5M revenue from Q1.  Well, I found out that [https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue](https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue) has the revenue listed at 229.33M.  I’m already happy my guesses are bullish.

Episode 2: Q4 2020, Tons of useful information.

PLTR revenue of 322M.

Individual customer’s average 7.9 million (Henceforth 7.9M) per year which is up 41% Year over year (YOY).  

The number of customers they had was 139.  

The top 20 customers made up 61% of their revenue, which is down from 67% YOY, meaning they MAY make more money from smaller contracts in this quarter and beyond.  I did not give the smaller accounts the benefit this time due to bullish top 20 contract stocks.

Episode 3: Known Contracts.

Assuming all things equal, which they definitely aren’t, but I needed SOMETHING to base my numbers off of with these contracts, I presume the contracts PLTR procures are spread evenly across every quarter the contract is effective.  Reminder, I teach music to children, for the more informed, I ask you to educate me and others on corporation contracts, it seems that usually there is a lump sum in the beginning, then a nice bonus at some point, say 50%-100% down the line?  But for this, understand that I used an AVERAGE OF THE TOTAL OVER THE NUMBER OF QUARTERS THE CONTRACT APPLIES.  This includes the most painful part, pure conjecture. The companies:

NNSA - 5 year 89.9M.  This equates to 20 quarters of pay for PLTR.  89.9/20 = 4.495M/quarter

Army - 1 year 111M that may be on Q4 from December 12ish.  111/4 = 27.75M/quarter

BP - 10 year 1.2BILLION.  1200M/40 = 30M/quarter

Rio Tinto- 5 year (My estimate 700M) 700/20 = 35M/quarter.  This was based on market cap alone.  BP is 84B market cap, Rio is137B market cap and it was labeled “Significant.”  This is my most bullish opinion here IMO, but Some contracts are probably straight up part of Q4, so take that as you will.

PG&amp;E - No listed, (guessed 5 yr 100M.)  100/20 = 5M/quarter I’m guessing they are tired of paying multi-billion dollar fines for forest fires.

Fujitsu - 1 year 8M.  8/4 = 2M/quarter

NHS - 2 year 31.5M.  31.5/8 = 3.938M/quarter  Again, listed In December, I’m bad enough to not know if this is priced in to Q4, remember, check your facts kids.  (I’m 29… you may be older than me and definitely not a kid).

Army ground Modernization - 1 year 8.5M.  8.5/4 = 2.125M/quarter

SOMPO Holdings - 1 year 22.5M.  22.5/4 = 5.625M/Quarter (Listed December 28ish)

Army vantage year 2 opt in on Dec 21…  1 year 113.8M.  113.8/4 = 28.45M/quarter

Just in, A new contract for palantir and Back office software.  This is 1.2B in euros split between 31 companies.  May be uneven.  If 1.2 euro/31 = 46567548.39 american dollars.  (1.2B/31)x1.2 conversion from euro.  Contract is seemingly set until 9 December 2024.  3.5 years or 14 quarters.  46.56M/14 quarters = 3.325M/quarter.  This will not be included below, but helps me be more confident with what I state below.

Additionally we have these companies that likely did not get reported on or I missed:

Skywise, Ringier, World Food Programme, United, NIH, C4ADS, Faurecia, 3M (which is said to be a multimillion dollar contract).  

Episode 4: A Numbers Game with the Big Contracts.

That’s a lot of info and speculation… Let's get you salivating with numbers and more speculation!  I believe my numbers above to be very bullish, so my numbers below will tend to be bearish to try and balance everything out.

Q4 reported 139 customers.  As of 4/21/2020 that number may be around 249 based on [https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue](https://craft.co/palantir-technologies/revenue).   That is a huge increase, more on that later.

139 customers averaged 7.9million to give the total revenue of 1093M

We know the top 20 was 61% of that so 1093Mx.61 is 666.73M,  Just to make sure, let us double check with their average revenue from top 20 customers pulled from their Q4 earnings call.  33.2M avg x 20 customers = 664M  I can’t seem to find the exact number so I’ll use 664M.

20 customers made up 664M annual revenue

119 customers then made up about 429M which is about 39%, this number may need to be lower based on other factors, but for this DD, I leave it.

Episode 5: Looking Forward - Big Contracts for Q1

Lets add our quarterly estimates from the 10 companies earlier.  

28.45+5.625+2.125+3.938+2+5+35+30+27.75+4.495 = 144.383M

To be bearish, let’s assume either these are the top 10 of PLTR, or my numbers ran high and add “only” an extra 100M for the remaining top 10 companies.  144.383+100 =244.383M revenue /quarter.

If this is our starting point, it’s a darn good one.  Last years Q1 was 229.33M in revenue…. So, looks like we already beat that!  So maybe That makes me too bullish (I don’t think it does, but for now, run with me!).   Let's recall that the top 20 only make up 61% of the revenue.  Excited yet?  First let's double check some numbers on the big contracts.

Taking a quick look at the guess, actuals for big contracts in 2020 = 665M/4 = 166.25M/quarter last year.  Our current estimate has them at 244.383M/quarter.  Infeasible?  I think not, but definitely bullish.  YOY growth for top 20 contracts according to Q4 = 34%.  This puts them at a large, but not impossible 47% growth (244.383/166.25) and excitingly, this alone puts the market cap for the year to 244.383Mx4 = 977.5M  (Reminder we had 1100M for 2020).  If this is even possible, 20 customers are nearly paying for the total revenue PLTR had last year, and I think it’s possible.

Average growth last year had average returns of 7.9M for each 139 customers invested.  Breaking this down we get 1.975M a quarter average (7.9M/4).  First, a quick double check of our top 10’s list to see if they are over the average!  Yes, every single one posted beats the average.  That’s a good start.  Big contracts alone should average ((644M/20contracts)/4quarters) = (32.2M a contract/4quarters) = 8.05M/quarter from the big contracts.  Checking our known contracts again, that leaves 5 in question as being one of the top 20, but there are a few that really balance that average out.  The average of 244.383M/20contracts = 12.219 - still well above as mentioned previously with the 47% growth in the top 20 alone.  A very Bullish thesis on the large companies, but we can balance that out in the small contracts.

Episode 5 the small contracts Minus 110.

If our top 20 contracts stand at 244.383 and we will keep the q4 contribution amount to 61%, so let's add in another 39% for the smaller contracts.  For my sake, I fear that any new additions from [https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir) would be WAY too bullish, plus it is untested/unquantifiable data, so let's start with just the base 139 customers from Q4.  

139-(20 bigs) leaves us with 119 smaller contract customers preparing to add 39% to the valuation.  I wish to continue my bear(ish) thesis because otherwise this gets out of hand really fast.  

2020 had a valuation of 1090M total.  61% of 1090 is 664.9M as mentioned earlier, leaving the small contract customers to take 425.1M (1090M-664.9M) which is 39% (I know I could have Math’d it 1090x.39).  

425.1M/119 (again, that’s 139-20bigs) = 3.572M annual revenue from small contracts.  3.572M/4 = .893M/quarter per small company.  

Meaning on average from last year the smaller contracts added .893M 119 times into PLTR.  so .893x119 =106.275M/quarter added from small contracts from last year.  This assumes they are still playing PLTR and we see that number in this earnings report.  This is your friendly reminder that I am absolutely a school teacher, not a financial advisor, because the next part is glorious.

Episode 6: to Glory.

We have the Large contract balance - 244.383M.  

We have the small contracts balance of 106.275M.  

We just have to do some basic math now!  244.383M+106.275M = **350.658M** Q1 2021.    


Who knew it’d be that easy!  WAIT!  There's more.  I told you, glory.  Palantir is all seeing.  They know where to stash some extra coin and added in Q4 597.4M in REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS - RPO’s.  Here comes more speculation, be careful trusting any of this, or you may for once in your life trust a school teacher.  I’m going to be super bearish with this money just in case it is already factored in on the revenue sheet OR my numbers have been jank.  597.4M in cash PLTR will be paid from contracts in years to come as they finish their services, and assuredly renew them.  

597.4M/10YEARS, because I want to be bearish with this number, I haven’t seen a PLTR contract over 10 years long yet, so let's make the entirety of these contracts 10 years, you know, as bears might.  

That is 597.4M/40quarters = 14.935M/quarter additional revenue!  Sweet, let's add that on!  350.658+14.935 = 365.593.  Mmmmm, an even more glorious number than the last.  My only basis is I don’t think that’s added in yet due to 

“Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 states that revenue should be recognized when the seller satisfies their performance obligations. Generally, this occurs when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to customers” - which was a google search that lead to [https://warrenaverett.com/insights/revenue-recognition-step-5-recognizing-revenue-performance-obligations-satisfied/#:\~:text=Accounting%20Standards%20Codification%20(ASC)%20606,services%20is%20transferred%20to%20customers](https://warrenaverett.com/insights/revenue-recognition-step-5-recognizing-revenue-performance-obligations-satisfied/#:~:text=Accounting%20Standards%20Codification%20(ASC)%20606,services%20is%20transferred%20to%20customers)  which is where I got the quote.  Please inform me otherwise, I like to learn, it makes me smarter.

This makes me think it has not been calculated into revenue yet.  YAY!  Nearly 15M more to add onto Q1!

BUT WAIT, THIS TEACHER IS TURNING USED CAR SALESMAN (OR EVEN BETTER BILLY MAYS), THERE'S MORE.  So, maybe you forgot, I didn’t.  There are 100 potential customers we did not account for.  Here is where I think I let you decide.  Allow palantir’s Q1 for 2021 be 365.59M and let the extra 100 be some wrong-proof hedging.  You could throw out this thesis entirely (Please just help me understand my own DD and where I went wrong if you do :)).  Or do you add it on and become the full bull rush that I want to see… long term….  But also short…  because… playing the casino…  So.

Episode 7: The Big Gains.

Looking at earnings PLTR has a 45% growth estimate on Q1 from their guidance from Q4 and the revenue basis of:

229.33M.  229.33x1.45 = 332.5285M expected Q1 revenue.

This calculation puts the guidance under 33M of my DD’s supposed **365.59M** which is a lovely **59% growth YOY** for the quarter and **14% higher than guidance**.  So let's add the 100. :)

Episode 8: Holy Moly There’s More.

Adding the 110 new customers.  I imagine each of the new companies to be less than PLTR’s traditional earnings per customer, being in the acquisition stage or below for PLTR’s stages.  I also fear the validity of the site itself (because we all trust what we see on the internet right?) as I also see this site: [https://discovery.hgdata.com/product/palantir](https://discovery.hgdata.com/product/palantir) listing 1825 companies as using Palantir but the source of 249 again being [https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/palantir).  My belief at the moment that 1825 is not real, and 249 is, but 110 are a much lower valuation.  I can’t explain the discrepancy, but from the earnings statement Palantir provided with these two seemingly unhelpful quotes as to why they don’t match:

""*As of December 31, 2020, we had 139 customers, including leading companies in various commercial sectors as well as government agencies around the world""* p85

*""We define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue in a reporting period. For large government agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  subsidiary  agencies  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  we  treat  each  of  those  agencies  as  a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent""* p85

Being the bear.  110 companies more and not 1700 more.  

If each 110 add .5M contracts a year, this is (.5/4) .125M a quarter.

.125M a quarter x 110 = *13.75M*.  

Add that to our outlook so far (365.59+13.75) $***379.34M***!!!  

379.34/229.33 means a **65.4% growth YOY for the quarte**r! This makes me want to be a bull.

Episode 9: The Final Bull

110 companies adding 1M contract average a year.

.25M a quarter (1M/4).

.25M x 110 companies = *27.5M*

27.5M + our estimated original contracts of 365.59 is ***393.09M*** quarterly revenue.

393.09M quarterly revenue beats 229.33 by (393.09/229.33) **71.4%**! What a massive potential that is. 

This is far beyond my expectations, and **beats estimates by** **26%.**

Episode 10: I watch anime, did you really think that was my full power?

Taking the thesis that the most bearish on the quarter is **332.5285M** with the 100 extra companies being valued in a mistake I made.  This leads to a total revenue EOY of: 

332.53M x 4 which is **1330M** EOY estimated revenue.

Current revenue is 1090M, so Palantir, without doing anything except fulfilling this year's current contracts, no new contracts, no new customers, is growing by 1330/1090 = **22%**.  Oh.  That’s… not as much as I’d hoped.  I mean, it’s good, but it’s nothing *unbelievable*.  But I bring you solace!  Q1 has been PLTR’s worst quarter for at least the last 2 years.  So we are looking at a **minimum of 22% growth**.  That’s nice.  But that doesn’t satisfy my bull nature in this company.

Let us at least add in the 110 possible new customers, because that’s a lot of growth potential on top of a lot of growth.  (139 to 249 is a (249/139) 79% increase).  So lets use the valuation of PLTR with the 110 customers adding .5M, so 379.34M, we can get a market cap of 379.34M x 4 = **1517.36M**.  Without PLTR doing any new collecting, this puts us at a growth YOY for the company to (1517.37/1090) **39%**!!!  That’s what I like to see.  

Episode 11: The play

With the current trend, I expect Palantir to trade around 35 revenue per share. 40B market cap when stocks at 21.6 a share/1093M revenue = current valuation of 35 RPS.  If this growth continues and we hit 1517 Revenue by years end, that puts us up to 53,095M market cap, or 53B  This puts the **stock price to about $29.5 a share**.  BUT WAIT YOUR A BULL.  Yes. 2 things.  First, long term.  Second, operating margin and insider selling will keep the stock from going over 35RPS short term in my opinion.  There are a handful of HUGE catalysts in my opinion that will break the 35revenue barrier.  

Episode 11.5: the 35 revenue barrier aside

The 35 Revenue barrier (currently being broken as I edit this DD) can easily be broken when at looking events like Karp/Cohen et.al. finish their insider selling and exercising all their shares in December quelling fear.  They also have (hopefully) finished paying out most of their taxes on their employee’s stock options which leads to greater margins.  They will hopefully also grow their margins significantly due to ease of implementation and renewed contracts with big companies.

Episode 12: Returns and Final Thoughts

At current share prices of around 22 dollars that is a (29/22) 32% return on investment at present.  I’m no slouch, but I've never made returns that high in investing, maybe it’s because I’m a boomer 29 year old teacher that invests into things like Apple and Nvidia and not dogecoin.  (Yes I got better on NVidia, but didn’t invest heavily due to lack of DD).

Final thoughts, I truly think PLTR will be over 30 a share by years end, but I don’t intend to mislead you by thinking it WILL go higher than that.  Go out, do your own research, even use this for God’s sake, you managed to read through it, and form your own thesis and DD.  I am positive maestro (my musician in me is showing) Cathie Wood will Gladly take a free 30% ROI, likely more, especially if it is a free play for many years to come.  So buy the dips.  Anything under 29 on the year is a buy for me.  I personally have a few calls to make on q1 earnings for the overhype when they beat, sell them off, and let it settle for a while.  

Full disclosure, I presently own 1100 shares of $PLTR with some leaps of $25 and $30 for Jan 23’.  I have been selling cash secured puts and now selling covered calls on my position after I was “forced to buy” last week on my put, but will be stopping that this week, incase other people finally start thinking as bullish as me.  (Which now in editing we finally have a green day, do I even need this DD anymore?)  I am a musician, not a financial advisor, I have never taken a financial course, my math is probably wrong, and you should always, ALWAYS do your own DD.

Afterlog: aside about my DD - Please Critique my DD.

Guys.  I think I need PLTR to consolidate this data for me… What a large amount of time I invested into this company and doing research.  Would you please, *PLEASE* correct anything that you find stocks/company related?  This could potentially save me money, but would definitely enlighten me to doing better DD for myself and possibly others in the future.  As a musician, I know criticism well.  Criticism is the best tool I know for growth besides failure, and I want to grow (And preferably not be wrong, but hey, it happens) (seriously, we learn so well when we fail).  This is my first DD ever, I’ve been lucky with a good handful of stock picks with little to no DD of my own and finally want to start using my brain when dealing with something as important as money.  The more you correct me the better I learn.  Thanks for reading!",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.718661,2021-04-22T07:17:11,Rio Tinto,2021

Cam Wilson

A controversial tech company accused of “fuelling” the Trump administration’s mass deportations and that works with the Israel Defence Forces is increasingly involved with the Australian government and big businesses, sparking unease from digital rights groups. 

Palantir, founded by billionaire Peter Thiel and three others, is a US-based data analysis and tech company. Its Australian government clients include the [Department of Defence](https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/0a592d73-3b04-4bcd-907e-7db4b4761845), the [Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission](https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/98ad1d3a-2550-4652-8935-3be706dc806d), and the [Australian Signals Directorate](https://www.tenders.gov.au/Cn/Show/0cb01a4e-8335-4542-a8e4-2be07b26d576). Its corporate clients include [Coles](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/coles-group-is-making-big-strides-with-its-advanced-analytics-613172), [Rio Tinto](https://im-mining.com/2024/11/14/rio-tinto-to-extend-use-of-palantir-technologies-ai-based-solutions/)and [Westpac](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashwinrrajan_palantir-technologies-are-proud-of-our-longstanding-activity-7064811433145888768--1ft). 

The company has gained notoriety for its work with the military and assisting with government surveillance schemes. Its work with the Israeli military — including reportedly the use of AI tools supporting automated decision-making in the war on Gaza, [according to a recent UN report](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/un-report-lists-companies-complicit-in-israels-genocide-who-are-they) — and with the US administration on [its mass deportation plans](https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/palantirs-immigrationos-fuels-trump-administrations-immigrant-removal-agenda), has brought renewed attention to the company.

Palantir [says](https://blog.palantir.com/palantir-is-still-not-a-data-company-palantir-explained-7-8322d5b38cef) its work assists customers to “integrate and analyse their own data assets to make better decisions”, and that the decisions made with this data are ultimately up to the client. Palantir acknowledged, but did not respond to a media request by the time of publication.

The use of the company’s technology by the Trump administration has prompted more than a dozen former employees to [protest](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html) the partnership.

“Data that is collected for one reason should not be repurposed for other uses,” said one signatory of the open letter. “Combining all that data, even with the noblest of intentions, significantly increases the risk of misuse.”

Now, this protest has come to Australia, with Greens digital rights spokesperson Senator David Shoebridge calling for a freeze on government contracts with Palantir over its overseas work and concerns about how it handles data.

He says the federal government’s use of Palantir shows a need for higher standards around which companies it uses. 

“We need rigorous guidelines in place around government procurement that prevents public money being handed to companies actively engaged in genocide and suppressing democracy,” he told *Crikey*.

“A question the Albanese government needs to answer is, did anyone check these fundamental threats to democracy before signing up with Palantir?”

His comments echo concerns raised with Finance Minister Katy Gallagher and cabinet secretary Andrew Charlton last month by civil society group Digital Rights Watch.

Digital Rights Watch chair Lizzie O’Shea wrote a letter last month to the cabinet members about the “uncertainty about where the data Palantir collects in Australia is being stored and who can access it”. The letter also highlights the national security risks of the government becoming “increasingly dependent on foreign companies to manage our most sensitive data”.

The group’s head of policy Tom Sulston told *Crikey* that the dependence on Palantir was the direct result of a lack of investment in Australia’s own industry and regulatory framework. Now, he said, its growing presence presents a risk.

“With our lax privacy laws, Australians’ information can be taken offshore and used for all sorts of unexpected and unsafe purposes without recourse. It’s more urgent than ever that the government finish the job it started reforming our privacy laws. It also must commit to transparency in its dealings with offshore tech companies, and refuse to deal with entities that have shown disrespect for human rights,” he said. 

The same goes for the corporate sector, where Retail and Fast Food Workers Union secretary Josh Cullinan said the union was blindsided by Palantir’s contract with Coles, which was signed early last year. 

Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1212651



Cullinan said the decision to bring in Palantir reinforced that “Coles, like many other corporate behemoths, \[is\] a sociopathic entity unable to care about those to whom they have a duty of care.” 

While Cullinan said there is no issue with data analysis, the union’s concerns stemmed from previous failures to consider workers’ rights and the unique demands of their jobs when instituting “data-driven” reforms. 

“The data doesn’t identify that a customer with special needs requires more patience and time than others. Or that deliveries get delayed on occasion. Or that no worker should work alone in a department. Or that when workers are abused, threatened or assaulted, the workplace should close until it is safe,” he said in an email.

# Signs $245M contract to stockpile antimony mined in Alaska and refined in Montana.

In a strategic move that will begin replenishing the National Defense Stockpile and anchor domestic supply chains, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has awarded United States Antimony Corporation an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract of up to $245 million for bars of the strategic metalloid produced at the company's smelter in Montana.

""It's incredibly meaningful for all our employees to play such a strategic role in strengthening our nation's defense readiness and having the knowledge, expertise, and history that USAC can and will deliver under our contractual obligations,"" said U.S. Antimony Chairman and CEO Gary Evans.

While antimony has long been considered a strategic metalloid to U.S. military readiness due to its uses in ammunition, fireproofing compounds, night vision optics, and other defense applications, its criticality rose significantly with China's ban on the exports of antimony – alongside gallium, germanium, and graphite – to the U.S. in 2024.

Considering that more than 90% of the global antimony supply is concentrated in China, Tajikistan, and Russia, the ban by Beijing elevated the urgency to establish secure and reliable supplies of this metalloid critical to both military and consumer goods.

As the only domestic antimony smelter, U.S. Antimony is positioned to quickly scale up a supply chain that can begin to meet America's 50-million-pound-per-year antimony demand.

[Layout of U.S. Antimony's smelter in Montana.](https://preview.redd.it/93pum43k23rf1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae0678cc59318921a123ebb2f49a253431afea4b)

# Alaska-to-Montana supply chain

Texas-based U.S. Antimony's stockpiling contract with the U.S. Department of War is the culmination of the company's efforts over the past two years to begin leveraging its small but vital smelter to establish a vertically integrated domestic antimony supply chain with links in Alaska and Montana.

Unlike other companies that have emerged to help meet U.S. demands for antimony at a time when the world's largest supplier has halted exports, U.S. Antimony has been around for nearly six decades – though the New York Stock Exchange-listed company reemerged under new leadership beginning in 2023.

This provenance and reinvigoration positioned USAC as the quickest solution to America's near-emergency need for antimony.

With an operating smelter in place and ""some of the most experienced antimony chemists/metallurgists and other professionals on its team,"" U.S. Antimony only lacked a ready source of antimony ore to feed into its Montana facility.

For this supply, the company turned to Alaska, a state that provided the U.S. military with antimony during both World Wars and has high-grade antimony lying on the ground – ready to be loaded into a truck and sent to Montana.

While U.S. Antimony has acquired several Alaska properties with easily obtainable high-quality antimony, the company selected the Mohawk Antimony (previously known as Ester Dome) project on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city, as the first supply of feedstock for its Montana smelter.

""This project highlights Alaska's important role in America's resource future, while also underscoring USAC's mission to strengthen U.S. critical mineral independence away from foreign adversaries,"" Evans said during a Sept. 8 event that drew municipal, state, and federal policymakers to the Mohawk Antimony project.

Because of the high-grade nature of the antimony found at Mohawk, U.S. Antimony does not need to establish a full-scale mine to secure feedstock for its smelter. As a result, the company quickly gained state approvals for a [site cleanup](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2025/08/22/news/us-antimonys-first-ak-project-cleanup/9232.html) and antimony production operation – and the first antimony was being stockpiled for shipment to Montana shortly after the dignitaries left on Sept. 8.

# Flexible antimony contract

With the signing of a stockpile contract with DLA, metal ingots refined from the Alaska ore will be stacked in a National Defense Stockpile facility. In addition to ensuring the U.S. military has a backup supply of this critical and strategic metalloid, the $245 million contract is supporting U.S. Antimony's efforts to establish a complete domestic antimony supply chain.

""To put this in proper context, we have successfully won a sole-sourced long-term contract from the U.S. Government for approximately $245 million, while our total reported revenues for 2024 were $14.9 million,"" said Evans.

Because it is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract, U.S. Antimony does not have any minimum or maximum obligations – meaning, the company can sell all of the antimony metal it can produce without the added pressure of losing the contract due to not meeting minimum requirements.

With its high-grade antimony supply in Alaska, an operating smelter in Montana, some of the world's top antimony experts on its team, and now a guaranteed buyer for the metal it produces, U.S. Antimony has assembled the pieces needed to help break America's reliance on overseas suppliers for a metalloid critical to both the nation's security and economy.

The contract also represents a broader step by DLA and the Pentagon to begin rebuilding secure domestic supplies of critical minerals – a strategy that is becoming more urgent as China and other foreign suppliers tighten control over access to these essential materials.

# SEPT. 23rd, 2025~The U.S. Air Force confirmed that the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter is already in production

[The U.S. Air Force confirmed that the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter is already in production](https://www.zona-militar.com/en/2025/09/23/the-u-s-air-force-confirmed-that-the-new-sixth-generation-f-47-fighter-is-already-in-production/#google_vignette)

*Framed by the opening ceremony of the latest edition of the Air, Space and Cyber Conference of the AFA, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Chief of Staff, General David W. Allvin, announced that the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter is already in production. In particular, it was indicated that current plans foresee having a first aircraft ready to fly by 2028, which implies following an accelerated construction schedule to meet the proposed goals.*

https://preview.redd.it/q05v4z8843rf1.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=092d5d807ec1ff10411baf82b2ea39a8742315fd

This issue is by no means minor, considering that it set the path to follow in terms of the required range for the future F-47, which would have a combat radius of 1,600 miles to adapt it to potential combat in the Indo-Pacific; that figure represents practically double what the F-22 Raptor can achieve. In addition, as stated by General Allvin, the institution has already even defined the number of units required for future strategies, namely at least 185 aircraft.

Finally, broadening the lens to other relevant aspects of the speech delivered by the USAF Chief of Staff, General Allvin emphasized that the force is also advancing in building up its fleet of B-21 Raider stealth bombers.[ Recently, the arrival of the second such aircraft was observed at Edwards Air Force Base, with it later reported that it will be used for weapons and mission systems testing.](https://www.zona-militar.com/en/2025/09/22/the-second-b-21-raider-stealth-bomber-of-the-u-s-air-force-will-focus-its-flight-testing-on-weapons-and-mission-systems-trials/) On the other hand, the official also took the opportunity to reaffirm that both the force and industry must accelerate the pace to develop future collaborative drones to complement the F-47, a key aspect of the current modernization program.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# IMHO~🚨 Scandium Just Got the Green Light — and NioCorp Is Sitting in the Catbird Seat 🚨

The Defense Logistics Agency just confirmed a $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto at \~$6,250/kg, officially setting a federal price floor and proving DoD is willing to pay up for secure supply. But here’s the kicker: Rio can only deliver limited tonnage, and it’s Canadian. Meanwhile, Elk Creek (NioCorp) just received a $10M U.S. award to accelerate *domestic* scandium production — with a mine-to-metal-to-alloy roadmap that no one else has. ***Under DFARS, primes like Boeing, Lockheed, and RTX are required to prioritize secure U.S. sources, which makes NioCorp the only homegrown solution!***

**Now connect the dots:** the Air Force just announced the **F-47 sixth-gen fighter is entering production for a 2028 first flight**. These jets will demand next-gen alloys like Sc-Al for lighter, stronger, hotter-running airframes. Mark Smith already confirmed two Sc-Al alloy methods are underway, with a defense prime partner reveal coming in November. ***That lines up perfectly with the qualification window primes need for the F-47 program — and explains why DLA’s contract is more than just a stockpile move. It’s a signal that Sc-Al is moving from lab theory to defense procurement reality.***

**Bottom line:** DLA set the price, the F-47 sets the timeline, and NioCorp is the only U.S. player that can deliver. November could be the inflection point where “critical mineral explorer” becomes a “defense-qualified supplier.”  ***T.B.D. &amp; Speculation...***

Employers have warned of an $18bn hit to the economy and “a new $900m cash cow for unions” under a universal portable long service leave scheme they fear Anthony Albanese will implement to bolster union power and revenue streams.

Days out from [Saturday’s election](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics-election-latest-they-are-calling-donald-trump-confirms-anthony-albanese-has-been-trying-to-phone-him-to-discuss-tariffs/live-coverage/de9641fa657b6009b1bf854a698e4742), business leaders have raised concerns that a second-term Albanese government industrial relations agenda will deliver on a key demand from union chiefs to roll out [a national portable entitlements scheme](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/industrial-relations-wars-bosses-slam-portable-leave-plan/news-story/ab0b26217ec75d7f5233d389967f9faf) for casual workers.

After [the Prime Minister ](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/anthony-albanese-notfor-turning-on-super-tax/news-story/6393cc85b0d932e1dbb7610f5bd64157)pushed through [a raft of IR reforms](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/election-2025-business-puts-hard-word-on-peter-dutton-to-gut-ir-laws/news-story/aa9673ea8d45f3af5a38acc0384d8460) in his first term, including multi-employer bargaining, closing loopholes and right to disconnect laws, Labor is expected to revive its commitment to portable schemes that industry leaders believe could force businesses to pay ­billions of dollars in entitlements each year into new union-linked funds.

Industry analysis obtained by The Australian claims there would be an $18bn hit on the economy if portable long service leave schemes were imposed across the economy. Based on existing worker entitlement funds, the analysis says this could deliver a “$900m revenue stream to ­unions”. Business chiefs are also concerned about the potential for employees to “double dip” via different long service leave laws.

Amid private sector concerns about Labor’s IR agenda, the Fair Work Ombudsman issued a warning as left-wing unions prepare to hijack a May Day rally in Sydney on Thursday to voice their anger at the Albanese government for putting the CFMEU’s construction division into administration. The FWO, which encouraged employees who planned to attend to use available leave, said it would monitor and investigate any “potential non-compliance with Commonwealth workplace laws”.

The Victorian Labor government under Daniel Andrews was an early mover on portable entitlements schemes, providing a range of long service, sick and carers leave for workers across disability, aged care, cleaning, retail and hospitality sectors. Other Labor state and territory governments have set-up portable entitlements schemes, including Chris Minns’ NSW government which will launch a portable long service leave scheme for community services workers from July 1. Long service leave is typically accounted for by businesses as a contingent liability. Businesses still retain the actual money themselves as part of their working capital and that remains as a business asset.

Global Nuclear Security Partners Australia's Jasmin Diab discusses the positive effects that nuclear energy has had on an international level. “We are seeing nuclear power roll out all across the world, and economies thriving because of that,” Ms Diab told Sky News host Chris Kenny. “We don’t need to be the experiment to prove it again. “If we want to be serious about reducing carbon emissions … then let's listen to the science and engineering”.

Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable, who represents companies including BHP, Rio Tinto, Glencore and Lynas, said a universal portable long service entitlements scheme would be a “compulsory union tax on every business in Australia”.

“This has nothing to do with protecting worker entitlements, and all to do with creating new income streams for unions to help fuel their political agenda. Worker entitlement funds are unregulated and unaccountable and are notorious for being exploited by unions who skim millions of dollars from these funds for their own profiteering,” Ms Constable told The Australian.

“This will take billions of dollars out of the productive economy, from small businesses to large businesses, and lock it up in union-controlled funds – a massive hit to the economy that Australia cannot afford.”

Pressed last year about the ­Department of Employment consulting on portable leave entitlements and the potential of new federal schemes, Mr Albanese confirmed “the Fair Work Commission are looking at these ­issues”.

“We want to make sure our economy grows and that workers get a share of that growth. That’s been our objective,” Mr Albanese said in February last year.

Federal Labor, which has committed to helping disability workers access portable leave entitlements, has previously stated its support for protecting workers’ entitlements particularly in industries with itinerant patterns of employment.

Asked if Mr Albanese would pursue a second-term IR agenda focused on universal portable long service entitlements or a broader national portable leave scheme, a government spokeswoman said Labor would protect workers from “Peter Dutton’s cuts to pay packets, penalty rates, working form home and the right to disconnect”.

“The Albanese government’s focus is on continuing to lift wages, including by supporting an economically sustainable real wage increase for the lowest paid Australians, banning non-compete clauses in employment contracts and closing the gender pay gap,” the spokeswoman said.

In November last year, the Australian Workers’ Union national conference endorsed a [universal portable long service leave scheme](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/breaking-news/awu-pushes-labor-government-for-universal-portable-long-service-leave/news-story/147de040aacdd26767a9309f6e99c893) to replace existing arrangements where employees accrue paid leave with a single employer.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton says the inheritance tax is part of Labor’s “socialist agenda” and contributed to the near destruction of the Victorian economy. Mr Dutton sat down to take questions from viewers in an 'Ask Me Anything' special edition of Paul Murray. “The Labor party believe it, in inheritance tax every day of the week, Paul – it’s part of their socialist agenda,” Mr Dutton said. “They believe that you’ve got too much money and the person next door to you hasn’t got enough, and how do we find a way to tax you. “They nearly destroyed the economy in Victoria.”

The AWU, which is pushing Mr Albanese and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt to make a portable leave scheme a second-term IR priority, argues that millions of workers are now in insecure work, with 22 per cent in casual roles.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers, a member of the AWU, last week said IR priorities for a re-elected Albanese government would focus on gender and work done by the FWC, the modern awards review and changes to non-compete clauses.

Unions are also lobbying for new rules allowing them to charge non-union members for bargaining done on their behalf and for all new migrant workers arriving in Australia to receive inductions to understand their rights and opportunities to join unions.

Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said this isn’t “just about fairness, it’s about trust, integrity, and putting an end to union slush funds masquerading as worker benefits”. “For too long, these funds have operated in the shadows, with little oversight. It’s time for real accountability. Too many have looked the other way while unions treat these funds like private piggy banks,” Ms Wawn said.

“Workers deserve control over their own money. They should have the right to choose who manages their entitlement contributions and full visibility into how those funds are invested and used.”

Incolink chief executive Erik Locke, who runs Australia’s biggest union-backed worker entitlement scheme associated with the CFMEU and other trades’ unions, last year urged the Albanese government to set-up a national portable leave scheme across the workforce.

Mr Locke said Labor should go beyond its 2022 election pledge to examine a portable leave scheme for insecure workers and look at a nationwide approach that would create a multibillion-dollar system of leave entitlements similar to superannuation.

Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said “long service leave entitlements should generally only accrue where employees actually perform a long period of service with their employer”.

Mr Willox said portable leave schemes were causing major problems for employers given levies of around three per cent that typically apply. He said the cost of portable long service leave is often more than three times the cost of regular long service entitlements. “The last thing that employers and the community needs is for portable long service leave schemes to be expanded,” he said.

A report released this week by the Liberal Party-aligned Menzies Research Centre said union membership had “declined from over 50 per cent of the population in 1976 to just 13 per cent in 2024 and as low as 7.9 per cent in the private sector”.

“Rather than adapting to remain relevant to workers, unions have shifted to alternative revenue sources to remain financially sustainable,” the report said.

“Australia’s largest unions have accumulated well in excess of $1.8bn in assets and generate more than $800m in annual income. In the nearly 20 years for which records are available, since 2006-07, Australian unions have pocketed a grand total of $528,769,384, from worker entitlement, training and superannuation funds.”

Further, the PCE results clearly suggest a very significant uranium mineralizing event has occurred in the Southwest region of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, on an unprecedented well scale and that we are really only at the beginning of defining its true extent. Further, the exciting developments in the uranium market over the quarter, including yesterday's announcement of NexGen doubling the volume in our offtake book, incorporating our key focus of market-related pricing mechanisms, ensuring NexGen Energy deliver industry- leading leverage to future prices whilst providing utilities with confidence with respect to volumes from Rook 1's technically, environmentally and socially operation. All in all, updating the critical role NexGen is set to play in delivering the world this vital clean energy fuel supply.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050.

In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers.

Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet.

According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy.

The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize

U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now.

In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements.

In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits.

None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium.

All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE.

While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly.

Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply.

Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving. With the commission's hearing set for September 25 and February 2026, NexGen is preparing to transition from advanced development to construction and subsequent operations.

Our current cash balance stands at CAD 375 million, with funding to complete the 2025 site programs and initiate development for the first 12 months of post-approval construction. We maintain full strategic optionality with a strong cash position and active engagement with global debt providers, sovereign funds and utilities, amongst others, resulting in financing interest well in excess of the full funding requirements of the build. As we always have, we will optimize the vast number of financing alternatives available for maintaining our production flexibility and ultimately maximizing the value of each pound of uranium we produce and sell.

At PCE during the quarter, NexGen announced our best discovery phase assay today. We drill hole RK-25-232, returning an incredible 15 meters at 15.9% U3O8, including an exceptional peak of 0.5 meters at 68.8%. This is amongst the best exploration intercepts in the world with Arrow hosting the majority of the other top 10. Since discovery, 45 holes at PCE have been resected mineralization. Of these, 12 have produced the ultra-high-grade massive replacement mineralization of over 61,000 counts per

second. We've been bold with our spacing, in some cases, over 200 meters apart and are still intersecting mineralization consistently, demonstrating the continuity of mineralization and the overall strength of the system.

Drilling to date at PCE confirmed the start similarities to the Mighty Arrow deposit just 3.5 Ks away. It's suggesting the early signs of another Tier 1 assay. It really does speak to the vast discovery potential of potentially more deposits on the Rook 1 property in the future. We also recently announced the consolidation of our entire land package, including PCE with the purchase of Rio Tinto's 10% production carried interest. It held on 39 of our claims. NexGen has secured a right of first refusal mechanism over this package after a third party made a bonafide offer to acquire it from Rio. NexGen now holds 100% ownership of all its claims in the district. This speaks to the acceptance by not only NexGen but others of the tremendous value in the Southwestern Athabasca Basin portfolio, which dominates the known and prospective trends in the district, a district which is often referred to as the future of uranium mine.

In response, we have received regulatory approval to expand our exploration infrastructure, including a temporary air strip, road for dualway traffic and expanded accommodations to support a growing team on site. This program is currently underway and scheduled to be completed in Q1 2026.

Our elite standards on responsible development continues to guide every part of the business. In May, we released our fifth annual sustainability report aligned with Global Reporting Initiative and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure Standards, highlighting major advancement across environmental, social and governance metrics. Through our growing education and workforce development programs, over 500 participants have engaged in NexGen-led training initiatives these past 2 years across a wide range of skilled trades. These programs developed in partnership with regional institutions and indigenous communities are designed to build capacity and create meaningful career paths aligned with the project's long-term needs. Indigenous leaders have publicly recognized NexGen's unique and leading collaborative approach with all four of the indigenous nations in the local project area citing NexGen as a benchmark for meaningful indigenous engagement and shared prosperity.

Keeping an eye -- I advise to keep an eye out for a video on our website about Chantelle Herman, who is one of a group of talented local students who have become members of the NexGen team, pursuing highly technical careers at NexGen while still living in their community. Chantelle is one of these leaders in the community and Travis and I met back in 2015 at the National School Volleyball tournament and went on through our summer student program, followed by a scholarship and is now a second year geology student university whilst working as a field geology technician at Rook 1. This is one of many great outcomes from the Rook 1 project and is the foundation of delivering even greater generational advancement of the project as it goes into construction and operation.

NexGen is well advanced on procurement with long lead and critical path items already ordered and in several cases, staged and secured in our warehouse. This progress reflects NexGen's fully integrated execution strategy and proactive supply chain planning, ensuring we are ready to begin major construction immediately upon final regulatory approval. With the team, materials and partnerships in place, Group 1 is execution ready. As we enter the next phase, our focus is clear; conclude approvals, finalize funding and begin building the most important new uranium project in a generation in a manner fully consistent with how NexGen have delivered the best results today across every aspect of the organization. At NexGen, we're advancing with clarity and conviction. We're executing with deep respect for the environment, communities, Saskatchewan, Canada, the world and our shareholders. We are energized by the opportunity to lead the future of nuclear. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to delivering further progress in the second half of the year. Thank you, and we will now open the call to your questions.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] And we will take our first question here coming from Katie Lachapelle with Canaccord.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Congrats on the new offtake. Similar to your previous agreements, you noted that it was a market-related contract. Two questions. Can you confirm if there's floors and ceilings in that new contract? And then as a follow-up, it appears that you're signing better terms relative to what some of your peer companies are announcing. Is that fair to say? And if so, what do you think is giving you that edge?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

I can confirm that our contracts as a blend are very substantially market-related prices at the time of delivery. There's not one contract that fits all. Contracts are very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of either the producer or the emerging producer and also that of the particular circumstances of the utility. I would make a general comment that U.S. utilities and particularly the larger ones do prefer a surety around future pricing. And so what you'll see with those contracts is an embedded floor and ceiling. And where that is the case with NexGen, and I want to say that we have 4 contracts in place, which cover all aspects, floor and ceiling, full spot and then also no floor and an extremely high ceiling. They are, based on our knowledge of the market, very strong relatively. And I think that speaks to a number of things. I think it's an overall assessment by utilities with respect to the state of the current mine supply worldwide. We're seeing some of the historical projects that have been getting back into production, not meeting expectation. And then we're also seeing significant sovereign and technical risk impact some of the current producing centers. So what NexGen represents and also the other advanced developers in Denison, particularly in Canada, is we provide an alternative or a diversified supply of this key important fuel. And I think that then ultimately gets reflected in the pricing from what has occurred in the past to what is actually about to unfold in the future. So I know that's a bit of a long-winded answer, but we are only conveying what we're experiencing, and that is what is driving our contract book.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Awesome. Maybe just one quick follow-up. In the past, you've indicated, I think it was upwards of USD 1.6 billion in lending interest from banks and other credit providers. Is that number around the same? Or has that changed? And now that you've got a couple of these offtake contracts in hand, do you feel like you're getting closer to finalizing an agreement on the debt side?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. And I'll hand over to Travis to answer.

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks, Katie. And as Leigh indicated, yes, it is growing, I would say. There's more parties getting involved seemingly every week, frankly. I think that's on the back of, obviously, all those banks signing that agreement to support the funding of this growth initiative by all these international governments. Also the bank was -- funding of nuclear projects well in excess of that and offtakes, I would say, do help the lending process, but it also opens up potentially new avenues of lending with government as an example. So -- but to be clear, the offtake contracts are being done kind of on an isolated basis based on our acceptance of those terms and everything like there -- it's not like we're conceding on anything that we want long term. So yes, it's very positive, and we're really interested to fund the full project along the time lines that we've indicated in the past, which is end of the year, into Q1 of next year ahead of the approval process. Also debt is one of the alternatives at hand. As Leigh mentioned in the earlier part of the call, we do have a number. I think it should be unsurprising the quality of the asset and which offers, but we have quite a few options at hand to fund the full project.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.

**Andrew D. Wong**

So just maybe back on financing a little bit. With regard to that, as you're having more of these conversations with various partners and there's more and more interest, what's your sense on the most likely path here? Is having a strategic asset or sorry, a strategic partner, the most preferred path and then maybe that's supplemented by debt or equity? Can you maybe just provide a sense on that?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks. Maybe I'll start...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Go ahead, Travis. Do you want to go?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. I would say we don't have a preferred path at this stage, like we're keeping an open mind to all of the avenues at hand. They all come with -- well, first of all, they're all at various stages. I would say all of them are advanced, but obviously, various stages of how advanced they are. And so all of them are attractive in isolation or together. So I would say we're keeping a very open mind with respect to how this ultimately gets funded, although obviously, we are keeping our focus on our ability to be flexible with respect to production volumes and maintaining our leverage to future upside in prices. That's what I would say to that. And Leigh, obviously...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, exactly. Look, our principle is to finance it in a manner that optimizes the production and the return on every pound produced. And we're working both streams, both the equity stream, project equity, debt and also the potential of a prepayment on the future supply of a volume of pounds. Each one of them comes with their costs and benefits, but the overall principle that we will incorporate when we conclude the package is optimizing the exposure to future uranium prices. And whilst we can't be specific on the debt-to- equity percentage or whether it's project equity or not, that will be the guiding principle. And we will be most likely concluding that in the first half of 2026 at the -- subject to respectfully, the conclusion of the CNSC hearing process.

**Andrew D. Wong**

Okay. Great. Then just maybe on the project itself in terms of construction, given that the approval might be coming sometime in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about how the project team is shaping up right now? Can you highlight any construction expertise you've hired or if there are any notable additions recently?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, it's a good question, Andrew, one that we don't make a lot of noise about. But behind the scenes, there's a very well-planned human resource execution that is going on. We've been adding to the team consistently since 2017 in line with the stage of development. Look, there's no doubt we've appointed some people that are ready to go and start constructing this mine. And obviously, we've -- when we've seen a quality hire, we've hired them on board. And they're very -- they're busy. They're not sitting around doing nothing, that's for sure. But -- so I would say on balance, we're probably over employed, but it is going to pay extreme dividends once we have that approval and we're into the construction phase.

The benefit of a long permitting process is it gives you plenty of opportunity to plan, plan, review, plan again and review again and I can tell you the construction plan is down to a finite detail. We know exactly what we're building. It's technically a very simple mine in a mining sense. And we've attracted the best in the business on to the team. We have a combination of both direct employees and consultants, but the overall philosophy of NexGen is that we don't delegate any decision-making. We have a person on the team that takes responsibility for their respective field and that responsibility ultimately rests with Travis and myself and the Board. And so we are very much owner constructor and operator model.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Ralph Profiti with Stifel.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

Leigh and Travis, I just want to delve in a little bit on these two offtake contracts being held to a 5-year term. Was there appetite on the part of the counterparties to move those contracts out to a further tenure? And is what's holding back sort of movement on the floors and the ceilings? Or is this becoming the industry standard? Or I'm just wondering if there's other factors at play, specifically with regards to the tenure?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

We -- the contracts are very different dependent on the actual asset and the utility. There's not one contract that suits all. And that is also reflective of the utilities specific requirements. Utilities have a range of contracts with a range of suppliers and some are short term and some are long term. I would class ours as medium term in terms of length. And we are just at the beginning, we're at 3% of our total defined resources at Arrow. And we all know that the Arrow deposit is much larger and given its inferred resource, which will convert to indicated with subsequently closer space drilling.

I would say our philosophy is -- at the moment, we're negotiating a variety of between 3-year, 5-year and 10-year contracts. And it is really dependent on the specific circumstances of the utility. And those characteristics differ from one region to the next worldwide, like the U.S. utilities have a different preference to the Asian utilities who have a different preference to the European utilities. So I just want to make the point that there's not one contract in this market that fits all. It is very specific to the utility and very specific to the producer. What we offer is obviously a high level of confidence in volume given the technical simplicity of our project. And that is resonating strongly with the utility customers.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And Leigh, you mentioned the Bill C5 a couple of times in your preprepared comments. And now that we're 6 months from that second CNSC hearing, it does sound like there's iterations going on with detailed engineering. I'm just wondering, has there been any scope changes with regards to plant, equipment or components in the design that are directly being driven by Bill C5. And the reason I'm asking is just to kind of think about scope changes in the early preconstruction phase of the project.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Interesting question, but the answer is no. Our scope, there's been absolutely no scope changes whatsoever, full stop, and we wouldn't be contemplating scope changes as a result of Bill C5. Our approach since even prior to discovery has been to deliver an environmentally elite approach along with a socially elite approach. And we have done that. And in every respect, we have exceeded the requirements of the legislation from a technical and environmental perspective. And also from a social perspective, it's well documented that we've been incredibly proactive in engaging and consulting with indigenous communities and implemented programs where there is incredibly strong collaboration between NexGen and the communities. And that actually even extends beyond those that are defined as impacted. So I think Bill C5 is a reflection of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government recognizing that there are elements of duplication to permit a resources project, not just specific to uranium, but major energy and national infrastructure projects. And I absolutely applaud them for recognizing that and introducing legislation that aims to make the whole process more efficient whilst maintaining incredibly high environmental and social standards that Canada leads the world in. So that's why we are in Canada. That absolutely is aligned with our values as an organization, and we are very proud to deliver this project to Canada in line with the very high environmental and social standards that Canadians expect.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from George Ross with Argonaut.

**Unidentified Analyst**

It's Sam. Just in regards to the production carried interest, when is the market going to be informed a little bit more on the cost, et cetera, attached to that?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Well, it's confidential as per the agreement of the clause that triggered it. And so, yes, we are unable to disclose what it means or what the cost was specifically in relation to that acquisition. I will say we are very pleased to have acquired it. We had approached Rio Tinto on it. And then, yes, bonafiding bid was received by an external party, which we do not even know the identity of. And so we triggered our right of first refusal. And whoever that party was, thank you for expediting the process.

**Unidentified Analyst**

Fair enough. Okay. And just in regards to the Patterson trend, any plans to sort of test along strike at this point, Leigh? Or it's very much just going to be focused on sort of defining the higher grades there at PCE?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Our initial focus is to define and extend what we have at PCE. But look, we also have seen the results at Patterson, which is basically an extension of the trend, the Patterson Corridor East trend of our property, and they've hit mineralization as well. And what that says is that the whole conductor is very highly prospective for additional mineralization. As I speak, we've probably explored less than 1% of that actual Patterson Corridor East conductor trend. Similarly, with Arrow, we've explored less than 10% of that particular conductor corridor. And as everyone knows, you've got RRR that's along the Patterson Corridor conductor of our project. So the area is extremely well mineralized, and we are on the cusp or just at the very, very beginning of truly defining its true extent. We have 8 conductor corridors going through the Rook 1 project alone. There's no doubt there's been a significant mineralizing event in the region. And yes, we've put in an exploration camp to facilitate extensive exploration of that region of which we host 320,000 hectares. So it's incredibly exciting. It really is a geological phenom. And we are -- yes, there's a lot of drilling to be done before we can truly hold our hand on our hearts and say, you know what, this is the extent of it.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from \[ Fred Pollard, \] a private investor.

**Unidentified Analyst**

You mentioned Rook 1 is execution ready, and you've been held back, in my view, for some time now awaiting the federal approval process. You mentioned C5, and I have a couple of questions along that theme. So has C5 triggered some conversations with the government on advancing mine approval? And secondly, might there be some movement on the government schedule that you also mentioned earlier in the call? And I ask that because of the principles of fast tracking that are associated with Bill C5.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Thank you for the question. And it's a very topical question. Look, I would say that the introduction of Bill C5 from Prime Minister Carney is absolute recognition that there are some efficiencies that can be gained at the federal level, particularly after provincial approval and the indigenous community approval in the region of a specific project. And he's been very, very clear about that. And as a consequence, he's also going to resource a new project's office to help fast track the federal process. I absolutely applaud Prime Minister Carney and his ministers for that endeavor. I think in reality, the NexGen project is so advanced in the process that these initiatives are going to really benefit other projects that come after NexGen. And so we are resource industry advocates clearly. And we're really excited about that because like NexGen isn't going to fill the gap on its own. The world needs -- with respect to uranium, the world needs 2 to 3 Arrows and they need them now. So I think that's excellent news for every other advanced developer out there looking to get into construction. So specifically to our project, I think the benefit is most likely for other projects behind us, but I absolutely applaud the recognition and the importance that the federal government is placing on the expedition of major projects.

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] Our next question will come from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

**Brian MacArthur**

If I can just go back to the contracts, there's been a lot of talk about floors and ceilings. But can you confirm or deny, I guess, whether there are any volume options in those contracts? It sounds like there isn't the way you're talking about how much is committed, but I'm just trying to figure out how that part of the equation is working in all these contracts.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, Brian, there's no volume discretion in the contracts by the utility or us as the supplier. I'd make -- and that's very clear. I'd make a general statement that the form and structure and pricing of the contracts are changing from what has been done in the past. The environment is changing. And the contracts which we are doing are different and have got different elements to what has been done in the past. And I think you're just going to see that naturally evolve over time as the scarcity and the risk, be it sovereign or technically around supply increases. And so yes, my overall comment is the environment is changing. There's no doubt about it. And what we are conveying to the market is what we are experiencing, and it's different for all companies. And as I said, it's very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of your supply and also very specific to the particular utilities preferences, and they differ between the U.S., Asia and Europe.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. That's very clear. Second thing, can I just confirm there's been a couple of comments about the financing and timing, whether it's year-end or H1 next year and then comments around the CNSC approval. Could you have financing in place before the CNSC approval? And would that be subject to CNSC approval? Or are they sort of dependent on each other? Any comments on that? Just to clarify, I think, would be helpful.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. They're obviously related. And we -- look, if we were approved today, we would have concluded the financing. We've been well prepared for this for many years. But we can't really trigger the financing until we have approval to that extent. So as time -- as that final approval timetable unfolds, so will the financing. And terms or optionality may be better in the future given the way this environment is changing. And so we are just keeping our exposure to that in place. But I can assure you, we will conclude financing in short order post approval.

**Brian MacArthur**

There are just different time horizons talked about. So I was just trying to clarify that. I appreciate it.

**Operator**

And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leigh Curyer for any closing remarks.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Thank you all for listening and joining the Q2 call. Thank you for your questions. We certainly appreciate them and everyone's interest in this incredible project. And Q3 is going to be an incredible quarter ahead of us with everything that we're working on and the conclusion through the end of the year, not just what's happening at NexGen, but driven by what is happening in a very rapidly changing market environment. And we appreciate your interest in our project, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on the milestones that we have articulated.

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NexGen Energy Second Quarter of 2025 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. \[Operator Instructions\] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer and Director with NexGen Energy Limited. Please go ahead, sir.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Thank you, Joseph. Good morning, and thank you for joining NexGen's Q2 2025 Financial Results and Investor Conference Call. My name is Leigh Curyer, and I am Chief Executive Officer. Today, I'm joined by Travis McPherson, Chief Commercial Officer; and Benjamin Salter, Chief Financial Officer.

On today's call, I'll discuss our exciting company advancements, including Rook 1 Project Readiness, Patterson Corridor East results, which strongly validate another significant mineral body is unfolding 3.5 kilometers to the east alongside Arrow. Further, the PCE results clearly suggest a very significant uranium mineralizing event has occurred in the Southwest region of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, on an unprecedented well scale and that we are really only at the beginning of defining its true extent. Further, the exciting developments in the uranium market over the quarter, including yesterday's announcement of NexGen doubling the volume in our offtake book, incorporating our key focus of market-related pricing mechanisms, ensuring NexGen Energy deliver industry- leading leverage to future prices whilst providing utilities with confidence with respect to volumes from Rook 1's technically, environmentally and socially operation. All in all, updating the critical role NexGen is set to play in delivering the world this vital clean energy fuel supply.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050.

In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers.

Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet.

According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy.

The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize

U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now.

In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements.

In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits.

None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium.

All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE.

While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly.

Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply.

Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving. With the commission's hearing set for September 25 and February 2026, NexGen is preparing to transition from advanced development to construction and subsequent operations.

Our current cash balance stands at CAD 375 million, with funding to complete the 2025 site programs and initiate development for the first 12 months of post-approval construction. We maintain full strategic optionality with a strong cash position and active engagement with global debt providers, sovereign funds and utilities, amongst others, resulting in financing interest well in excess of the full funding requirements of the build. As we always have, we will optimize the vast number of financing alternatives available for maintaining our production flexibility and ultimately maximizing the value of each pound of uranium we produce and sell.

At PCE during the quarter, NexGen announced our best discovery phase assay today. We drill hole RK-25-232, returning an incredible 15 meters at 15.9% U3O8, including an exceptional peak of 0.5 meters at 68.8%. This is amongst the best exploration intercepts in the world with Arrow hosting the majority of the other top 10. Since discovery, 45 holes at PCE have been resected mineralization. Of these, 12 have produced the ultra-high-grade massive replacement mineralization of over 61,000 counts per

second. We've been bold with our spacing, in some cases, over 200 meters apart and are still intersecting mineralization consistently, demonstrating the continuity of mineralization and the overall strength of the system.

Drilling to date at PCE confirmed the start similarities to the Mighty Arrow deposit just 3.5 Ks away. It's suggesting the early signs of another Tier 1 assay. It really does speak to the vast discovery potential of potentially more deposits on the Rook 1 property in the future. We also recently announced the consolidation of our entire land package, including PCE with the purchase of Rio Tinto's 10% production carried interest. It held on 39 of our claims. NexGen has secured a right of first refusal mechanism over this package after a third party made a bonafide offer to acquire it from Rio. NexGen now holds 100% ownership of all its claims in the district. This speaks to the acceptance by not only NexGen but others of the tremendous value in the Southwestern Athabasca Basin portfolio, which dominates the known and prospective trends in the district, a district which is often referred to as the future of uranium mine.

In response, we have received regulatory approval to expand our exploration infrastructure, including a temporary air strip, road for dualway traffic and expanded accommodations to support a growing team on site. This program is currently underway and scheduled to be completed in Q1 2026.

Our elite standards on responsible development continues to guide every part of the business. In May, we released our fifth annual sustainability report aligned with Global Reporting Initiative and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure Standards, highlighting major advancement across environmental, social and governance metrics. Through our growing education and workforce development programs, over 500 participants have engaged in NexGen-led training initiatives these past 2 years across a wide range of skilled trades. These programs developed in partnership with regional institutions and indigenous communities are designed to build capacity and create meaningful career paths aligned with the project's long-term needs. Indigenous leaders have publicly recognized NexGen's unique and leading collaborative approach with all four of the indigenous nations in the local project area citing NexGen as a benchmark for meaningful indigenous engagement and shared prosperity.

Keeping an eye -- I advise to keep an eye out for a video on our website about Chantelle Herman, who is one of a group of talented local students who have become members of the NexGen team, pursuing highly technical careers at NexGen while still living in their community. Chantelle is one of these leaders in the community and Travis and I met back in 2015 at the National School Volleyball tournament and went on through our summer student program, followed by a scholarship and is now a second year geology student university whilst working as a field geology technician at Rook 1. This is one of many great outcomes from the Rook 1 project and is the foundation of delivering even greater generational advancement of the project as it goes into construction and operation.

NexGen is well advanced on procurement with long lead and critical path items already ordered and in several cases, staged and secured in our warehouse. This progress reflects NexGen's fully integrated execution strategy and proactive supply chain planning, ensuring we are ready to begin major construction immediately upon final regulatory approval. With the team, materials and partnerships in place, Group 1 is execution ready. As we enter the next phase, our focus is clear; conclude approvals, finalize funding and begin building the most important new uranium project in a generation in a manner fully consistent with how NexGen have delivered the best results today across every aspect of the organization. At NexGen, we're advancing with clarity and conviction. We're executing with deep respect for the environment, communities, Saskatchewan, Canada, the world and our shareholders. We are energized by the opportunity to lead the future of nuclear. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to delivering further progress in the second half of the year. Thank you, and we will now open the call to your questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

\[Operator Instructions\] And we will take our first question here coming from Katie Lachapelle with Canaccord.

Katie Lachapelle

Congrats on the new offtake. Similar to your previous agreements, you noted that it was a market-related contract. Two questions. Can you confirm if there's floors and ceilings in that new contract? And then as a follow-up, it appears that you're signing better terms relative to what some of your peer companies are announcing. Is that fair to say? And if so, what do you think is giving you that edge?

Leigh Robert Curyer

I can confirm that our contracts as a blend are very substantially market-related prices at the time of delivery. There's not one contract that fits all. Contracts are very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of either the producer or the emerging producer and also that of the particular circumstances of the utility. I would make a general comment that U.S. utilities and particularly the larger ones do prefer a surety around future pricing. And so what you'll see with those contracts is an embedded floor and ceiling. And where that is the case with NexGen, and I want to say that we have 4 contracts in place, which cover all aspects, floor and ceiling, full spot and then also no floor and an extremely high ceiling. They are, based on our knowledge of the market, very strong relatively. And I think that speaks to a number of things. I think it's an overall assessment by utilities with respect to the state of the current mine supply worldwide. We're seeing some of the historical projects that have been getting back into production, not meeting expectation. And then we're also seeing significant sovereign and technical risk impact some of the current producing centers. So what NexGen represents and also the other advanced developers in Denison, particularly in Canada, is we provide an alternative or a diversified supply of this key important fuel. And I think that then ultimately gets reflected in the pricing from what has occurred in the past to what is actually about to unfold in the future. So I know that's a bit of a long-winded answer, but we are only conveying what we're experiencing, and that is what is driving our contract book.

Katie Lachapelle

Awesome. Maybe just one quick follow-up. In the past, you've indicated, I think it was upwards of USD 1.6 billion in lending interest from banks and other credit providers. Is that number around the same? Or has that changed? And now that you've got a couple of these offtake contracts in hand, do you feel like you're getting closer to finalizing an agreement on the debt side?

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes. And I'll hand over to Travis to answer.

Travis G. McPherson

Yes. Thanks, Katie. And as Leigh indicated, yes, it is growing, I would say. There's more parties getting involved seemingly every week, frankly. I think that's on the back of, obviously, all those banks signing that agreement to support the funding of this growth initiative by all these international governments. Also the bank was -- funding of nuclear projects well in excess of that and offtakes, I would say, do help the lending process, but it also opens up potentially new avenues of lending with government as an example. So -- but to be clear, the offtake contracts are being done kind of on an isolated basis based on our acceptance of those terms and everything like there -- it's not like we're conceding on anything that we want long term. So yes, it's very positive, and we're really interested to fund the full project along the time lines that we've indicated in the past, which is end of the year, into Q1 of next year ahead of the approval process. Also debt is one of the alternatives at hand. As Leigh mentioned in the earlier part of the call, we do have a number. I think it should be unsurprising the quality of the asset and which offers, but we have quite a few options at hand to fund the full project.

Operator

And our next question will come from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.

Andrew D. Wong

So just maybe back on financing a little bit. With regard to that, as you're having more of these conversations with various partners and there's more and more interest, what's your sense on the most likely path here? Is having a strategic asset or sorry, a strategic partner, the most preferred path and then maybe that's supplemented by debt or equity? Can you maybe just provide a sense on that?

Travis G. McPherson

Yes. Thanks. Maybe I'll start...

Leigh Robert Curyer

Go ahead, Travis. Do you want to go?

Travis G. McPherson

Yes. I would say we don't have a preferred path at this stage, like we're keeping an open mind to all of the avenues at hand. They all come with -- well, first of all, they're all at various stages. I would say all of them are advanced, but obviously, various stages of how advanced they are. And so all of them are attractive in isolation or together. So I would say we're keeping a very open mind with respect to how this ultimately gets funded, although obviously, we are keeping our focus on our ability to be flexible with respect to production volumes and maintaining our leverage to future upside in prices. That's what I would say to that. And Leigh, obviously...

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes, exactly. Look, our principle is to finance it in a manner that optimizes the production and the return on every pound produced. And we're working both streams, both the equity stream, project equity, debt and also the potential of a prepayment on the future supply of a volume of pounds. Each one of them comes with their costs and benefits, but the overall principle that we will incorporate when we conclude the package is optimizing the exposure to future uranium prices. And whilst we can't be specific on the debt-to- equity percentage or whether it's project equity or not, that will be the guiding principle. And we will be most likely concluding that in the first half of 2026 at the -- subject to respectfully, the conclusion of the CNSC hearing process.

Andrew D. Wong

Okay. Great. Then just maybe on the project itself in terms of construction, given that the approval might be coming sometime in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about how the project team is shaping up right now? Can you highlight any construction expertise you've hired or if there are any notable additions recently?

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes, it's a good question, Andrew, one that we don't make a lot of noise about. But behind the scenes, there's a very well-planned human resource execution that is going on. We've been adding to the team consistently since 2017 in line with the stage of development. Look, there's no doubt we've appointed some people that are ready to go and start constructing this mine. And obviously, we've -- when we've seen a quality hire, we've hired them on board. And they're very -- they're busy. They're not sitting around doing nothing, that's for sure. But -- so I would say on balance, we're probably over employed, but it is going to pay extreme dividends once we have that approval and we're into the construction phase.

The benefit of a long permitting process is it gives you plenty of opportunity to plan, plan, review, plan again and review again and I can tell you the construction plan is down to a finite detail. We know exactly what we're building. It's technically a very simple mine in a mining sense. And we've attracted the best in the business on to the team. We have a combination of both direct employees and consultants, but the overall philosophy of NexGen is that we don't delegate any decision-making. We have a person on the team that takes responsibility for their respective field and that responsibility ultimately rests with Travis and myself and the Board. And so we are very much owner constructor and operator model.

Operator

And our next question will come from Ralph Profiti with Stifel.

Ralph M. Profiti

Leigh and Travis, I just want to delve in a little bit on these two offtake contracts being held to a 5-year term. Was there appetite on the part of the counterparties to move those contracts out to a further tenure? And is what's holding back sort of movement on the floors and the ceilings? Or is this becoming the industry standard? Or I'm just wondering if there's other factors at play, specifically with regards to the tenure?

Leigh Robert Curyer

We -- the contracts are very different dependent on the actual asset and the utility. There's not one contract that suits all. And that is also reflective of the utilities specific requirements. Utilities have a range of contracts with a range of suppliers and some are short term and some are long term. I would class ours as medium term in terms of length. And we are just at the beginning, we're at 3% of our total defined resources at Arrow. And we all know that the Arrow deposit is much larger and given its inferred resource, which will convert to indicated with subsequently closer space drilling.

I would say our philosophy is -- at the moment, we're negotiating a variety of between 3-year, 5-year and 10-year contracts. And it is really dependent on the specific circumstances of the utility. And those characteristics differ from one region to the next worldwide, like the U.S. utilities have a different preference to the Asian utilities who have a different preference to the European utilities. So I just want to make the point that there's not one contract in this market that fits all. It is very specific to the utility and very specific to the producer. What we offer is obviously a high level of confidence in volume given the technical simplicity of our project. And that is resonating strongly with the utility customers.

Ralph M. Profiti

That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And Leigh, you mentioned the Bill C5 a couple of times in your preprepared comments. And now that we're 6 months from that second CNSC hearing, it does sound like there's iterations going on with detailed engineering. I'm just wondering, has there been any scope changes with regards to plant, equipment or components in the design that are directly being driven by Bill C5. And the reason I'm asking is just to kind of think about scope changes in the early preconstruction phase of the project.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes. Interesting question, but the answer is no. Our scope, there's been absolutely no scope changes whatsoever, full stop, and we wouldn't be contemplating scope changes as a result of Bill C5. Our approach since even prior to discovery has been to deliver an environmentally elite approach along with a socially elite approach. And we have done that. And in every respect, we have exceeded the requirements of the legislation from a technical and environmental perspective. And also from a social perspective, it's well documented that we've been incredibly proactive in engaging and consulting with indigenous communities and implemented programs where there is incredibly strong collaboration between NexGen and the communities. And that actually even extends beyond those that are defined as impacted. So I think Bill C5 is a reflection of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government recognizing that there are elements of duplication to permit a resources project, not just specific to uranium, but major energy and national infrastructure projects. And I absolutely applaud them for recognizing that and introducing legislation that aims to make the whole process more efficient whilst maintaining incredibly high environmental and social standards that Canada leads the world in. So that's why we are in Canada. That absolutely is aligned with our values as an organization, and we are very proud to deliver this project to Canada in line with the very high environmental and social standards that Canadians expect.

Operator

And our next question will come from George Ross with Argonaut.

Unidentified Analyst

It's Sam. Just in regards to the production carried interest, when is the market going to be informed a little bit more on the cost, et cetera, attached to that?

Leigh Robert Curyer

Well, it's confidential as per the agreement of the clause that triggered it. And so, yes, we are unable to disclose what it means or what the cost was specifically in relation to that acquisition. I will say we are very pleased to have acquired it. We had approached Rio Tinto on it. And then, yes, bonafiding bid was received by an external party, which we do not even know the identity of. And so we triggered our right of first refusal. And whoever that party was, thank you for expediting the process.

Unidentified Analyst

Fair enough. Okay. And just in regards to the Patterson trend, any plans to sort of test along strike at this point, Leigh? Or it's very much just going to be focused on sort of defining the higher grades there at PCE?

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes. Our initial focus is to define and extend what we have at PCE. But look, we also have seen the results at Patterson, which is basically an extension of the trend, the Patterson Corridor East trend of our property, and they've hit mineralization as well. And what that says is that the whole conductor is very highly prospective for additional mineralization. As I speak, we've probably explored less than 1% of that actual Patterson Corridor East conductor trend. Similarly, with Arrow, we've explored less than 10% of that particular conductor corridor. And as everyone knows, you've got RRR that's along the Patterson Corridor conductor of our project. So the area is extremely well mineralized, and we are on the cusp or just at the very, very beginning of truly defining its true extent. We have 8 conductor corridors going through the Rook 1 project alone. There's no doubt there's been a significant mineralizing event in the region. And yes, we've put in an exploration camp to facilitate extensive exploration of that region of which we host 320,000 hectares. So it's incredibly exciting. It really is a geological phenom. And we are -- yes, there's a lot of drilling to be done before we can truly hold our hand on our hearts and say, you know what, this is the extent of it.

Operator

And our next question will come from \[ Fred Pollard, \] a private investor.

Unidentified Analyst

You mentioned Rook 1 is execution ready, and you've been held back, in my view, for some time now awaiting the federal approval process. You mentioned C5, and I have a couple of questions along that theme. So has C5 triggered some conversations with the government on advancing mine approval? And secondly, might there be some movement on the government schedule that you also mentioned earlier in the call? And I ask that because of the principles of fast tracking that are associated with Bill C5.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Thank you for the question. And it's a very topical question. Look, I would say that the introduction of Bill C5 from Prime Minister Carney is absolute recognition that there are some efficiencies that can be gained at the federal level, particularly after provincial approval and the indigenous community approval in the region of a specific project. And he's been very, very clear about that. And as a consequence, he's also going to resource a new project's office to help fast track the federal process. I absolutely applaud Prime Minister Carney and his ministers for that endeavor. I think in reality, the NexGen project is so advanced in the process that these initiatives are going to really benefit other projects that come after NexGen. And so we are resource industry advocates clearly. And we're really excited about that because like NexGen isn't going to fill the gap on its own. The world needs -- with respect to uranium, the world needs 2 to 3 Arrows and they need them now. So I think that's excellent news for every other advanced developer out there looking to get into construction. So specifically to our project, I think the benefit is most likely for other projects behind us, but I absolutely applaud the recognition and the importance that the federal government is placing on the expedition of major projects.

Operator

\[Operator Instructions\] Our next question will come from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

Brian MacArthur

If I can just go back to the contracts, there's been a lot of talk about floors and ceilings. But can you confirm or deny, I guess, whether there are any volume options in those contracts? It sounds like there isn't the way you're talking about how much is committed, but I'm just trying to figure out how that part of the equation is working in all these contracts.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes, Brian, there's no volume discretion in the contracts by the utility or us as the supplier. I'd make -- and that's very clear. I'd make a general statement that the form and structure and pricing of the contracts are changing from what has been done in the past. The environment is changing. And the contracts which we are doing are different and have got different elements to what has been done in the past. And I think you're just going to see that naturally evolve over time as the scarcity and the risk, be it sovereign or technically around supply increases. And so yes, my overall comment is the environment is changing. There's no doubt about it. And what we are conveying to the market is what we are experiencing, and it's different for all companies. And as I said, it's very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of your supply and also very specific to the particular utilities preferences, and they differ between the U.S., Asia and Europe.

Brian MacArthur

Great. That's very clear. Second thing, can I just confirm there's been a couple of comments about the financing and timing, whether it's year-end or H1 next year and then comments around the CNSC approval. Could you have financing in place before the CNSC approval? And would that be subject to CNSC approval? Or are they sort of dependent on each other? Any comments on that? Just to clarify, I think, would be helpful.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes. They're obviously related. And we -- look, if we were approved today, we would have concluded the financing. We've been well prepared for this for many years. But we can't really trigger the financing until we have approval to that extent. So as time -- as that final approval timetable unfolds, so will the financing. And terms or optionality may be better in the future given the way this environment is changing. And so we are just keeping our exposure to that in place. But I can assure you, we will conclude financing in short order post approval.

Brian MacArthur

There are just different time horizons talked about. So I was just trying to clarify that. I appreciate it.

Operator

And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leigh Curyer for any closing remarks.

Leigh Robert Curyer

Yes. Thank you all for listening and joining the Q2 call. Thank you for your questions. We certainly appreciate them and everyone's interest in this incredible project. And Q3 is going to be an incredible quarter ahead of us with everything that we're working on and the conclusion through the end of the year, not just what's happening at NexGen, but driven by what is happening in a very rapidly changing market environment. And we appreciate your interest in our project, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on the milestones that we have articulated.

Operator

This brings to close today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day.

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NexGen Energy Second Quarter of 2025 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. \[Operator Instructions\] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer and Director with NexGen Energy Limited. Please go ahead, sir.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Thank you, Joseph. Good morning, and thank you for joining NexGen's Q2 2025 Financial Results and Investor Conference Call. My name is Leigh Curyer, and I am Chief Executive Officer. Today, I'm joined by Travis McPherson, Chief Commercial Officer; and Benjamin Salter, Chief Financial Officer.

On today's call, I'll discuss our exciting company advancements, including Rook 1 Project Readiness, Patterson Corridor East results, which strongly validate another significant mineral body is unfolding 3.5 kilometers to the east alongside Arrow. Further, the PCE results clearly suggest a very significant uranium mineralizing event has occurred in the Southwest region of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, on an unprecedented well scale and that we are really only at the beginning of defining its true extent. Further, the exciting developments in the uranium market over the quarter, including yesterday's announcement of NexGen doubling the volume in our offtake book, incorporating our key focus of market-related pricing mechanisms, ensuring NexGen Energy deliver industry- leading leverage to future prices whilst providing utilities with confidence with respect to volumes from Rook 1's technically, environmentally and socially operation. All in all, updating the critical role NexGen is set to play in delivering the world this vital clean energy fuel supply.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050.

In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers.

Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet.

According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy.

The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize

U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now.

In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements.

In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits.

None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium.

All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE.

While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly.

Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply.

Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving. With the commission's hearing set for September 25 and February 2026, NexGen is preparing to transition from advanced development to construction and subsequent operations.

Our current cash balance stands at CAD 375 million, with funding to complete the 2025 site programs and initiate development for the first 12 months of post-approval construction. We maintain full strategic optionality with a strong cash position and active engagement with global debt providers, sovereign funds and utilities, amongst others, resulting in financing interest well in excess of the full funding requirements of the build. As we always have, we will optimize the vast number of financing alternatives available for maintaining our production flexibility and ultimately maximizing the value of each pound of uranium we produce and sell.

At PCE during the quarter, NexGen announced our best discovery phase assay today. We drill hole RK-25-232, returning an incredible 15 meters at 15.9% U3O8, including an exceptional peak of 0.5 meters at 68.8%. This is amongst the best exploration intercepts in the world with Arrow hosting the majority of the other top 10. Since discovery, 45 holes at PCE have been resected mineralization. Of these, 12 have produced the ultra-high-grade massive replacement mineralization of over 61,000 counts per

second. We've been bold with our spacing, in some cases, over 200 meters apart and are still intersecting mineralization consistently, demonstrating the continuity of mineralization and the overall strength of the system.

Drilling to date at PCE confirmed the start similarities to the Mighty Arrow deposit just 3.5 Ks away. It's suggesting the early signs of another Tier 1 assay. It really does speak to the vast discovery potential of potentially more deposits on the Rook 1 property in the future. We also recently announced the consolidation of our entire land package, including PCE with the purchase of Rio Tinto's 10% production carried interest. It held on 39 of our claims. NexGen has secured a right of first refusal mechanism over this package after a third party made a bonafide offer to acquire it from Rio. NexGen now holds 100% ownership of all its claims in the district. This speaks to the acceptance by not only NexGen but others of the tremendous value in the Southwestern Athabasca Basin portfolio, which dominates the known and prospective trends in the district, a district which is often referred to as the future of uranium mine.

In response, we have received regulatory approval to expand our exploration infrastructure, including a temporary air strip, road for dualway traffic and expanded accommodations to support a growing team on site. This program is currently underway and scheduled to be completed in Q1 2026.

Our elite standards on responsible development continues to guide every part of the business. In May, we released our fifth annual sustainability report aligned with Global Reporting Initiative and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure Standards, highlighting major advancement across environmental, social and governance metrics. Through our growing education and workforce development programs, over 500 participants have engaged in NexGen-led training initiatives these past 2 years across a wide range of skilled trades. These programs developed in partnership with regional institutions and indigenous communities are designed to build capacity and create meaningful career paths aligned with the project's long-term needs. Indigenous leaders have publicly recognized NexGen's unique and leading collaborative approach with all four of the indigenous nations in the local project area citing NexGen as a benchmark for meaningful indigenous engagement and shared prosperity.

Keeping an eye -- I advise to keep an eye out for a video on our website about Chantelle Herman, who is one of a group of talented local students who have become members of the NexGen team, pursuing highly technical careers at NexGen while still living in their community. Chantelle is one of these leaders in the community and Travis and I met back in 2015 at the National School Volleyball tournament and went on through our summer student program, followed by a scholarship and is now a second year geology student university whilst working as a field geology technician at Rook 1. This is one of many great outcomes from the Rook 1 project and is the foundation of delivering even greater generational advancement of the project as it goes into construction and operation.

NexGen is well advanced on procurement with long lead and critical path items already ordered and in several cases, staged and secured in our warehouse. This progress reflects NexGen's fully integrated execution strategy and proactive supply chain planning, ensuring we are ready to begin major construction immediately upon final regulatory approval. With the team, materials and partnerships in place, Group 1 is execution ready. As we enter the next phase, our focus is clear; conclude approvals, finalize funding and begin building the most important new uranium project in a generation in a manner fully consistent with how NexGen have delivered the best results today across every aspect of the organization. At NexGen, we're advancing with clarity and conviction. We're executing with deep respect for the environment, communities, Saskatchewan, Canada, the world and our shareholders. We are energized by the opportunity to lead the future of nuclear. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to delivering further progress in the second half of the year. Thank you, and we will now open the call to your questions.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] And we will take our first question here coming from Katie Lachapelle with Canaccord.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Congrats on the new offtake. Similar to your previous agreements, you noted that it was a market-related contract. Two questions. Can you confirm if there's floors and ceilings in that new contract? And then as a follow-up, it appears that you're signing better terms relative to what some of your peer companies are announcing. Is that fair to say? And if so, what do you think is giving you that edge?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

I can confirm that our contracts as a blend are very substantially market-related prices at the time of delivery. There's not one contract that fits all. Contracts are very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of either the producer or the emerging producer and also that of the particular circumstances of the utility. I would make a general comment that U.S. utilities and particularly the larger ones do prefer a surety around future pricing. And so what you'll see with those contracts is an embedded floor and ceiling. And where that is the case with NexGen, and I want to say that we have 4 contracts in place, which cover all aspects, floor and ceiling, full spot and then also no floor and an extremely high ceiling. They are, based on our knowledge of the market, very strong relatively. And I think that speaks to a number of things. I think it's an overall assessment by utilities with respect to the state of the current mine supply worldwide. We're seeing some of the historical projects that have been getting back into production, not meeting expectation. And then we're also seeing significant sovereign and technical risk impact some of the current producing centers. So what NexGen represents and also the other advanced developers in Denison, particularly in Canada, is we provide an alternative or a diversified supply of this key important fuel. And I think that then ultimately gets reflected in the pricing from what has occurred in the past to what is actually about to unfold in the future. So I know that's a bit of a long-winded answer, but we are only conveying what we're experiencing, and that is what is driving our contract book.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Awesome. Maybe just one quick follow-up. In the past, you've indicated, I think it was upwards of USD 1.6 billion in lending interest from banks and other credit providers. Is that number around the same? Or has that changed? And now that you've got a couple of these offtake contracts in hand, do you feel like you're getting closer to finalizing an agreement on the debt side?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. And I'll hand over to Travis to answer.

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks, Katie. And as Leigh indicated, yes, it is growing, I would say. There's more parties getting involved seemingly every week, frankly. I think that's on the back of, obviously, all those banks signing that agreement to support the funding of this growth initiative by all these international governments. Also the bank was -- funding of nuclear projects well in excess of that and offtakes, I would say, do help the lending process, but it also opens up potentially new avenues of lending with government as an example. So -- but to be clear, the offtake contracts are being done kind of on an isolated basis based on our acceptance of those terms and everything like there -- it's not like we're conceding on anything that we want long term. So yes, it's very positive, and we're really interested to fund the full project along the time lines that we've indicated in the past, which is end of the year, into Q1 of next year ahead of the approval process. Also debt is one of the alternatives at hand. As Leigh mentioned in the earlier part of the call, we do have a number. I think it should be unsurprising the quality of the asset and which offers, but we have quite a few options at hand to fund the full project.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.

**Andrew D. Wong**

So just maybe back on financing a little bit. With regard to that, as you're having more of these conversations with various partners and there's more and more interest, what's your sense on the most likely path here? Is having a strategic asset or sorry, a strategic partner, the most preferred path and then maybe that's supplemented by debt or equity? Can you maybe just provide a sense on that?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks. Maybe I'll start...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Go ahead, Travis. Do you want to go?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. I would say we don't have a preferred path at this stage, like we're keeping an open mind to all of the avenues at hand. They all come with -- well, first of all, they're all at various stages. I would say all of them are advanced, but obviously, various stages of how advanced they are. And so all of them are attractive in isolation or together. So I would say we're keeping a very open mind with respect to how this ultimately gets funded, although obviously, we are keeping our focus on our ability to be flexible with respect to production volumes and maintaining our leverage to future upside in prices. That's what I would say to that. And Leigh, obviously...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, exactly. Look, our principle is to finance it in a manner that optimizes the production and the return on every pound produced. And we're working both streams, both the equity stream, project equity, debt and also the potential of a prepayment on the future supply of a volume of pounds. Each one of them comes with their costs and benefits, but the overall principle that we will incorporate when we conclude the package is optimizing the exposure to future uranium prices. And whilst we can't be specific on the debt-to- equity percentage or whether it's project equity or not, that will be the guiding principle. And we will be most likely concluding that in the first half of 2026 at the -- subject to respectfully, the conclusion of the CNSC hearing process.

**Andrew D. Wong**

Okay. Great. Then just maybe on the project itself in terms of construction, given that the approval might be coming sometime in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about how the project team is shaping up right now? Can you highlight any construction expertise you've hired or if there are any notable additions recently?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, it's a good question, Andrew, one that we don't make a lot of noise about. But behind the scenes, there's a very well-planned human resource execution that is going on. We've been adding to the team consistently since 2017 in line with the stage of development. Look, there's no doubt we've appointed some people that are ready to go and start constructing this mine. And obviously, we've -- when we've seen a quality hire, we've hired them on board. And they're very -- they're busy. They're not sitting around doing nothing, that's for sure. But -- so I would say on balance, we're probably over employed, but it is going to pay extreme dividends once we have that approval and we're into the construction phase.

The benefit of a long permitting process is it gives you plenty of opportunity to plan, plan, review, plan again and review again and I can tell you the construction plan is down to a finite detail. We know exactly what we're building. It's technically a very simple mine in a mining sense. And we've attracted the best in the business on to the team. We have a combination of both direct employees and consultants, but the overall philosophy of NexGen is that we don't delegate any decision-making. We have a person on the team that takes responsibility for their respective field and that responsibility ultimately rests with Travis and myself and the Board. And so we are very much owner constructor and operator model.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Ralph Profiti with Stifel.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

Leigh and Travis, I just want to delve in a little bit on these two offtake contracts being held to a 5-year term. Was there appetite on the part of the counterparties to move those contracts out to a further tenure? And is what's holding back sort of movement on the floors and the ceilings? Or is this becoming the industry standard? Or I'm just wondering if there's other factors at play, specifically with regards to the tenure?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

We -- the contracts are very different dependent on the actual asset and the utility. There's not one contract that suits all. And that is also reflective of the utilities specific requirements. Utilities have a range of contracts with a range of suppliers and some are short term and some are long term. I would class ours as medium term in terms of length. And we are just at the beginning, we're at 3% of our total defined resources at Arrow. And we all know that the Arrow deposit is much larger and given its inferred resource, which will convert to indicated with subsequently closer space drilling.

I would say our philosophy is -- at the moment, we're negotiating a variety of between 3-year, 5-year and 10-year contracts. And it is really dependent on the specific circumstances of the utility. And those characteristics differ from one region to the next worldwide, like the U.S. utilities have a different preference to the Asian utilities who have a different preference to the European utilities. So I just want to make the point that there's not one contract in this market that fits all. It is very specific to the utility and very specific to the producer. What we offer is obviously a high level of confidence in volume given the technical simplicity of our project. And that is resonating strongly with the utility customers.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And Leigh, you mentioned the Bill C5 a couple of times in your preprepared comments. And now that we're 6 months from that second CNSC hearing, it does sound like there's iterations going on with detailed engineering. I'm just wondering, has there been any scope changes with regards to plant, equipment or components in the design that are directly being driven by Bill C5. And the reason I'm asking is just to kind of think about scope changes in the early preconstruction phase of the project.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Interesting question, but the answer is no. Our scope, there's been absolutely no scope changes whatsoever, full stop, and we wouldn't be contemplating scope changes as a result of Bill C5. Our approach since even prior to discovery has been to deliver an environmentally elite approach along with a socially elite approach. And we have done that. And in every respect, we have exceeded the requirements of the legislation from a technical and environmental perspective. And also from a social perspective, it's well documented that we've been incredibly proactive in engaging and consulting with indigenous communities and implemented programs where there is incredibly strong collaboration between NexGen and the communities. And that actually even extends beyond those that are defined as impacted. So I think Bill C5 is a reflection of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government recognizing that there are elements of duplication to permit a resources project, not just specific to uranium, but major energy and national infrastructure projects. And I absolutely applaud them for recognizing that and introducing legislation that aims to make the whole process more efficient whilst maintaining incredibly high environmental and social standards that Canada leads the world in. So that's why we are in Canada. That absolutely is aligned with our values as an organization, and we are very proud to deliver this project to Canada in line with the very high environmental and social standards that Canadians expect.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from George Ross with Argonaut.

**Unidentified Analyst**

It's Sam. Just in regards to the production carried interest, when is the market going to be informed a little bit more on the cost, et cetera, attached to that?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Well, it's confidential as per the agreement of the clause that triggered it. And so, yes, we are unable to disclose what it means or what the cost was specifically in relation to that acquisition. I will say we are very pleased to have acquired it. We had approached Rio Tinto on it. And then, yes, bonafiding bid was received by an external party, which we do not even know the identity of. And so we triggered our right of first refusal. And whoever that party was, thank you for expediting the process.

**Unidentified Analyst**

Fair enough. Okay. And just in regards to the Patterson trend, any plans to sort of test along strike at this point, Leigh? Or it's very much just going to be focused on sort of defining the higher grades there at PCE?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Our initial focus is to define and extend what we have at PCE. But look, we also have seen the results at Patterson, which is basically an extension of the trend, the Patterson Corridor East trend of our property, and they've hit mineralization as well. And what that says is that the whole conductor is very highly prospective for additional mineralization. As I speak, we've probably explored less than 1% of that actual Patterson Corridor East conductor trend. Similarly, with Arrow, we've explored less than 10% of that particular conductor corridor. And as everyone knows, you've got RRR that's along the Patterson Corridor conductor of our project. So the area is extremely well mineralized, and we are on the cusp or just at the very, very beginning of truly defining its true extent. We have 8 conductor corridors going through the Rook 1 project alone. There's no doubt there's been a significant mineralizing event in the region. And yes, we've put in an exploration camp to facilitate extensive exploration of that region of which we host 320,000 hectares. So it's incredibly exciting. It really is a geological phenom. And we are -- yes, there's a lot of drilling to be done before we can truly hold our hand on our hearts and say, you know what, this is the extent of it.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from \[ Fred Pollard, \] a private investor.

**Unidentified Analyst**

You mentioned Rook 1 is execution ready, and you've been held back, in my view, for some time now awaiting the federal approval process. You mentioned C5, and I have a couple of questions along that theme. So has C5 triggered some conversations with the government on advancing mine approval? And secondly, might there be some movement on the government schedule that you also mentioned earlier in the call? And I ask that because of the principles of fast tracking that are associated with Bill C5.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Thank you for the question. And it's a very topical question. Look, I would say that the introduction of Bill C5 from Prime Minister Carney is absolute recognition that there are some efficiencies that can be gained at the federal level, particularly after provincial approval and the indigenous community approval in the region of a specific project. And he's been very, very clear about that. And as a consequence, he's also going to resource a new project's office to help fast track the federal process. I absolutely applaud Prime Minister Carney and his ministers for that endeavor. I think in reality, the NexGen project is so advanced in the process that these initiatives are going to really benefit other projects that come after NexGen. And so we are resource industry advocates clearly. And we're really excited about that because like NexGen isn't going to fill the gap on its own. The world needs -- with respect to uranium, the world needs 2 to 3 Arrows and they need them now. So I think that's excellent news for every other advanced developer out there looking to get into construction. So specifically to our project, I think the benefit is most likely for other projects behind us, but I absolutely applaud the recognition and the importance that the federal government is placing on the expedition of major projects.

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] Our next question will come from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

**Brian MacArthur**

If I can just go back to the contracts, there's been a lot of talk about floors and ceilings. But can you confirm or deny, I guess, whether there are any volume options in those contracts? It sounds like there isn't the way you're talking about how much is committed, but I'm just trying to figure out how that part of the equation is working in all these contracts.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, Brian, there's no volume discretion in the contracts by the utility or us as the supplier. I'd make -- and that's very clear. I'd make a general statement that the form and structure and pricing of the contracts are changing from what has been done in the past. The environment is changing. And the contracts which we are doing are different and have got different elements to what has been done in the past. And I think you're just going to see that naturally evolve over time as the scarcity and the risk, be it sovereign or technically around supply increases. And so yes, my overall comment is the environment is changing. There's no doubt about it. And what we are conveying to the market is what we are experiencing, and it's different for all companies. And as I said, it's very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of your supply and also very specific to the particular utilities preferences, and they differ between the U.S., Asia and Europe.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. That's very clear. Second thing, can I just confirm there's been a couple of comments about the financing and timing, whether it's year-end or H1 next year and then comments around the CNSC approval. Could you have financing in place before the CNSC approval? And would that be subject to CNSC approval? Or are they sort of dependent on each other? Any comments on that? Just to clarify, I think, would be helpful.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. They're obviously related. And we -- look, if we were approved today, we would have concluded the financing. We've been well prepared for this for many years. But we can't really trigger the financing until we have approval to that extent. So as time -- as that final approval timetable unfolds, so will the financing. And terms or optionality may be better in the future given the way this environment is changing. And so we are just keeping our exposure to that in place. But I can assure you, we will conclude financing in short order post approval.

**Brian MacArthur**

There are just different time horizons talked about. So I was just trying to clarify that. I appreciate it.

**Operator**

And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leigh Curyer for any closing remarks.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Thank you all for listening and joining the Q2 call. Thank you for your questions. We certainly appreciate them and everyone's interest in this incredible project. And Q3 is going to be an incredible quarter ahead of us with everything that we're working on and the conclusion through the end of the year, not just what's happening at NexGen, but driven by what is happening in a very rapidly changing market environment. And we appreciate your interest in our project, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on the milestones that we have articulated.

What you should know.",OveratedUsername,/r/trakstocks/comments/m2turg/palantir_pltr_the_worlds_next_most_important/,https://www.reddit.com/r/trakstocks/comments/m2turg/palantir_pltr_the_worlds_next_most_important/,288,66,1615479262.0,"TLDR in bold.

With the huge amounts of **innovation** going on companies are racing so they're not left behind. **That's where Palantir comes in**.

**A Silicon Valley product company that saves other company lots of money and makes them more efficient**. Their software is a dashboard spotting patterns deep within company data. Finding the needle in several disparate haystacks. PLTR devises models so companies can predict the effects of changes they make *before* they make them.

PLTR are believed to have assisted in Osama Bin Laden capture.

**Assist in several military missions .**

**It's harder to get an internship at Palantir than it is at Google** and this branding helps them attract the best talent.

**Often known to use the ""drug dealer tactic""** where they're so confident in their product they give you a little for virtually nothing, and you come back for more.

**Their Big Goal is to become default software platform across every imaginable industry**

# LEADERSHIP

&amp;#x200B;

[Alex Karp \(Left\) Peter Thiel \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/owl52a9p7fm61.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69852414448b05138eb1470fd21cf27c6696eab5)

* **Bull**: Co-founder and Chairman **Peter Thiel** (also co-founder of Paypal and first outside investor of FB) is a Stanford Law Grad as is CEO **Alex Karp**. Thiel wrote a highly revered book ""*Zero to One*"" . He outlines how to have success as a start-up and from what I've read.  He believes ""[Competition is for Losers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fx5Q8xGU8k&amp;t=1552s)"" Palantir is ticking off the boxes. Synopsis [here](https://youtu.be/Hd9pHZC7Sak) .

&amp;#x200B;

* **Bear:** They *themselve*s are not Computer Science / Software guys. Usually ideal for CEO do have in-depth knowledge of the field their product occupies. E.g Elon having education in Physics, Economics + Rocket Science Enthusiast. Microsoft CEO (electrical engineering *and* masters in Computer Science).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Biggest Palantir threat is existing customers developing in-house solutions""-Alex Karp.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Bull**: But the longer it takes customers to build their own solutions, the more ""smart"" Palantir's AI becomes. The delta between savings from Palantir and savings from developing in-house solutions grow wider and wider. **Keeping the customer in Palantir ecosystem.**

&amp;#x200B;

* There is a law that US government must first use 3rd-Party solutions and only if they don't work only then can they spend money and time on in-house solution development.

&gt;**Army violated 1994 FASA law -- the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act** \-- *""by not conducting the market research needed to determine if commercially available items could meet its needs with or without modification"". -DefenseNews.com*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Peter Thiel and CEO Alex Karp the Stanford Law grads**.

PLTR **sued the US-military** to high heaven and WON twice (again when military appealed). They've monopolised there and got CIA, FBI, Air Force, Marines and many many more departments.

* **Harder to be accepted into Palantir than it is in Google.** The interview process is intense, few get in. It's become somewhat impressive to have worked at Palantir. Somewhat of a status symbol.
* **Bear**: Their talent are paid on average less overall than some of the bigger tech companies. Larger workload per employee  ( typical of a smaller company) .
* **Bear :** They the multi-class structure of the common stock, concentrate voting power with certain stockholders, in particular, Founders and their affiliates. i.e they could sell all their shares and still have enormous voting power.

# Palantir lack of profitability argument is poor and short-sited. Tesla, Amazon were both unprofitable for nearly 20 years.

Yet they are arguably 2 of the most successful companies in the world with growing market share. People still doubt Tesla today even with all the proof of execution trying to push that it's overvalued.

Edit: Disclaimer: I am long on Palantir and hoping to DCA building my position over the next few *year*s.

# PROFITABILITY

* Palantir offered huge stock based compensation (SBC) to their staff causing the apparent non-profitability.  **SBC have been used by Google and Amazon in the early days to encourage staff to stay and grow with the company.** SBC is possibly a sign of conviction by execs that Palantir is going to grow in the future.
* Initially they incur most of the costs when acquiring companies , Palantir are that confident  that they take on the initial risk themselves. They are getting their money back increasingly [quicker](https://youtu.be/I_evytMozbI?t=233).
* **Bear:** Some believe the **SBC numbers don't add up. SBC should not be high as it was** . Dilutes the shares. **SBC may suggest PLTR struggles for cash.**

&amp;#x200B;

If you want profitability i.e. more certainty, growth investing isn't for you and you'll make pitifully small returns. **Once consistent profitability is priced-in, the share price will reflect this.  You may be paying 3x the price we paid to get the same number of shares.** Dollar cost averaging is your friend. Build your position as you see more proof of execution and you build your conviction.

# GOVERNMENT WORK ""Too Political

*Gotham--&gt; Government ,*

* **BULL** **:** Palantir successfully monopolised a **previously undisrupted niche**. They **have survived during republican AND democrat cycles**. Even though the co-founders have very polar opposite political views: Karp (Liberal) and Thiel (Conservative) . A LOT of PLTR early costs were lobbying and getting government (gvt.) on board, developing the software. Garnering talented employees. Even in the beginning both CIA and FBI wouldnt budge.

&gt;""We convinced the CIA that the FBI were already in and convinced FBI that CIA was already in. This was very clever as neither group wanted to be behind the other."" - Peter Thiel

&amp;#x200B;

* **Government bodies are notoriously adverse to change.** They spend huge money when economy is down (unlike commercial businesses). Palantir allows GVT to simulate the effects of a decision and act accordingly. Reducing the likelihood of costly mistakes financially and reputation-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Virtually*** **pandemic-proof and in future recession-proof** (some contracts are paid years in advance). They have proven to be a necessity in all economic and political seasons.  Which a start-up would find VERY hard to do. Giving PLTR a **wide moat**.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Charged UK NHS £1 to trial their system, this was later renewed for £1,000,000.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Helped UK rollout vaccines with military precision](https://preview.redd.it/smwxpraz7fm61.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4984927041847266a85beaefc6f3c8b5227951b6)

* **Became a £23,000,000 ($32M) 2-year contract**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I*n December, Palantir’s contract with NHS England, for use of its Foundry software and engineers – which after its* ***first £1 trial period*** *in March had been* ***extended at £250,000 a month for six months*** *– became a fully fledged two-year deal to provide the NHS with “data management platform services” at a cost of £23.5m. - The Bureau Investigates*

* Developed Appollo- Implementation process decreased five-fold from 2019 to 2020. In some cases, customer systems set up within hours.
* **Golden goose**. AI-learning from government contracts (ie data set extending far earlier than almost every current commercial business) will ever have access to giving them a HUGE advantage over other commercial companies.

&amp;#x200B;

[You can see by the number of dots that PLTR operate at levels with low competition and high barrier to entry](https://preview.redd.it/26dvpsec7fm61.png?width=1192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a787a031229c166717a7f077195cf94dfb5a011)

* To be the only/main 3rd-party company with **Level 6 DoD SAAS** **for classified secret National Security** data analysis. Currently Level 5 with which PLTR are believed to have assisted in Osama Bin Laden capture, uncovered Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme, Detected Chines Spyware on Dali Lama’s computer (for perspective Snow and Google are level 2 -Public).
* **Google and most of Silicon valley data companies have expressed disdain for government** **involvement with software companies so are** ***unlikely*** **to ever try and compete with that Palantir** on that front [article here](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/futuresource/tech-revolt-why-are-silicon-valley-employees-fighting-government-contracts/).

&gt; *A number of major tech companies—including* [*Amazon*](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-workers-demand-jeff-bezos-cancel-face-recognitio-1827037509)*,* [*Google*](https://gizmodo.com/thousands-of-google-employees-protest-companys-involvem-1824988565)*, and* [*Salesforce*](http://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-employees-protest-work-customs-border-protection-agency-2018-6)*—have experienced employee backlash against government-contracting. Employees have signed petitions, spoken out, and even resigned in protest of such contracts*.- Atlantic Council

&amp;#x200B;

* BEAR:  If anything went wrong and they lose their government contracts, it could cause **irreversible damage** to Palantir's reputation. In an *extreme* case Palantir could be sued by the US government and drawn into a long and expensive court battle where the stock price would plummet. 
* **Easy Target fear mongering by press**: A lot of companies have execs and employees doing dodgy deals . They often complain about privacy breaches when they are caught out and run to media. Employees without proper documentation fearful of deportation also add fuel to the fire.
* **Secretive and Cryptic**. Government work has caused PLTR to be even more polarising to the masses. Involvement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) . Worried about their proximity to the government. PLTR initially funded by In-Q-Tel - CIA links. People fearful of the level of access  Palantir has to their private data , part of the reason UK are planning to sue.
* **Few fully understand exactly how Gotham works** **and what makes it** ***better*** than the competition. Since this may cause a threat to national security. May cause us to trade flat for many years as easy for institutions and news to spread rumours.
* **There may be a decline in the U.S. and other government budgets**, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, or delays in contracts awards;
* **Customer contracts are permitted to be terminated any time -** PLTR may not receive full funds
* **Government contracts have to be renewed every year -** unlike commercial clients where deals can be multi-year.
* May be **subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws** and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and security, technology protection etc.
* **A limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of  revenue**;

Palantir are growing and expanding into the commercial sector after already dominating the Government sector.

    (This is an over-simplification) 

&gt;We are *not* in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data — data that they already have. - 10K Annual Report

**Palantir's Foundry has a use case for every industry imaginable**.

**PLTR software brings government-grade security to industry**

**Currently used across  40 industries and 150 countries**. Total Adressible Market (TAM) almost infinite and possibly depends on how pro-active PLTR are in building contracts and improving public perception.

PLTR are demonstrating Foundry April 14th. Hopefully more people with more knowledge in this tech field will give an insight and reveal how it's used from which we can extrapolate how it's better than competition. **Perhaps Foundry will help ICE vehicles transition to EV's faster and both disruptors and disruptees alike in other industries Robotics, Energy Storage etc.**

**Because once your competitor is using the software and seeing great results, you are almost forced to use it too in attempts to close the gap.** Adoption increases possibly in an S-curve manner.

Personally I would love to see it used to *greatly* streamline the court-system (initially adopted by law firms). It could give everyone involved a far more balanced and holistic overview of cases in half the time and could greatly aid pro-bono cases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mock-up of case review example](https://preview.redd.it/t5tzp5jqpfm61.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dd852dfe902b2a1205486d7f1bd152796376d11)

Local councils (UK)  states (US) could use it to streamline everything from scheduled construction work, street planning , Transportation, Law Enforcement , Food and Agriculture, Unemployment and other benefits not just defense. Which seems to be the current primary usage. **Eg. Simulate the effects of raising minimum wage and finding the optimum % as opposed to trial and error.**

Holding PLTR long is only for the brave. **The share price** ***will*** **fluctuate**. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you ""*yOu'Ll nEvEr sEe ThEse prIcEs aGaIn, bUy nOw. $4o neXt wEek, $70 by Q2 $150 EOY!!.*

No one knows! You buy shares in companies you believe are greatly undervalued. And wait. Wait for the market to catch up.

**Alex Karp said it himself, if your short, kindly asks you to look for another company that fits your investing style because Palantir isn't for you.**

**Operator**

Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NexGen Energy Second Quarter of 2025 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. \[Operator Instructions\] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Leigh Curyer, Chief Executive Officer and Director with NexGen Energy Limited. Please go ahead, sir.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Thank you, Joseph. Good morning, and thank you for joining NexGen's Q2 2025 Financial Results and Investor Conference Call. My name is Leigh Curyer, and I am Chief Executive Officer. Today, I'm joined by Travis McPherson, Chief Commercial Officer; and Benjamin Salter, Chief Financial Officer.

On today's call, I'll discuss our exciting company advancements, including Rook 1 Project Readiness, Patterson Corridor East results, which strongly validate another significant mineral body is unfolding 3.5 kilometers to the east alongside Arrow. Further, the PCE results clearly suggest a very significant uranium mineralizing event has occurred in the Southwest region of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, on an unprecedented well scale and that we are really only at the beginning of defining its true extent. Further, the exciting developments in the uranium market over the quarter, including yesterday's announcement of NexGen doubling the volume in our offtake book, incorporating our key focus of market-related pricing mechanisms, ensuring NexGen Energy deliver industry- leading leverage to future prices whilst providing utilities with confidence with respect to volumes from Rook 1's technically, environmentally and socially operation. All in all, updating the critical role NexGen is set to play in delivering the world this vital clean energy fuel supply.

At the conclusion of this presentation, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call, where you have the opportunity to ask Travis, Ben and myself your questions. Throughout the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Please visit our website for all the relevant disclaimers. A few years ago, the idea of nuclear energy powering big tech, winning back global financing support and forming the cornerstone of national energy policy might have seemed optimistic. Today, it's happening. In just the past several weeks, we've witnessed a series of transformational developments that are reshaping global perceptions of nuclear energy. Developments that signal a clear structural shift is occurring today and forecast to extend well beyond 2050.

In Q2, corporate buyers, particularly hyperscalers and AI leaders moved aggressively to secure long-duration baseload power for their required energy needs. These technology companies have committed over USD 100 billion in AI data center construction, including Amazon's $20 billion spend on data centers in Pennsylvania; Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy to secure 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear generated electricity, which could power the equivalent of approximately 1 million homes. In addition, Constellation confirmed its nearing long-term nuclear fuel supplier deals with other hyperscalers.

Google has committed to fund the development of three advanced nuclear projects and TerraPower, and Orwell raised another combined USD 1.1 billion to develop small modular reactors. The race for energy and particularly clean baseload nuclear preferred is on the growth and demand has never been more robust. These are just a few examples of the decade-long commitments to nuclear energy from the most capitalized and data-dependent companies on the planet.

According to the International Energy Agency, data center demand for electricity is set to increase by 170% in China, 130% in the U.S., 80% in Japan and 70% in Europe over the next 5 years. This equates to an insatiable desire for uranium to fuel large portions of this demand through nuclear energy.

The reality is that current mine supply will not keep up with the existing demand and certainly not meet the exponential demand growth unless there are higher prices. Governments, including right here in Canada under Prime Minister Mark Carney, are also moving with urgency, fast-tracking regulatory frameworks, investing in small modular reactor development and emphasizing domestic supply chains as a matter of national security. In May, President Trump signed a series of executive orders to accelerate U.S. nuclear power development, aiming to quadruple nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Immediate actions include funding 5 gigawatt of upgrades for existing plants, starting construction on 10 new large-scale reactors by 2030, restarting closed or unfinished reactors, fast-tracking permitting by reforms and constructing at least three new reactors on by 2026. U.S. Department of Energy will also direct funding to new projects, invest in fuel cycle infrastructure, all to prioritize

U.S. energy security and supply chain independence. This is the most comprehensive nuclear policy ever seen, and it has a profound positive implications for NexGen, Western-based, low-cost, environmentally responsible and poised ready for construction on the conclusion of the CNSC commission hearing process commencing 1 of 2 sessions only 99 days from now.

In Canada, the passage of Bill C5 enables the Government of Canada to fast track major projects aligned with national, economic, environmental and indigenous priorities an approach that reinforces the direction NexGen has taken since its inception. While Rook 1 is already well advanced under the current regulatory framework, the passage of Bill C5 presents a clear opportunity for the federal government under Prime Minister Carney and Minister Hodgson's leadership to demonstrate this new legislation in action, something that is much needed in Canada in order for the country to realize its potential as a natural resources world leader. As a project that unambiguously meets the criteria of national interest, delivering economic benefit, environmental excellence and deep indigenous partnership through legally binding industry-leading benefit agreements.

In the first 10 years of forecasted production, Rook 1 is capable of providing $37 billion in economic benefit to Canada. We will support 1,400 direct jobs and be initially licensed beyond 2050. NexGen's Rook 1 project exemplifies every aspect of the criteria that Carney government has defined for projects to be prioritized through Bill C5, and we look forward to the conclusion of the CNSC process to deliver the many stakeholder-led benefits our project exhibits.

None of these developments are isolated. They are strategic signals from the private sector, financial institutions and government policymakers alike that nuclear energy has moved from the sidelines to the center of the global energy preference. Nuclear is not just part of the solution, it is foundational. At the core of this shift is a single truth. The world needs more electricity and it needs to be clean, reliable and affordable. It's not just about the power, it's about energy security, economic prosperity and national competitiveness, all underpinned by the requirement to supply the key ingredient, uranium.

All these developments and a lack of supply lay the groundwork for structurally higher uranium prices in the foreseeable future. The reality is that the industry at large, to some extent, still believes that this can all be solved with higher prices over a reasonable time frame. However, to meet the exceptional growth in demand we're seeing, you need many new Arrow-sized projects to be found, delineated, engineered, permitted, funded and built. Arrow is widely considered the most technically sound and environmentally benign deposit globally, and we are entering into the 12th year since its discovery. Our decision to relaunch exploration in 2023 at Rook 1 has paid immediate dividends, with our PCE discovery, which we will evaluate in significance as drilling and development advances. I'll speak more in a moment about PCE.

While the global policy environment accelerates, the uranium market is also gaining ground. In Q2, uranium spot prices rose over 20%, closing at USD 78.50 per pound, largely driven by the reentry of the Sprott Uranium Trust following a $200 million raise. It was a powerful reminder that the uranium market is very undersupplied and that when demand volume returns to the market, prices respond rapidly.

Further, yesterday, NexGen announced a new offtake agreement with a major U.S.-based utility, which doubles our contract book in volume. Importantly, and distinguishingly from past practices, our pricing on the 10 million pound contract book is all U.S. utilities and is market-related at the time of delivery, providing unprecedented leverage to investors in this rising uranium pricing environment. At the same time, given our superior technical setting and environmental design, it provides confident diversification of a new Western world supply.

Our contract book represents approximately 3% of our total defined resources and underscores NexGen's patient and strategic approach to building its sales book. We're in advanced discussions with utilities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and negotiations are increasingly urgent, informed and fast moving. With the commission's hearing set for September 25 and February 2026, NexGen is preparing to transition from advanced development to construction and subsequent operations.

Our current cash balance stands at CAD 375 million, with funding to complete the 2025 site programs and initiate development for the first 12 months of post-approval construction. We maintain full strategic optionality with a strong cash position and active engagement with global debt providers, sovereign funds and utilities, amongst others, resulting in financing interest well in excess of the full funding requirements of the build. As we always have, we will optimize the vast number of financing alternatives available for maintaining our production flexibility and ultimately maximizing the value of each pound of uranium we produce and sell.

At PCE during the quarter, NexGen announced our best discovery phase assay today. We drill hole RK-25-232, returning an incredible 15 meters at 15.9% U3O8, including an exceptional peak of 0.5 meters at 68.8%. This is amongst the best exploration intercepts in the world with Arrow hosting the majority of the other top 10. Since discovery, 45 holes at PCE have been resected mineralization. Of these, 12 have produced the ultra-high-grade massive replacement mineralization of over 61,000 counts per

second. We've been bold with our spacing, in some cases, over 200 meters apart and are still intersecting mineralization consistently, demonstrating the continuity of mineralization and the overall strength of the system.

Drilling to date at PCE confirmed the start similarities to the Mighty Arrow deposit just 3.5 Ks away. It's suggesting the early signs of another Tier 1 assay. It really does speak to the vast discovery potential of potentially more deposits on the Rook 1 property in the future. We also recently announced the consolidation of our entire land package, including PCE with the purchase of Rio Tinto's 10% production carried interest. It held on 39 of our claims. NexGen has secured a right of first refusal mechanism over this package after a third party made a bonafide offer to acquire it from Rio. NexGen now holds 100% ownership of all its claims in the district. This speaks to the acceptance by not only NexGen but others of the tremendous value in the Southwestern Athabasca Basin portfolio, which dominates the known and prospective trends in the district, a district which is often referred to as the future of uranium mine.

In response, we have received regulatory approval to expand our exploration infrastructure, including a temporary air strip, road for dualway traffic and expanded accommodations to support a growing team on site. This program is currently underway and scheduled to be completed in Q1 2026.

Our elite standards on responsible development continues to guide every part of the business. In May, we released our fifth annual sustainability report aligned with Global Reporting Initiative and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure Standards, highlighting major advancement across environmental, social and governance metrics. Through our growing education and workforce development programs, over 500 participants have engaged in NexGen-led training initiatives these past 2 years across a wide range of skilled trades. These programs developed in partnership with regional institutions and indigenous communities are designed to build capacity and create meaningful career paths aligned with the project's long-term needs. Indigenous leaders have publicly recognized NexGen's unique and leading collaborative approach with all four of the indigenous nations in the local project area citing NexGen as a benchmark for meaningful indigenous engagement and shared prosperity.

Keeping an eye -- I advise to keep an eye out for a video on our website about Chantelle Herman, who is one of a group of talented local students who have become members of the NexGen team, pursuing highly technical careers at NexGen while still living in their community. Chantelle is one of these leaders in the community and Travis and I met back in 2015 at the National School Volleyball tournament and went on through our summer student program, followed by a scholarship and is now a second year geology student university whilst working as a field geology technician at Rook 1. This is one of many great outcomes from the Rook 1 project and is the foundation of delivering even greater generational advancement of the project as it goes into construction and operation.

NexGen is well advanced on procurement with long lead and critical path items already ordered and in several cases, staged and secured in our warehouse. This progress reflects NexGen's fully integrated execution strategy and proactive supply chain planning, ensuring we are ready to begin major construction immediately upon final regulatory approval. With the team, materials and partnerships in place, Group 1 is execution ready. As we enter the next phase, our focus is clear; conclude approvals, finalize funding and begin building the most important new uranium project in a generation in a manner fully consistent with how NexGen have delivered the best results today across every aspect of the organization. At NexGen, we're advancing with clarity and conviction. We're executing with deep respect for the environment, communities, Saskatchewan, Canada, the world and our shareholders. We are energized by the opportunity to lead the future of nuclear. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to delivering further progress in the second half of the year. Thank you, and we will now open the call to your questions.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] And we will take our first question here coming from Katie Lachapelle with Canaccord.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Congrats on the new offtake. Similar to your previous agreements, you noted that it was a market-related contract. Two questions. Can you confirm if there's floors and ceilings in that new contract? And then as a follow-up, it appears that you're signing better terms relative to what some of your peer companies are announcing. Is that fair to say? And if so, what do you think is giving you that edge?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

I can confirm that our contracts as a blend are very substantially market-related prices at the time of delivery. There's not one contract that fits all. Contracts are very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of either the producer or the emerging producer and also that of the particular circumstances of the utility. I would make a general comment that U.S. utilities and particularly the larger ones do prefer a surety around future pricing. And so what you'll see with those contracts is an embedded floor and ceiling. And where that is the case with NexGen, and I want to say that we have 4 contracts in place, which cover all aspects, floor and ceiling, full spot and then also no floor and an extremely high ceiling. They are, based on our knowledge of the market, very strong relatively. And I think that speaks to a number of things. I think it's an overall assessment by utilities with respect to the state of the current mine supply worldwide. We're seeing some of the historical projects that have been getting back into production, not meeting expectation. And then we're also seeing significant sovereign and technical risk impact some of the current producing centers. So what NexGen represents and also the other advanced developers in Denison, particularly in Canada, is we provide an alternative or a diversified supply of this key important fuel. And I think that then ultimately gets reflected in the pricing from what has occurred in the past to what is actually about to unfold in the future. So I know that's a bit of a long-winded answer, but we are only conveying what we're experiencing, and that is what is driving our contract book.

**Katie Lachapelle**

Awesome. Maybe just one quick follow-up. In the past, you've indicated, I think it was upwards of USD 1.6 billion in lending interest from banks and other credit providers. Is that number around the same? Or has that changed? And now that you've got a couple of these offtake contracts in hand, do you feel like you're getting closer to finalizing an agreement on the debt side?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. And I'll hand over to Travis to answer.

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks, Katie. And as Leigh indicated, yes, it is growing, I would say. There's more parties getting involved seemingly every week, frankly. I think that's on the back of, obviously, all those banks signing that agreement to support the funding of this growth initiative by all these international governments. Also the bank was -- funding of nuclear projects well in excess of that and offtakes, I would say, do help the lending process, but it also opens up potentially new avenues of lending with government as an example. So -- but to be clear, the offtake contracts are being done kind of on an isolated basis based on our acceptance of those terms and everything like there -- it's not like we're conceding on anything that we want long term. So yes, it's very positive, and we're really interested to fund the full project along the time lines that we've indicated in the past, which is end of the year, into Q1 of next year ahead of the approval process. Also debt is one of the alternatives at hand. As Leigh mentioned in the earlier part of the call, we do have a number. I think it should be unsurprising the quality of the asset and which offers, but we have quite a few options at hand to fund the full project.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.

**Andrew D. Wong**

So just maybe back on financing a little bit. With regard to that, as you're having more of these conversations with various partners and there's more and more interest, what's your sense on the most likely path here? Is having a strategic asset or sorry, a strategic partner, the most preferred path and then maybe that's supplemented by debt or equity? Can you maybe just provide a sense on that?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. Thanks. Maybe I'll start...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Go ahead, Travis. Do you want to go?

**Travis G. McPherson**

Yes. I would say we don't have a preferred path at this stage, like we're keeping an open mind to all of the avenues at hand. They all come with -- well, first of all, they're all at various stages. I would say all of them are advanced, but obviously, various stages of how advanced they are. And so all of them are attractive in isolation or together. So I would say we're keeping a very open mind with respect to how this ultimately gets funded, although obviously, we are keeping our focus on our ability to be flexible with respect to production volumes and maintaining our leverage to future upside in prices. That's what I would say to that. And Leigh, obviously...

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, exactly. Look, our principle is to finance it in a manner that optimizes the production and the return on every pound produced. And we're working both streams, both the equity stream, project equity, debt and also the potential of a prepayment on the future supply of a volume of pounds. Each one of them comes with their costs and benefits, but the overall principle that we will incorporate when we conclude the package is optimizing the exposure to future uranium prices. And whilst we can't be specific on the debt-to- equity percentage or whether it's project equity or not, that will be the guiding principle. And we will be most likely concluding that in the first half of 2026 at the -- subject to respectfully, the conclusion of the CNSC hearing process.

**Andrew D. Wong**

Okay. Great. Then just maybe on the project itself in terms of construction, given that the approval might be coming sometime in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about how the project team is shaping up right now? Can you highlight any construction expertise you've hired or if there are any notable additions recently?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, it's a good question, Andrew, one that we don't make a lot of noise about. But behind the scenes, there's a very well-planned human resource execution that is going on. We've been adding to the team consistently since 2017 in line with the stage of development. Look, there's no doubt we've appointed some people that are ready to go and start constructing this mine. And obviously, we've -- when we've seen a quality hire, we've hired them on board. And they're very -- they're busy. They're not sitting around doing nothing, that's for sure. But -- so I would say on balance, we're probably over employed, but it is going to pay extreme dividends once we have that approval and we're into the construction phase.

The benefit of a long permitting process is it gives you plenty of opportunity to plan, plan, review, plan again and review again and I can tell you the construction plan is down to a finite detail. We know exactly what we're building. It's technically a very simple mine in a mining sense. And we've attracted the best in the business on to the team. We have a combination of both direct employees and consultants, but the overall philosophy of NexGen is that we don't delegate any decision-making. We have a person on the team that takes responsibility for their respective field and that responsibility ultimately rests with Travis and myself and the Board. And so we are very much owner constructor and operator model.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from Ralph Profiti with Stifel.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

Leigh and Travis, I just want to delve in a little bit on these two offtake contracts being held to a 5-year term. Was there appetite on the part of the counterparties to move those contracts out to a further tenure? And is what's holding back sort of movement on the floors and the ceilings? Or is this becoming the industry standard? Or I'm just wondering if there's other factors at play, specifically with regards to the tenure?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

We -- the contracts are very different dependent on the actual asset and the utility. There's not one contract that suits all. And that is also reflective of the utilities specific requirements. Utilities have a range of contracts with a range of suppliers and some are short term and some are long term. I would class ours as medium term in terms of length. And we are just at the beginning, we're at 3% of our total defined resources at Arrow. And we all know that the Arrow deposit is much larger and given its inferred resource, which will convert to indicated with subsequently closer space drilling.

I would say our philosophy is -- at the moment, we're negotiating a variety of between 3-year, 5-year and 10-year contracts. And it is really dependent on the specific circumstances of the utility. And those characteristics differ from one region to the next worldwide, like the U.S. utilities have a different preference to the Asian utilities who have a different preference to the European utilities. So I just want to make the point that there's not one contract in this market that fits all. It is very specific to the utility and very specific to the producer. What we offer is obviously a high level of confidence in volume given the technical simplicity of our project. And that is resonating strongly with the utility customers.

**Ralph M. Profiti**

That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And Leigh, you mentioned the Bill C5 a couple of times in your preprepared comments. And now that we're 6 months from that second CNSC hearing, it does sound like there's iterations going on with detailed engineering. I'm just wondering, has there been any scope changes with regards to plant, equipment or components in the design that are directly being driven by Bill C5. And the reason I'm asking is just to kind of think about scope changes in the early preconstruction phase of the project.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Interesting question, but the answer is no. Our scope, there's been absolutely no scope changes whatsoever, full stop, and we wouldn't be contemplating scope changes as a result of Bill C5. Our approach since even prior to discovery has been to deliver an environmentally elite approach along with a socially elite approach. And we have done that. And in every respect, we have exceeded the requirements of the legislation from a technical and environmental perspective. And also from a social perspective, it's well documented that we've been incredibly proactive in engaging and consulting with indigenous communities and implemented programs where there is incredibly strong collaboration between NexGen and the communities. And that actually even extends beyond those that are defined as impacted. So I think Bill C5 is a reflection of Prime Minister Mark Carney's government recognizing that there are elements of duplication to permit a resources project, not just specific to uranium, but major energy and national infrastructure projects. And I absolutely applaud them for recognizing that and introducing legislation that aims to make the whole process more efficient whilst maintaining incredibly high environmental and social standards that Canada leads the world in. So that's why we are in Canada. That absolutely is aligned with our values as an organization, and we are very proud to deliver this project to Canada in line with the very high environmental and social standards that Canadians expect.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from George Ross with Argonaut.

**Unidentified Analyst**

It's Sam. Just in regards to the production carried interest, when is the market going to be informed a little bit more on the cost, et cetera, attached to that?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Well, it's confidential as per the agreement of the clause that triggered it. And so, yes, we are unable to disclose what it means or what the cost was specifically in relation to that acquisition. I will say we are very pleased to have acquired it. We had approached Rio Tinto on it. And then, yes, bonafiding bid was received by an external party, which we do not even know the identity of. And so we triggered our right of first refusal. And whoever that party was, thank you for expediting the process.

**Unidentified Analyst**

Fair enough. Okay. And just in regards to the Patterson trend, any plans to sort of test along strike at this point, Leigh? Or it's very much just going to be focused on sort of defining the higher grades there at PCE?

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Our initial focus is to define and extend what we have at PCE. But look, we also have seen the results at Patterson, which is basically an extension of the trend, the Patterson Corridor East trend of our property, and they've hit mineralization as well. And what that says is that the whole conductor is very highly prospective for additional mineralization. As I speak, we've probably explored less than 1% of that actual Patterson Corridor East conductor trend. Similarly, with Arrow, we've explored less than 10% of that particular conductor corridor. And as everyone knows, you've got RRR that's along the Patterson Corridor conductor of our project. So the area is extremely well mineralized, and we are on the cusp or just at the very, very beginning of truly defining its true extent. We have 8 conductor corridors going through the Rook 1 project alone. There's no doubt there's been a significant mineralizing event in the region. And yes, we've put in an exploration camp to facilitate extensive exploration of that region of which we host 320,000 hectares. So it's incredibly exciting. It really is a geological phenom. And we are -- yes, there's a lot of drilling to be done before we can truly hold our hand on our hearts and say, you know what, this is the extent of it.

**Operator**

And our next question will come from \[ Fred Pollard, \] a private investor.

**Unidentified Analyst**

You mentioned Rook 1 is execution ready, and you've been held back, in my view, for some time now awaiting the federal approval process. You mentioned C5, and I have a couple of questions along that theme. So has C5 triggered some conversations with the government on advancing mine approval? And secondly, might there be some movement on the government schedule that you also mentioned earlier in the call? And I ask that because of the principles of fast tracking that are associated with Bill C5.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Thank you for the question. And it's a very topical question. Look, I would say that the introduction of Bill C5 from Prime Minister Carney is absolute recognition that there are some efficiencies that can be gained at the federal level, particularly after provincial approval and the indigenous community approval in the region of a specific project. And he's been very, very clear about that. And as a consequence, he's also going to resource a new project's office to help fast track the federal process. I absolutely applaud Prime Minister Carney and his ministers for that endeavor. I think in reality, the NexGen project is so advanced in the process that these initiatives are going to really benefit other projects that come after NexGen. And so we are resource industry advocates clearly. And we're really excited about that because like NexGen isn't going to fill the gap on its own. The world needs -- with respect to uranium, the world needs 2 to 3 Arrows and they need them now. So I think that's excellent news for every other advanced developer out there looking to get into construction. So specifically to our project, I think the benefit is most likely for other projects behind us, but I absolutely applaud the recognition and the importance that the federal government is placing on the expedition of major projects.

**Operator**

\[Operator Instructions\] Our next question will come from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.

**Brian MacArthur**

If I can just go back to the contracts, there's been a lot of talk about floors and ceilings. But can you confirm or deny, I guess, whether there are any volume options in those contracts? It sounds like there isn't the way you're talking about how much is committed, but I'm just trying to figure out how that part of the equation is working in all these contracts.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes, Brian, there's no volume discretion in the contracts by the utility or us as the supplier. I'd make -- and that's very clear. I'd make a general statement that the form and structure and pricing of the contracts are changing from what has been done in the past. The environment is changing. And the contracts which we are doing are different and have got different elements to what has been done in the past. And I think you're just going to see that naturally evolve over time as the scarcity and the risk, be it sovereign or technically around supply increases. And so yes, my overall comment is the environment is changing. There's no doubt about it. And what we are conveying to the market is what we are experiencing, and it's different for all companies. And as I said, it's very specific to the technical and sovereign profile of your supply and also very specific to the particular utilities preferences, and they differ between the U.S., Asia and Europe.

**Brian MacArthur**

Great. That's very clear. Second thing, can I just confirm there's been a couple of comments about the financing and timing, whether it's year-end or H1 next year and then comments around the CNSC approval. Could you have financing in place before the CNSC approval? And would that be subject to CNSC approval? Or are they sort of dependent on each other? Any comments on that? Just to clarify, I think, would be helpful.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. They're obviously related. And we -- look, if we were approved today, we would have concluded the financing. We've been well prepared for this for many years. But we can't really trigger the financing until we have approval to that extent. So as time -- as that final approval timetable unfolds, so will the financing. And terms or optionality may be better in the future given the way this environment is changing. And so we are just keeping our exposure to that in place. But I can assure you, we will conclude financing in short order post approval.

**Brian MacArthur**

There are just different time horizons talked about. So I was just trying to clarify that. I appreciate it.

**Operator**

And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leigh Curyer for any closing remarks.

**Leigh Robert Curyer**

Yes. Thank you all for listening and joining the Q2 call. Thank you for your questions. We certainly appreciate them and everyone's interest in this incredible project. And Q3 is going to be an incredible quarter ahead of us with everything that we're working on and the conclusion through the end of the year, not just what's happening at NexGen, but driven by what is happening in a very rapidly changing market environment. And we appreciate your interest in our project, and we look forward to continuing to deliver on the milestones that we have articulated.

451,1mbnu91,How Zionist Intelligence Networks Captured Western Power: From Rothschild Land Schemes to Epstein Blackmail and Unit 8200 Cyberwarfare,Fun_Baker_5843,/r/TheTransnationalElite/comments/1mbnu91/how_zionist_intelligence_networks_captured/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTransnationalElite/comments/1mbnu91/how_zionist_intelligence_networks_captured/,3,0,1753726532.0,"This is a primer about a powerful, organized, and deeply embedded network of Zionist operatives who used the state of Israel as a base and hides behind their own political opposition, and an evolving intelligence doctrine to infiltrate Western governments, media, and infrastructure.

When anti-Zionist Jews become too inconvenient, they are destroyed by the ZIonist elite; systematically and from all angles... financially, reputationally, and even murdered.

For those who don't know the history of how Zionism came to be and how even Hebrew was resurrected, geopolitics may seem like a confusing mess. Once you arm yourself with the right information, the geopolitical landscape becomes clear to see.

While the Zionist Elite are not the only transnational group of criminals, they are, now, the most prominent. From Rothschilds to Meyer Lansky to the MEGA Group, the thread of Zionists through government, organized crime, and financial domination by any means necessary reveals a dark and twisted world at the top.

I hope the following serves as a primer for the uninitiated; a jumping off point. Books can be written on each of these subjects individually, but no publisher will touch these subjects with any integrity.

First, you should know about the Rothschilds. You should also know about the MEGA Group.

---

## **The Rothschild Dynasty**

### **Historical Influence &amp; Financial Networks**

**Key Points**:

- **War Financing**: Historically funded European wars (e.g., Napoleonic Wars, WWI/WWII), establishing bonds as debt instruments. While not unique, their role in war debt created long-term dependencies between states and their financial apparatus.
- **Central Banking**: Indirect influence via advising institutions like the Bank of England and structuring bond markets. No direct ownership, but historical advisory roles enabled systemic leverage.
- **Gold &amp; Commodities**: Controlled the London Gold Fixing until 2004, influencing global gold pricing. Current stakes in Rio Tinto and Glencore suggest ongoing commodity market influence.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Opaque Financial Flows**: Historic use of offshore entities (e.g., Rothschild Continuation Holdings in Switzerland) raises questions about tax avoidance and capital movement.
- **Resource Control**: Mining/energy investments (e.g., Shell, BP) align with strategic geopolitical resources, potentially enabling supply-chain manipulation.

---

### **Modern Corporate &amp; Policy Affiliations**

**Key Entities**:

- **Rothschild &amp; Co**: Global M&amp;A advisory, restructuring sovereign debt (e.g., Greece, Argentina). Current leadership under Alexandre de Rothschild.
- **Edmond de Rothschild Group**: Manages $100B+ in assets, with private banking ties to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and governments.
- **Corporate Board Roles**:

- **De Beers** (diamonds): Influence over conflict mineral markets.
- **Groupe Casino** (retail): Access to consumer data and emerging markets.
- **Bilderberg Group/CFR**: Elite policy access, shaping globalization agendas.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Revolving Door**: Former Rothschild employees in government roles (e.g., Emmanuel Macron) suggest bidirectional influence.
- **Media Soft Power**: Historic ties to Reuters/Thomson Reuters; current philanthropic ventures (e.g., Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah) may legitimize geopolitical agendas.

---

### **Geopolitical Strategies &amp; Conflicts of Interest**

**Case Studies**:

- **Post-Soviet Privatization**: Advised Russian oligarchs and governments in the 1990s, profiting from undervalued asset sales.
- **EU Austerity Policies**: Rothschild &amp; Co’s role in Greek debt restructuring prioritized creditor returns over public welfare.
- **UK Utilities Privatization**: Advised Thatcher-era sell-offs, securing fees while shaping regulatory frameworks.

**Red Flags**:

- **Dual Advisory Roles**: Simultaneously advising governments and private entities (e.g., advising France on energy policy while holding Shell stakes).
- **Tax Minimization Schemes**: 2015 Spanish indictment of David de Rothschild highlights risks of exploitative financial instruments.

---

### **Philanthropy as Soft Power**

**Initiatives**:

- **World Jewish Congress**: David de Rothschild’s presidency amplifies influence over diaspora politics and Israel relations.
- **Environmental Ventures**: David’s “Plastiki” project and climate philanthropy align with ESG trends, potentially greenwashing resource-extractive investments.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Legitimization of Agendas**: Philanthropy may mask resource-driven investments (e.g., green energy projects tied to Rothschild-backed mining).

---

### **Structured For Influence**

The Rothschilds’ geopolitical influence stems from **structural access**, leveraging historic financial networks, corporate affiliations, and elite policy channels. Intelligence risks include:

- **Resource monopolization** via commodity investments.
- **Conflicts in sovereign advising** (profit vs. public interest).
- **Soft power through philanthropy/media**.

---

## I. The Blueprint: Land Theft Disguised as Philanthropy

Long before Israel became a state, the Rothschilds and their affiliates established the model: use philanthropy and diplomacy to mask geopolitical conquest.

* **Edmond de Rothschild** funded PICA (Palestine Jewish Colonization Association), buying Ottoman land via proxies and establishing front settlements.
* **Laurence Oliphant**, a British “diplomat,” conducted covert mapping of Arab resistance zones and water sources, creating a military-intel roadmap for later Zionist militias.
* **Alliance Israélite Universelle** operated early human terrain intel networks in Jerusalem under the guise of education.

Their strategy: register land via straw buyers, exploit tax loopholes, and rewrite the narrative by portraying Palestine as “a land without a people.”

---

## II. From HUMINT to Paramilitaries: The Vienna Nexus and Beyond

In 1913 Vienna, Zionist operatives ran proto-intelligence networks targeting ideological influencers:

* **Freud**, **Trotsky**, **Hitler**, and others were surveilled or manipulated.
* Zionists like **Jabotinsky** and **Arthur Hantke** used salons and cafés to recruit, profile, and sometimes provoke key figures to create pretexts for future action.
* Zionists experimented with **false flag tactics**, disinformation, and ideological baiting—skills refined over decades and later applied by Mossad, BlackCube, and Unit 8200.

---

## III. The Haavara Agreement: Zionist-Nazi Collaboration

In 1933, the Zionist Federation signed a secret pact with Nazi Germany to transfer Jewish wealth to Palestine. The **Haavara Agreement**:

* Allowed the Nazi regime to siphon Jewish assets.
* Used confiscated Jewish capital to fund Zionist settlements.
* Undermined international boycotts of Germany.
* Resulted in the deaths or economic destruction of tens of thousands of Jews.

Zionist elites like **Chaim Arlosoroff** and **Arthur Ruppin** prioritized state-building over saving lives and they were happy to dump off the Jews that were politically inconvenient to the Zionist agenda.

---

## IV. 1948: Ethnic Cleansing via False Flags

To establish Israel’s sovereignty, Zionist militias like **Irgun** and **Lehi** executed a series of false flag operations and terror campaigns:

* **Semiramis Hotel Bombing**: Haganah attack blamed on Arabs.
* **Deir Yassin Massacre**: Used psychological warfare to induce mass Arab flight.
* **Ben Yehuda Street Bombing**: Disguised Jewish militants blamed Arabs to radicalize Jewish moderates.

These tactics laid the groundwork for Israel’s founding myth while hiding systematic ethnic cleansing.

---

## V. Lavon Affair: Israel Bombed Allies, Blamed Muslims

In 1954, Israeli military intel (Aman) launched **Operation Susannah**, bombing U.S. and British targets in Egypt to drive a wedge between Cairo and the West.

* Agents used Egyptian Jews as operatives.
* When exposed, Israel disavowed responsibility, scapegoated Defense Minister **Pinhas Lavon**, and destroyed incriminating evidence.
* CIA memos confirm Israeli culpability.

This became a template for future false flag terror.

---

## VI. USS Liberty: Deliberate Attack on the U.S.

In 1967, Israeli jets and torpedo boats attacked the USS Liberty:

* 34 Americans killed; 174 wounded.
* Intercepted Israeli comms confirm they **knew** it was an American ship.
* NSA jamming evidence and survivor testimonies point to an attempt to frame Egypt.
* President Johnson covered it up to protect the Israeli alliance.

---

## VII. Jonathan Pollard: Espionage with Impunity

Pollard, a U.S. Naval intel analyst, handed **over 1 million classified documents** to Israel, including:

* Nuclear targeting data.
* SIGINT intercepts.
* Names of U.S. agents in Arab nations.

Despite this massive betrayal, Israel shielded his handlers and celebrated him as a hero. The U.S. response? A slap on the wrist and later concessions.

---

## VIII. The Epstein Nexus: Mossad’s Global Kompromat Machine

Jeffrey Epstein was not just a predator. He was a **kompromat asset** linked directly to Israeli intelligence:

* Funded by **Leslie Wexner**, who gifted him a \$77M townhouse used for surveillance.
* Ghislaine Maxwell’s father, **Robert Maxwell**, was a Mossad asset.
* Epstein's homes were wired for audio/video—used to blackmail politicians, scientists, and royalty.

Flight logs show **Ehud Barak**, **Bill Clinton**, and others made repeated visits. The “client list” remains classified—not for justice, but for leverage.

---

## IX. The Mega Group: Zionist Billionaires and Policy Capture

A shadowy cabal including **Wexner**, **Bronfman**, **Black**, and **Lauder**:

* Funds NGOs that smear critics as “antisemites.”
* Controls media narratives via outlets and philanthropic pressure.
* Uses Epstein-style kompromat to direct policy—e.g., pushing for Jerusalem embassy move or shielding spyware firms from regulation.

Declassified memos reveal Mega Group members discussed “leverage acquisition” and data collection through Epstein’s operations.

---

## X. Unit 8200 and Digital Colonialism

Israel’s **Unit 8200** turned SIGINT tools into global spyware firms:

* **NSO Group (Pegasus)**: Used to murder Khashoggi, spy on Macron, sabotage African elections.
* **BlackCube**: Covert ops firm for oligarchs and predators like Weinstein.
* **Candiru**: Silent hacks targeting Palestinian activists, Indian opposition, and European MPs.

These companies are state-backed, licensed by Israel’s Defense Ministry, and funded through Rothschild-linked capital (RIT, VMS).

---

## XI. 9/11 and Suspicious Israeli Activity

* Mossad-linked “art students” surveilled U.S. facilities before the attacks.
* Five Israelis were caught celebrating and filming the towers’ collapse. Later deported.
* **Urban Moving Systems**, their employer, was a Mossad front.

FBI memos confirm an extensive Israeli spy ring was active in the U.S. just before the attacks. Media buried it. DOJ sealed the files.

---

## XII. The Epstein “No List” Debacle Was the Final Straw

The refusal to release Epstein’s client list is not about privacy—it’s about **impunity**. It proves that:

* Zionist kompromat operations are still active.
* The same network that manipulated the Holocaust for geopolitical cover now uses sex tapes, spyware, and political donations to control Western policy.
* Intelligence agencies are complicit.

**This is not ""antisemitism."" This is evidence-based opposition to Zionism as a covert empire.**

Zionist intelligence has become a rogue, transnational actor with nuclear weapons, a global spyware empire, and elite blackmail leverage. It’s time we exposed it—not for vengeance, but for liberation.

---
## 🚨 The Mega Group

The **Mega Group** is a real and influential yet **highly secretive organization** consisting of **wealthy Jewish-American businessmen and philanthropists**. It has gained notoriety due to its **behind-the-scenes influence**, ties to **Israeli intelligence**, and possible links to the **Jeffrey Epstein network**, particularly in regard to surveillance and blackmail operations.

---

## 🔐 CONNECTION TO INTELLIGENCE

The **Mega Group** has long-standing, deeply interwoven connections to:

- **Mossad** (Israeli intelligence)
- **U.S. intelligence liaisons** and former CIA operatives
- **Covert funding and influence operations** to promote pro-Israel agendas, and possibly surveillance infrastructure

### Allegations include:

- Use of **charity networks and philanthropic cover** for surveillance
- Possible support or shielding of **Epstein’s operations** as a kompromat (blackmail) asset
- Epstein’s Manhattan property (owned by Wexner) was rigged with **hidden surveillance systems**

---

## 🔍 THE “MEGA” NAME ORIGIN

The name “Mega” was first publicly noted in:

- **1997 NSA memo leak**: U.S. intelligence suspected an Israeli mole in the Clinton White House codenamed “MEGA”
- Later, investigative journalist **Whitney Webb** and others speculated the Mega Group name could have originated from this context — possibly related to **MEGA-donors** or to literal intel code names

---

## 📎 EPSTEIN AND THE MEGA GROUP

- **Leslie Wexner** was Epstein’s primary enabler and financial backer — even granting him **power of attorney**.
- **Mega Group networks overlapped with Maxwell family networks** (Ghislaine’s father, Robert Maxwell, was a known Mossad asset).
- **Alexander Acosta**, former U.S. Attorney, once reportedly said he was told to “back off Epstein” because “he belonged to intelligence.”

Some researchers believe:

- **Epstein’s operation** was a **modern iteration of sexual kompromat programs**, designed to gather dirt on powerful people — and potentially managed or tolerated by intelligence services operating through groups like Mega.

---

## 🏛️ POLICY AND CULTURE INFLUENCE

In addition to covert influence, the Mega Group members:

- Fund **think tanks**, **media outlets**, and **NGOs** to promote **Israel-first policies** and shape U.S. foreign policy
- Played central roles in **Birthright Israel**, **AIPAC**, and **neoconservative networks**
- Donated extensively to both **Republican and Democratic** causes

---

## 🕳️ SECRECY AND LIMITATIONS

Despite the group's wealth and influence:

- **No official website**
- **No public membership roster**
- Few media mentions — **almost entirely ignored by mainstream press**

#The Transnational Elite

**Zionism**, originally a 19th-century movement to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine, has evolved into a **transnational ideological, political, and financial force**. The **Mega Group**, and actors like Epstein, fit into a broader system of **Zionist-aligned influence networks** that operate across:

* **Intelligence** (Mossad and allied agencies)
* **Finance** (hedge funds, real estate, shadow banking)
* **Media** (legacy press, social platforms)
* **Law and lobbying** (AIPAC, ADL, lawfare tactics)
* **Blackmail and kompromat** (via entrapment, video surveillance)

---

## 🧩 1. HOW THE MEGA GROUP FITS

The **Mega Group** is effectively a **Zionist power cartel**—not officially Israeli, but aligned with Israel’s interests:

| Mechanism                       | Role                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Funding Israel-aligned NGOs** | e.g. Birthright, Friends of the IDF                       |
| **Political donations**         | Bipartisan — to ensure Israel-first foreign policy        |
| **Intelligence overlap**        | Wexner–Epstein pipeline possibly tied to Mossad           |
| **Narrative control**           | Quiet influence over media, academia, arts                |
| **Cultural laundering**         | Philanthropy softens public perception of Zionist actions |

Mega’s founding members (Bronfman, Wexner, Steinhardt, etc.) are **Zionist billionaires** who operate as a **civilian front** for deeper statecraft — parallel to how the **World Jewish Congress** or **ADL** operate in the information realm.

---

## 🧠 2. ZIONIST INFLUENCE AS A GLOBAL SYSTEM

Zionism isn’t just about **Israel** — it’s a **networked system of power**. Some core components include:

### A. **Military &amp; Intelligence Integration**

* Mossad has **deep interoperability** with CIA, MI6, and Five Eyes.
* Epstein/Maxwell-style operations likely served **shared interests** — **blackmail** to control politicians.
* Israeli firms like **NSO Group**, **Black Cube**, and **Unit 8200 spin-offs** provide cyber tools for surveillance and disruption — often to **governments and billionaires**, not just Israel.

### B. **Policy Capture**

* **AIPAC**, **CUFI**, and other lobbying orgs ensure **unwavering U.S. support for Israel**.
* Politicians who criticize Zionist influence are **marginalized or destroyed** (e.g., Cynthia McKinney, Ilhan Omar).
* Legislation criminalizing **BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction)** activism has been pushed in multiple U.S. states — often coordinated by Israeli NGOs.

### C. **Financial Control**

* Zionist billionaires dominate sectors like:

  * **Finance**: Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Apollo (Leon Black), Soros Foundation
  * **Real estate**: Wexner, Kushner, Zuckerman
  * **Crypto**: Sam Bankman-Fried had significant Israeli ties
* Massive cross-donation networks protect allies and **punish critics** economically.

### D. **Media Narratives**

* Legacy media ownership overlaps with Zionist-aligned moguls (e.g., **Zuckerman**, **Murdoch**, **IAC/Barry Diller**).
* Accusations of antisemitism are **weaponized** to shut down legitimate critique of Zionist power structures.

---

## 🔐 3. EPSTEIN’S ROLE IN THE ZIONIST INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS

Many researchers — most notably **Whitney Webb** — have suggested Epstein operated as:

&gt; A **modern Maxwell-like asset**, running sexual kompromat ops to control U.S. and global elites.

### Why this matters:

* It **shields Zionist political goals** through leverage.
* Entraps powerful people — including **scientists, royals, presidents** — ensuring cooperation.
* Ties into **technology transfer**: Epstein funded AI, biotech, and eugenics-like science under the guise of philanthropy.

&gt; His Manhattan townhouse — gifted by Wexner — was rigged with **surveillance tech**, consistent with **Mossad-style honeytrap tactics**.

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Politics**          | Lobbying, dual-citizenship policy agents        | U.S. policy subservient to Israel’s regional goals |
| **Military**          | Joint training, weapons co-dev, cyber ops       | Israel becomes **unaccountable nuclear state**     |
| **Finance**           | Banking, tax shelters, privatization scams      | Enormous leverage over global markets              |
| **Intelligence**      | Surveillance tools, honeytraps, front companies | Elites controlled or compromised                   |
| **Media &amp; Narrative** | Thought-policing, false antisemitism charges    | Critique = canceled, truth = buried                |

---

## 🚨 Important Takeaway

The **Mega Group** is a **central node** in the transnational web of **Zionist elite influence**. Not “the puppetmaster” — but part of the apparatus that:

* **Enables control through soft and hard power**
* **Shields criminal operations** (Epstein, Finders, NXIVM) if they serve the network
* **Suppresses dissent** through media, finance, and lawfare

This exposes **a power structure cloaked in religious and ethnic protection**, while operating as a **supranational oligarchy**.

---

## **A Century of Controlled Opposition**

What you’ve been told about Zionism is a carefully constructed legend. The truth is buried in declassified archives, psychological operations manuals, and the corpses of those who opposed the agenda. I’ve spent two decades running assets, laundering narratives, and watching how real power operates. The Zionist project was never about ""saving Jews."" It was—and remains—a recursive infiltration model designed to consolidate elite control under the guise of nationalism.

Netanyahu isn’t an outlier. He’s the logical endpoint of a playbook written in blood and ratified in shadowy rooms from Vienna (1913) to Istanbul (1944) to Washington (today).

---

### **A Century of Psychological Warfare and Manufactured Consent**  

What we’ve uncovered here isn’t just history—it’s a **blueprint for mass manipulation**, one that continues to shape geopolitics today. The evidence shows a deliberate, systematic effort by a small Zionist elite to **hijack Jewish survival** and redirect it toward a political project—**by any means necessary**.  

#### **The Core Strategy: Fear as a Weapon**  
From the very beginning, Zionist leaders understood that **trauma could be weaponized**. They didn’t just exploit antisemitism—**they amplified it when necessary**:  
- **Pre-WWII:** The Haavara Agreement proved Zionists would **work with Nazis** if it served their demographic goals.  
- **Post-WWII:** False flags in DP camps (like the Stuttgart leaflets) **manufactured panic** to push Jews toward Palestine.  
- **Today:** The conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism **silences dissent**—just as Bundists and anti-Zionist Jews were silenced in the 1940s.  

This wasn’t rescue. **It was social engineering at gunpoint.**  

#### **The Elite’s Dirty Secret: Not All Jews Were Meant to Survive**  
The Kasztner Train deal exposed the cold calculus: **save the useful, abandon the rest**.  
- Zionist leaders **prioritized young, able-bodied settlers** over the elderly, the religious, or the politically inconvenient.  
- Dissenters—like Jewish communists in the USSR—were **actively undermined** by Nativ operatives.  

This **ruthless triage** continues today:  
- **Haredim** who reject Zionism? **Drafted into the IDF against their will.**  
- **Anti-war activists?** Smeared as ""self-hating Jews.""  
- **Holocaust memory?** Weaponized to justify Gaza, just as DP camp fears were used to justify mass migration in 1948.  

#### **The Cover-Up: How History Was Rewritten**  
The sanitized version of Zionism relies on **three big lies**:  
1. **""There was no alternative""** (False—Bundists, assimilationists, and anti-Zionist Jews **fought for other futures**).  
2. **""All Jews supported Israel""** (False—many **resisted**, and were **erased from history**).  
3. **""Criticism is antisemitism""** (False—it’s a **deliberate silencing tactic**).  

Archives prove this. Yet museums, films, and schools **omit the evidence** because the truth undermines the myth.  

#### **Modern Parallels: Netanyahu’s Israel and the Same Old Tricks**  
- **False Flags:** Just like the 1948 Stuttgart leaflets, we see **staged atrocities** (e.g., the ""40 beheaded babies"" narrative).  
- **Manufactured Crises:** Hamas was **funded by Israel** (per *Times of Israel*, 2019) to create a ""manageable enemy.""  
- **Psychological Coercion:** Western Jews are told **Israel = survival**, just as DP camp survivors were told **Palestine = safety**.  

The goal remains the same: **Keep Jews afraid. Keep them obedient. Keep the project alive.**  

### **The Uncomfortable Truth**  
Zionism was **never about saving Jews**—it was about **building a state**, no matter the cost. And the cost was paid in:  
- **Jewish lives sacrificed** in negotiations with Nazis.  
- **Jewish dissent crushed** in the name of unity.  
- **Jewish history rewritten** to erase alternatives.  

Today, the same machinery grinds on: **Holocaust guilt fuels blank checks for Israel, while non-Zionist Jews are marginalized as ""traitors.""**  

#### **The Question No One Wants to Ask**  
If Zionism *truly* represented all Jews… **why did it need propaganda, false flags, and coercion to succeed?**  

The answer is clear: **Because consent was manufactured, not earned.**

**Final Thought:** 

This isn’t ancient history. The same tactics—**fear, manipulation, elite control**—are still used today. The only difference? **Now they have a state, an army, cyber tools to spy on you and an AI enhanced propaganda machine to enforce the narrative.**

**Recent Activity:**

$RVSN secured patents in India, the U.S., countries throughout the EU, and Japan over the past two months. This is no small feat and should be regarded as a technically strategic series of accomplishments, as locking-up patents in multiple countries within a 60-day period is coordination, not coincidence. Rather, they intend to take the deep learning and AI railway market niche by storm. Despite their humble market cap, $RVSN secured proof of concept contracts with Rio Tinto Mining in Australia and a major Latin America (LATAM) mining company railway system more than three years ago. $RVSN has equipped partnership with both Hitachi and NVIDIA. Last week, when its partnership with NVIDIA was announced, the stock price rose from more than 100% and back down again, literally in less than 120 seconds.

**The Plan:**

The company is currently operating in what's known as ""stealth mode"". $RVSN secured patents in India, the U.S., countries of the EU, and Japan over the past two months. This is no small feat and should be regarded as a technically coordinated series of accomplishments, as locking-up patents in multiple countries at once within a 60-day period is no coincidence. Rather, they intend to take this market niche by storm. Did you know they secured proof of concept contracts with Rio Tinto in Australia and a major Latin America (LATAM) mining company railway system more than three years ago? $RVSN, equipped w/partnerships w/Hitachi and NVIDIA, is operating in what's known as ""stealth mode"".

**Current Status:**

While in stealth mode, companies operate in secrecy or with minimal public visibility as much as they can for various strategic reasons. During this period, the company may work on developing its technology, securing patents, finalizing proof of concept projects, and raising capital without drawing attention from competitors, the media, or the public. The primary objectives of operating in stealth mode include:

1. Protecting Intellectual Property
2. Focusing on Product Development
3. Strategic Market Entry

Stealth mode is particularly common in technology and biotech sectors, where the development cycle for new products or technologies can be lengthy and the competitive advantage lies significantly in innovation and being first to market. Once the company ""steps into the light,"" it typically has a developed product or technology ready to launch, secured patents protecting its innovations, and possibly several rounds of funding to support its growth and expansion.

Signs $RVSN is operating in stealth mode?

1. The sheer rate of its patents.
2. Its use of Rule 144 in using SAFE conversion.
3. Its election to operate as an emerging growth company on its latest SEC filings.
4. Its leveraging of Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933 to offer securities on a continuous basis.

**The Logic:**

Think about how many train accidents could be prevented with an AI-based deep-learning apparatus that can collect and analyze data continuously on 1-2 mile of track in front of passenger and commercial trains? And they haven't even gotten into using facial recognition software yet as a loss prevention measure in cases of robbery and theft. For those of you in the U.S., 2022 and 2023 were the years of trains breaking down, hazardous material leaks, and railway theft.

453,1lfnwcd,Worley CEO Chris Ashton is doubling his workforce at the engineering company using AI,Ardeet,/r/aussie/comments/1lfnwcd/worley_ceo_chris_ashton_is_doubling_his_workforce/,https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/leaders/the-ceo-of-this-7b-company-is-doubling-his-workforce-by-using-ai-20250509-p5lxxt,0,2,1750371932.0,"# The CEO of this $7b company is doubling his workforce – by using AI

  
*Worley chief executive Chris Ashton says artificial intelligence will enable one engineer to do the job of two people, or three, or four.*

Chris Ashton, the chief executive of the $7 billion, ASX-listed global engineering group Worley, recently took an example of an artificial intelligence calculation to the board to explain how his 45,000 staff could do the work of 90,000 employees.

“We showed this to our board, an engineer doing a calculation to understand what thickness a wall should be if it’s carrying a product of a particular pressure,” Ashton tells BOSS from the business centre at Melbourne’s Grand Hyatt during a visit from his US home in Houston.

“Let’s say an engineer can do one calculation every three hours. With this technology, rather than having four people do four calculations over three hours, you can have one person do the same,” he says, adding that most of his staff have two or three degrees.

“Artificial intelligence will allow you to \[have\] one engineer act like they are two, or three or four,” he says in a thick, northern English accent.

One AI application already up and running at Worley is used to assist the company’s procurement teams working on technical evaluations of vendor bid documents, reducing the time spent on data extraction from weeks to hours.

Ashton has a vested interest in leveraging the size and skill of his workforce. Faced with a shortage of engineers, the executive says [AI will enable Worley to make the most of what it has](https://www.afr.com/companies/professional-services/genai-helps-engineers-cut-response-time-from-weeks-to-minutes-20250217-p5lcr7). It is not about [replacing white-collar workers](https://www.afr.com/technology/amazon-chief-warns-white-collar-staff-their-jobs-are-on-the-line-20250618-p5m8am).

The company doubled in size in 2019, from about 30,000 people to close to 60,000, after its $4.5 billion acquisition of the Jacobs Engineering Group’s Energy, Chemicals and Resources (ERC) division. Since then, it has contracted back to about 45,000 and finding enough engineers each year remains a major challenge.

“Last year, we hired 700 graduates, but that’s only 1.5 per cent of our workforce. We’ve got more than 1.5 per cent of people retiring each year,” Ashton says.

The CEO is also trying to rectify the gender imbalance. This year’s graduate intake in Australia was 52 per cent women, and women in project manager roles have grown to 22 per cent, up from just 9.5 per cent three years ago.

# Gas critical, nuclear not

The global engineering giant is a little-known Australian success story. It was founded by local structural engineer John Grill, who bought the company as a shell more than 50 years ago and ran the business until 2012 – and to this day he remains the chairman.

Former Dow Chemical Company CEO Andrew Liveris and former Treasury boss Martin Parkinson are on the board.

Ashton says Grill, for all his considerable achievements, was no marketer, which is why most Australians do not know the company, despite it sitting behind many of the country’s largest resources companies such as BHP, Rio Tinto, Woodside Energy and Santos.

“The mines have to be designed, equipment and facilities designed and built,” he says. “We’ll do the construction and management of facilities, we do that for iron ore, copper, lithium, gas, nuclear, oil and gas refineries, LNG and chemical plants.”

Its reach is truly global, with most of its employees and revenue coming from outside Australia, despite its origins and local listing.

“We have more employees outside Australia than any other Australian company,” Ashton boasts.

Worley’s 12,000 projects are some of the largest energy projects in the world. It has just been selected by energy developer Glenfarne to deliver engineering services for the $US44 billion Alaska LNG pipeline in the US.

It is acting on the Northern Endurance Partnership and the Net Zero Teesside Power projects, two of the UK’s most important carbon capture and low-carbon power projects.

Worley is also working with battery materials and technology company Talga to deliver engineering, procurement and construction for the Vittangi graphite anode project in Sweden, which is critical to Europe’s green transition.

Ashton says the company does not do as much work in wind and solar because it is such a highly competitive sector. The focus is on more complex energy facilities.

But the CEO, who drives an electric Ford Lightning pickup truck himself, says that Australia has natural strengths in wind and solar, which, if properly complemented with gas, could deliver a net zero economy.

“The reality is globally what we see around the world is that gas is an essential element of the energy transition,” he says.

Despite Worley’s long experience in nuclear energy, Ashton doesn’t believe it is needed in Australia.

“We’ve got a long history working in nuclear but nuclear has always been contentious,” he says. “Australia has other natural resources like gas and plenty of space for wind and solar. I think Australia can move to a low-carbon economy without nuclear.”

# 3 countries, 3 continents, 17 homes

Ashton’s path to the top of the corporate tree has been anything but linear.

“I left school at 16 and was in the north-east of England,” says the 58-year-old.

“There were four major industries, ship building, coal mines, steel mills and chemical plants and there was an expectation, if you left school you did an apprentice in one of those industries,” he says.

“I made a decision, I wasn’t going to go down a coal mine. The steel mill and chemical plants were too far away, but the shipyard was a mile and a half from where I grew up, so I could walk to work. I left school on the Friday and started as an electrical apprentice there on the Monday.”

Ashton started night school and his boss agreed to drive him, which he did for three nights a week over two years.

By the time Ashton graduated in 1989, the shipyards were closing down. “Margaret Thatcher was in full swing,” he recalls.

He went to work at chemicals company ICI. From there, Ashton went to Shell where he worked offshore for two years, before going back to school to do an MBA.

Ashton joined Parsons ERC in 1998 and moved to Houston with the business in 2000. He met his wife while in the US and the couple had a daughter, now 13.

When Worley bought Parsons ERC in 2004, Ashton was brought on board, which led to a decade of moving across the world. “Three states \[Texas, California, Philadelphia\], three countries \[US, UK and United Arab Emirates\] and three continents. I’ve lived in 17 homes, just since I’ve joined Worley.

“What I’ve said to people \[is\] that if you want to develop your career, you’ll do it more quickly if you’re willing to move to an opportunity rather than waiting for an opportunity to move to you,” he says.

“In my 27 years, I’ve only turned down one opportunity and that was to move to Angola in 2005. Do not think of your career as being linear. Be willing to move around to develop a multi-skills package.”

In 2005, he moved to LA to run the western region of the US. In 2009, the family moved to Philadelphia, where he ran the US power business, and in 2011, he was promoted to run the global power business. In 2013, he was moved to Abu Dhabi, but after nine months he moved back to London to run Europe, Middle East and Africa.

After the Jacobs acquisition in 2019, Ashton was appointed chief operating officer and tasked with bringing the two businesses together. His key job was developing a strategy, which he was asked to implement as the new CEO from 2020.

One of Ashton’s first tasks was designing a new purpose statement and set of values for the business. The group held 80 workshops with the staff across the globe.

The purpose statement became delivering a more sustainable world.

Ashton said in February that the US President Donald Trump’s administration was [“net positive” for the business](https://www.afr.com/companies/infrastructure/worley-expects-profit-boost-from-trump-energy-policies-20250225-p5lew7) because it was sparking a resurgence in new fossil fuel projects.

Investors are cautiously optimistic with JPMorgan, UBS and Macquarie Equity Research all encouraged that Worley maintained its earnings guidance during an investor day in May, despite the global uncertainty.

“Expectations going into the investor day were low, with concerns around recent volatile US policies driving customers to pull back on capital spending,” JPMorgan said in a note.

“However, Worley reiterated 2025 guidance and highlighted the agility, flexibility and diversification of the business that enable it to maintain resilience throughout market cycles.

“Management emphasised its competitive advantages and strategic initiatives \[including AI\] that continue to pave the way for margin expansion and growth, consistent with previous commentary,” it said.

“The key concern from here remains the ability for customers globally to have enough confidence to make capital allocation decisions in the current environment.”",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.720301,2025-06-20T08:25:32,Rio Tinto,2025

Previously, they only signed short contracts to renegotiate on favorable terms, now we are commited for 20 years. This is a bad deal for nz. $79,000 in carbon tax per employee at todays prices but will be multiples of this that the taxpayer has to fund. Even if not hydrogen, we have proven commercial deposits of alliminium in northland considered the best calcite clay in the world.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, &amp; **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&amp;GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.720333,2021-05-28T10:11:27,RT,2021

I've been outspoken in calling out Albanese for pursuing his free Qantas upgrades, but the pearl clutching from the Opposition and News Corp is so obviously disingenuous because they sat unperturbed through corruption scandal after corruption scandal from the Morrison Government.

There needs to be a uniformed reset of what behaviour we accept in Canberra... it's probably up to our Independents to set that standard, because clearly none or the major parties are going to do it.

The below is an excerpt from a post I made four years ago detailing just SOME of the Coalitions corruption scandals.

#SpyGate
Bo 'Nick' Zhao, a Chinese born Australian goes to ASIO telling them he's been offered a $1million from the Chinese Government to run as a Liberal Party candidate and then infiltrate the Australian Parliament as a Chinese Spy. 

He then turns up dead in a Melbourne hotel room in March. 

Enter Gladys Liu, the Liberal Candidate with a host of concerning connections to the Chinese Government who earns Liberal pre-selection thanks to miraculously raising a million dollars in donations. 

Fairfax then discovered a photo of Liu at her home with Nick Zhao in the back ground. 

Gladys is now the Liberal Member for Chisolm.

#SignGate
Liberal Candidates Gladys Liu and Josh Frydenberg both have Mandarin signs at polling booths in the colours of the Australian Electoral Commission branding telling Chinese citizens how to vote (by putting 1 next to the Liberal Candidate). There is no Liberal Party branding on the sign 

Liberal officials admit in court that the signs were designed to convey the appearance of official electoral commission material.

#Robodebt
In 2016, the Government set up an automated debt recovery mechanism to recover welfare overpayments. 

However the calculations used by the system were deeply flawed and demanded repayments from thousands who hadn't been overpaid a cent. 

To make matters worse, the new process reversed the onus of proof on the recipient to prove they hadn't been overpaid. 

Over 2000 Australians died after receiving Robodebt notices. A large (although unknown) number have been attributed to self harm. 

In 2020, the Government finally admitted the system was flawed and paid back or forgave $1.2billion in debts.

458,1jnybml,A Look at Mader Group - Uncovered Gem?,ASX_News,/r/ausstocks/comments/1jnybml/a_look_at_mader_group_uncovered_gem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausstocks/comments/1jnybml/a_look_at_mader_group_uncovered_gem/,3,1,1743409103.0,"**Company Overview**

Mader Group Limited (ASX: MAD) is an Australian-based provider of specialist technical services for heavy equipment maintenance in the mining, energy and industrial sectors. Founded in 2005, Mader has grown into a global business servicing over 430 customers across 570+ locations worldwide. The company’s core offering is “tap on, tap off” maintenance support – deploying skilled mechanics and technicians to keep heavy mobile machinery and fixed infrastructure running optimally through in-field repairs, overhauls, preventive maintenance, and training services.​

Mader operates an asset-light model, which allows it to mobilise teams quickly across different regions. Mader has a workforce of over 3,200 and regional offices supporting operations across Australia, North America, Asia, Africa and Oceania.

**Customer &amp; Geographic Profile​**

Mader’s main customers are mining and resource companies and related contractors. Its client base includes some of the world’s largest miners, including BHP Group, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals and CITIC Pacific Mining. These clients operate large fleets of trucks, excavators, drills and other heavy equipment that require regular maintenance.

In FY24, approximately 24% of the Mader’s revenue was from five key customers, and the top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of the company’s revenue.”​ Whilst no single customer contributed over 10% of revenue in FY24, the business does remain somewhat reliant on a concentrated base of large resource clients.

Mader has expanded to serve a diverse range of industries and geographies. Within resources, the company’s technicians work across multiple commodities – from iron ore and coal to gold, copper and lithium. In the energy sector, Mader’s dedicated Mader Energy division supports oil and gas operations (such as servicing natural gas compression equipment in U.S. shale fields​).

Mader’s largest operations are in Australia (where it services all major mining states) and North America. In the United States, Mader now operates in 37 states. It established a foothold in Canada in 2021 and expanded to 8 provinces. The company also maintains a “Rest of World” segment covering work in Asia and recently re-entered Africa by securing a 12-month maintenance contract in Zambia.

For FY24, the revenue split by region was as follows​:

\- Australia: $585.7 million (approximately 75.6% of total revenue)

\- North America: $177.8 million (approximately 23%)

\- Rest of the World: $11.0 million (approximately 1.4%)

**Financial Performance &amp; Growth Catalysts**

Mader Group has delivered strong growth over the past 3 years. Annual revenue nearly doubled from $402 million in FY2022 to $774.5 million in FY2024, a 27% year-on-year increase in the latest year. This growth has been entirely organic, reflecting a greater volume of work across all regions.

Heavy customer demand for Mader’s core mechanical services in Australia drove a 25% revenue increase in FY2024. North American revenue also grew 34% in FY2024 despite some softening in commodity markets. Here’s a snapshot of the FY24 financials:

\- Total Revenue: $774.5m, +27%

\- EBITDA: $99.2m, +32%

\- EBITDA Margin: 12.8%, +0.5 ppt

\- NPAT: $50.4m, +31%

\- NPAT Margin: 6.5%, +0.2 ppt

\- Net Debt: $31.2m, –27%

**Future outlook and catalysts:** Mader remains optimistic about continued growth. The company has provided FY2025 guidance for at least $870m revenue and $57m NPAT, representing roughly 12% growth on FY24. Management has articulated a five-year strategic plan (FY22–FY26) emphasising diversification by service line, geography and industry. By the final year, FY2026, Mader aims to surpass $1 billion in revenue.

One major growth catalyst is the ongoing demand in core mining markets: miners prioritise productivity and output, which supports outsourcing maintenance to partners like Mader. Another catalyst is North American expansion – after a period of consolidation in 2024, Mader’s North American segment has returned to headcount growth and is set to benefit from improving commodity prices and a large addressable market. The company re-established an operating presence in Africa.

**Competitors**

Mader Group operates in a competitive mining services landscape, facing a range of rivals from small local contractors to large multinational firms. Key competitors can be grouped into a few categories:

Equipment OEM service teams: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like Caterpillar (via dealers such as WesTrac in Australia) and Komatsu provide machine maintenance services.

Labour hire and maintenance contractors: Several other contractors specialise in providing tradespeople and maintenance services to mines. This includes large mining contractors like Perenti Global (ASX: PRN) and Monadelphous Group (ASX: MND).

**Share Price**

Mader Group’s share price has delivered outstanding returns since listing, although with some volatility. The company IPO’d in September 2019 at $1.00 per share and trades above $6.00, reaching $7.50 in 2023. It hasn’t been all smooth sailing; shortly after listing, the stock dipped below the IPO price during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash.

As commodity markets recovered, Mader’s shares climbed steadily through 2021 and 2022, then accelerated.



**Conclusion**

Strengths

Financials - Strong track record of revenue and profit growth and solid cash generation. Scaleable, asset-light business model with high returns on capital (ROE: &gt;28%)

Customer Base- A top-tier customer base, including BHP, Fortescue, and Rio Tinto, instils credibility.

Tight Ownership - Over 70% of the company is held by insiders

Operational Flexibility - Can respond quickly to changing demand in a historically cyclical sector.

Strong Reputation - A reputation for providing a high-quality service, emphasising employee culture and safety.

Risks &amp; Weakness

Exposure to Mining Cycle - If commodity prices plunge or miners cut spending, maintenance service providers can see reduced workloads.

Low Barrier to Entry - Highly competitive and can face pricing pressure from small and large competitors.

Insourcing - Mining companies might hire maintenance staff internally instead of outsourcing, which could affect Mader’s business.

Weak MOAT - The nature of mining services is that contracts can often be short-term or at the client's discretion. Low switching cost for a client to change maintenance contractors

Mader Group presents a mix of high growth and solid operations, with clear pros (market leader in a necessary service, global growth runway, strong finances) and cons (commodity exposure, competitive pressures, limited inherent moat). The company’s ability to navigate the mining cycle and continue its global expansion will determine whether it can sustain its impressive track record. If it does, Mader could increasingly be considered a standout mid-cap industrial. Any slip in execution could quickly erode its advantages. For now, Mader’s strategy of focusing on what it does best – keeping the world’s mines running – appears sound, and industry perception is that while its economic moat may be narrow, its operational excellence effectively serves as its moat in practice.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.720618,2025-03-31T19:18:23,Rio Tinto,2025

News: Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal

  
SMCI- Hit that $1000, broke it, then utterly collapsed. I was out of town Friday, but this was probably the best trade of the year. Worth watching for any additional moves down, but other than that I’m going to be hands-off.

  
NVDA- Failed to break that $750 that I was interested in (highest we got was $745), and sold off at the open. For me, this is a hands-off until the earnings report. Looks like the semis/AI run-up might be over unless they report a blow-out earnings.

  
DFS- Capital One confirms that they are going to acquire DFS in all-stock transaction ($35.3B)

  
RAPT- Clinical hold placed on their asthma drug, stock is down 63% from the open. Worth watching to see if we break that $10 level for a multi-day swing trade. 

  
SSRM- Reports that employees are being charged due to mine collapse in Turkey (this happened last week). Would keep on watchlist because this doesn’t seem like something that is going to be resolved within a day (like PCG, the Hawaii fires, Rio Tinto, etc).

Historical Influence &amp; Financial Networks**

**Key Points**:

- **War Financing**: Historically funded European wars (e.g., Napoleonic Wars, WWI/WWII), establishing bonds as debt instruments. While not unique, their role in war debt created long-term dependencies between states and their financial apparatus.
- **Central Banking**: Indirect influence via advising institutions like the Bank of England and structuring bond markets. No direct ownership, but historical advisory roles enabled systemic leverage.
- **Gold &amp; Commodities**: Controlled the London Gold Fixing until 2004, influencing global gold pricing. Current stakes in Rio Tinto and Glencore suggest ongoing commodity market influence.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Opaque Financial Flows**: Historic use of offshore entities (e.g., Rothschild Continuation Holdings in Switzerland) raises questions about tax avoidance and capital movement.
- **Resource Control**: Mining/energy investments (e.g., Shell, BP) align with strategic geopolitical resources, potentially enabling supply-chain manipulation.

---

### **2\. Modern Corporate &amp; Policy Affiliations**

**Key Entities**:

- **Rothschild &amp; Co**: Global M&amp;A advisory, restructuring sovereign debt (e.g., Greece, Argentina). Current leadership under Alexandre de Rothschild.
- **Edmond de Rothschild Group**: Manages $100B+ in assets, with private banking ties to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and governments.
- **Corporate Board Roles**:

- **De Beers** (diamonds): Influence over conflict mineral markets.
- **Groupe Casino** (retail): Access to consumer data and emerging markets.
- **Bilderberg Group/CFR**: Elite policy access, shaping globalization agendas.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Revolving Door**: Former Rothschild employees in government roles (e.g., Emmanuel Macron) suggest bidirectional influence.
- **Media Soft Power**: Historic ties to Reuters/Thomson Reuters; current philanthropic ventures (e.g., Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah) may legitimize geopolitical agendas.

---

### **3\. Geopolitical Strategies &amp; Conflicts of Interest**

**Case Studies**:

- **Post-Soviet Privatization**: Advised Russian oligarchs and governments in the 1990s, profiting from undervalued asset sales.
- **EU Austerity Policies**: Rothschild &amp; Co’s role in Greek debt restructuring prioritized creditor returns over public welfare.
- **UK Utilities Privatization**: Advised Thatcher-era sell-offs, securing fees while shaping regulatory frameworks.

**Red Flags**:

- **Dual Advisory Roles**: Simultaneously advising governments and private entities (e.g., advising France on energy policy while holding Shell stakes).
- **Tax Minimization Schemes**: 2015 Spanish indictment of David de Rothschild highlights risks of exploitative financial instruments.

---

### **4\. Philanthropy as Soft Power**

**Initiatives**:

- **World Jewish Congress**: David de Rothschild’s presidency amplifies influence over diaspora politics and Israel relations.
- **Environmental Ventures**: David’s “Plastiki” project and climate philanthropy align with ESG trends, potentially greenwashing resource-extractive investments.

**Intelligence Concerns**:

- **Legitimization of Agendas**: Philanthropy may mask resource-driven investments (e.g., green energy projects tied to Rothschild-backed mining).

---

### **5\. Mitigation Recommendations**

- **Transparency Mandates**: Scrutinize Rothschild-linked offshore holdings and lobbying efforts (e.g., EU/UN registries).
- **Conflict Audits**: Require disclosure of dual advisory roles in sovereign debt/privatization deals.
- **Monitor Policy Groups**: Track Rothschild participation in Bilderberg/CFR to map influence on trade/regulatory policies.

---

### **Structured For Influence**

The Rothschilds’ geopolitical influence stems from **structural access**, leveraging historic financial networks, corporate affiliations, and elite policy channels. Intelligence risks include:

- **Resource monopolization** via commodity investments.
- **Conflicts in sovereign advising** (profit vs. public interest).
- **Soft power through philanthropy/media**.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.720677,2025-03-19T05:54:09,Rio Tinto,2025

***Trump's EV order not seen slowing critical metals demand***

***Global EV demand on the rise, especially in China***

***Lithium industry executives bullish on growth prospects***

Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of electric vehicle targets may temporarily slow demand for lithium and other critical minerals, but is unlikely to hamper the mining industry amid surging global EV demand, analysts and industry leaders said.

Trump on Tuesday revoked predecessor Joe Biden's 2021 executive order that sought to ensure half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 are electric. Automakers had been positioning for a jump in EV demand due largely to that Biden move.

Trump's order [caused shares](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/asian-car-battery-makers-hit-trump-gets-work-2025-01-21/) of Japanese automakers, South Korean battery makers and Australian, U.S. and Chinese lithium miners to slip. But even if EV demand cools in the world's second-biggest auto market, analysts and industry experts expect traction elsewhere to more than compensate. Trump has [planned other regulatory changes](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-transition-team-aims-kill-biden-ev-tax-credit-2024-11-14/) to cut off support for EVs and charging stations. He also aims to strengthen measures b[locking imports](https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-that-might-be-affected-by-trumps-promised-tariffs-2024-11-26/) of automobiles and battery materials from China.

""Every time people take away subsidies or benefits ... it's a dent to the demand scenario,"" said analyst Glyn Lawcock at Barrenjoey, an Australian investment bank. ""(But) ultimately demand will still grow even if the U.S. is a bit slower under Trump."" Australian lithium producer Liontown Resources [(LTR.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LTR.AX) said the global transition to EVs was underway, with or without the United States."" Longer term, I just don't think it will be an issue on demand,"" Antonino Ottaviano, Liontown's CEO, said on a Tuesday analyst call.

  
Much of the EV industry's growth happens in China, accounting for 11 million sales or 65% of the market, compared with North America, which accounts for 20% of the market, Liontown executives said on the call. Meanwhile, the rest of the world already accounts for 1.3 million EV sales and is growing at 27% year on year, a trajectory that will see it become more meaningful than the entire North American market in less than two years, the Liontown executives added.

That growth potential is something Chinese EV manufacturers are chasing given they are locked out of the U.S. market due to [100% EV tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-locks-steep-china-tariff-hikes-many-start-sept-27-2024-09-13/) imposed by Biden. Grid-scale batteries that store days' worth of electricity are rising in popularity across the world, for example. Critical metals are also used to build many consumer electronics as well as computer servers needed to [power the artificial intelligence industry](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/critical-metals-will-be-key-battleground-us-china-trade-war-andy-home-2024-12-17/).Albemarle [(ALB.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ALB.N), the world's largest lithium company, declined to comment on Trump's order.

Rio Tinto also declined to comment on Trump's order, but its CEO Jakob Stausholm told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that he is bullish on the white metal.""Lithium demand will probably go up another five times over the next 15 years, so a lot more lithium projects will have to be built,"" Stausholm told the forum in Davos, Switzerland, adding that he has owned an EV for more than nine years.""It's just a better car"" than an internal combustion engine, Stausholm added.David Klanecky, CEO of privately held battery recycler Cirba Solutions, expects U.S. demand for critical minerals to jump by 2030 due to the demand not just for EVs, but for myriad electronics .Beyond any target rollbacks, miners said they believe [measures to wean ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/)Western manufacturers off Chinese supplies will underpin support for their metals.""We expect measures taken to build supply chain independence from China ... to have a much greater impact than the rollback of a formal target for EV sales,"" said Darryl Cuzzubbo, CEO of Australian rare earths developer Arafura [(ARU.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ARU.AX).

[Declaring a National Energy Emergency – The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/)

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*) (“NEA”), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1.  Purpose*.*  The energy and critical minerals (“energy”) identification, leasing, development, production, transportation, refining, and generation capacity of the United States are all far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.  We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation’s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.  Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes.

This active threat to the American people from high energy prices is exacerbated by our Nation’s diminished capacity to insulate itself from hostile foreign actors.  Energy security is an increasingly crucial theater of global competition.  In an effort to harm the American people, hostile state and non-state foreign actors have targeted our domestic energy infrastructure, weaponized our reliance on foreign energy, and abused their ability to cause dramatic swings within international commodity markets.  An affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy is a fundamental requirement for the national and economic security of any nation.

The integrity and expansion of our Nation’s energy infrastructure —- from coast to coast -— is an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States’ national and economic security.  It is imperative that the Federal government puts the physical and economic wellbeing of the American people first.

Moreover, the United States has the potential to use its unrealized energy resources domestically, and to sell to international allies and partners a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy.  This would create jobs and economic prosperity for Americans forgotten in the present economy, improve the United States’ trade balance, help our country compete with hostile foreign powers, strengthen relations with allies and partners, and support international peace and security.  Accordingly, our Nation’s dangerous energy situation inflicts unnecessary and perilous constraints on our foreign policy.

The policies of the previous administration have driven our Nation into a national emergency, where a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid, require swift and decisive action.  Without immediate remedy, this situation will dramatically deteriorate in the near future due to a high demand for energy and natural resources to power the next generation of technology.  The United States’ ability to remain at the forefront of technological innovation depends on a reliable supply of energy and the integrity of our Nation’s electrical grid.  Our Nation’s current inadequate development of domestic energy resources leaves us vulnerable to hostile foreign actors and poses an imminent and growing threat to the United States’ prosperity and national security.

These numerous problems are most pronounced in our Nation’s Northeast and West Coast, where dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United States population.  The United States’ insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nation’s economy, national security, and foreign policy.  In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency.

Sec. 2. Emergency Approvals*.*  (a)  The heads of executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) shall identify and exercise any lawful emergency authorities available to them, as well as all other lawful authorities they may possess, to facilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.  If an agency assesses that use of either Federal eminent domain authorities or authorities afforded under the Defense Production Act (Public Law 81-774, 50 U.S.C. 4501 *et seq*.) are necessary to achieve this objective, the agency shall submit recommendations for a course of action to the President, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.

(b)  Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4)(C)(ii)(III), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, after consultation with, and concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, shall consider issuing emergency fuel waivers to allow the year-round sale of E15 gasoline to meet any projected temporary shortfalls in the supply of gasoline across the Nation.

Sec. 3. Expediting the Delivery of Energy Infrastructure*.*  (a)   To facilitate the Nation’s energy supply, agencies shall identify and use all relevant lawful emergency and other authorities available to them to expedite the completion of all authorized and appropriated infrastructure, energy, environmental, and natural resources projects that are within the identified authority of each of the Secretaries to perform or to advance.

(b)  To protect the collective national and economic security of the United States, agencies shall identify and use all lawful emergency or other authorities available to them to facilitate the supply, refining, and transportation of energy in and through the West Coast of the United States, Northeast of the United States, and Alaska.

(c)  The Secretaries shall provide such reports regarding activities under this section as may be requested by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

Sec. 4.  Emergency Regulations and Nationwide Permits Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Other Statutes Administered by the Army Corps of Engineers*.*  (a)  Within 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies, as well as the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works shall:

(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to emergency treatment pursuant to the regulations and nationwide permits promulgated by the Corps, or jointly by the Corps and EPA, pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of March 3, 1899, 33 U.S.C. 403, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1413 (collectively, the “emergency Army Corps permitting provisions”); and

(ii)  shall provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”); the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  Such [report]() may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the fullest extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.

(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, each department and agency shall provide a status report to the OMB Director; the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; the Director of the National Economic Council; and the Chairman of the CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within subsection (a)(i) of this section, shall list the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and shall list any new planned or potential actions that fall within subsection (a)(i).  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(d)  The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, shall be available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the emergency Army Corps permitting provisions.  The Administrator of the EPA shall provide prompt cooperation to the Secretary of the Army and to agencies in connection with the discharge of the responsibilities described in this section.

Sec. 5*.* Endangered Species Act (ESA) Emergency Consultation Regulations*.*  (a)  No later than 30 days from the date of this order, the heads of all agencies tasked in this order shall:

(i)   identify planned or potential actions to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply that may be subject to the regulation on consultations in emergencies, 50 C.F.R. 402.05, promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; and

(ii)  provide a summary report, listing such actions, to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ.  Such report may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.

(b)  Agencies are directed to use, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, the ESA regulation on consultations in emergencies, to facilitate the Nation’s energy supply.

(c)  Within 30 days following the submission of the initial summary report described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the head of each agency shall provide a status report to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, the OMB Director, the Director of the National Economic Council, and the Chairman of CEQ. Each such report shall list actions taken within the categories described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, the status of any previously reported planned or potential actions, and any new planned or potential actions within these categories.  Such status reports shall thereafter be provided to these officials at least every 30 days for the duration of the national emergency and may be combined, as appropriate, with any other reports required by this order.  The OMB Director may grant discretionary exemptions from this reporting requirement.

(d)  The Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Director’s authorized representative, is available to consult promptly with agencies and to take other prompt and appropriate action concerning the application of the ESA’s emergency regulations.  The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries for the National Marine Fisheries Service, or the Assistant Administrator’s authorized representative, is available for such consultation and to take such other action.

Sec. 6. Convening the Endangered Species Act Committee.  (a)  In acting as Chairman of the Endangered Species Act Committee, the Secretary of the Interior shall convene the Endangered Species Act Committee not less than quarterly, unless otherwise required by law, to review and consider any lawful applications submitted by an agency, the Governor of a State, or any applicant for a permit or license who submits for exemption from obligations imposed by Section 7 of the ESA.

(b)  To the extent practicable under the law, the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure a prompt and efficient review of all submissions described in subsection (a) of this section, to include identification of any legal deficiencies, in order to ensure an initial determination within 20 days of receipt and the ability to convene the Endangered Species Act Committee to resolve the submission within 140 days of such initial determination of eligibility.

(c)  In the event that the committee has no pending applications for review, the committee or its designees shall nonetheless convene to identify obstacles to domestic energy infrastructure specifically deriving from implementation of the ESA or the Marine Mammal Protection Act, to include regulatory reform efforts, species listings, and other related matters with the aim of developing procedural, regulatory, and interagency improvements.

Sec. 7. Coordinated Infrastructure Assistance*.*  (a)  In collaboration with the Secretaries of Interior and Energy, the Secretary of Defense shall conduct an assessment of the Department of Defense’s ability to acquire and transport the energy, electricity, or fuels needed to protect the homeland and to conduct operations abroad, and, within 60 days, shall submit this assessment to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.  This assessment shall identify specific vulnerabilities, including, but not limited to, potentially insufficient transportation and refining infrastructure across the Nation, with a focus on such vulnerabilities within the Northeast and West Coast regions of the United States.  The assessment shall also identify and recommend the requisite authorities and resources to remedy such vulnerabilities, consistent with applicable law.

(b)  In accordance with section 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1631), the construction authority provided in section 2808 of title 10, United States Code, is invoked and made available, according to its terms, to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, to address any vulnerabilities identified in the assessment mandated by subsection (a).  Any such recommended actions shall be submitted to the President for review, through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.

Sec. 8*.*  Definitions*.*  For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:

(a)  The term “energy” or “energy resources” means crude oil, natural gas, lease condensates, natural gas liquids, refined petroleum products, uranium, coal, biofuels, geothermal heat, the kinetic movement of flowing water, and critical minerals, as defined by 30 U.S.C. 1606 (a)(3).

The first [Quadrennial Supply Chain review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20212024-Quadrennial-Supply-Chain-Review.pdf) details supply chains critical for national and economic security, including the U.S. Geological Survey’s accomplishments [mapping ](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/earth-mri)potential new sources of critical minerals in the U.S., compiling the whole of government [List of Critical Minerals](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals), and tracking global markets and supplies of critical minerals. 

“The U.S. Geological Survey is providing practical, pragmatic science to understand U.S. reliance on foreign sources of critical minerals needed for industry, technology and national defense, and better map the geology of the nation to locate secure critical mineral sources at home.  Funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has helped us accomplish the work set out by the Energy Act of 2020,” said Dave Applegate, Director of the USGS. 

From the White House [fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-progress-strengthening-americas-supply-chains/): 

* Mapping America’s critical minerals deposits. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is announcing new airborne geophysical mapping in the Ozark Plateau (Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas) and Alaska over areas known to host minerals such as antimony, tin, tungsten, and lead and zinc ores, as well as byproduct critical minerals such as gallium and germanium. USGS’s mapping work, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), is revolutionizing the U.S. Government’s understanding of the nation’s mineral and geologic resources. USGS and NASA are partnering to complete [the largest high-quality hyperspectral survey in the world](https://www.usgs.gov/news/featured-story/seeing-earth-a-new-light-how-earth-mri-data-deepening-our-understanding), surveying more than 180,000 square miles of the Southwest with sensors that make it possible to “see” nuanced differences between materials. 

* ***Updating the U.S.’s critical minerals market data. Next month, USGS will publish its 2025 Mineral Commodity Summaries.*** [***These annual reports***](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/mineral-commodity-summaries-us-overview) ***help forecast supply chain disruptions resulting from a variety of risks including pandemics, natural disasters, and trade wars, and are the U.S.’s authoritative source of data on the supply, demand, and consumption of 100 mineral commodities. Additionally, last month, researchers at the USGS National Minerals Information Center developed a*** [***new model to assess how disruptions of critical mineral supplies***](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-critical-minerals-study-bans-gallium-and-germanium-exports-could) ***may affect the U.S. economy.

Copperstone Mine Development Plans and New Team Additions

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 6, 2025) - Minera Alamos Inc. (TSXV: MAI) **(the ""Company"" or ""Minera Alamos"")** and Sabre Gold Mines Corp. **(""Sabre"")** (TSX: SGLD; OTCQB: SGLDF) are pleased to announce the closing of the previously announced acquisition by Minera Alamos of Sabre and its flagship Copperstone gold project (*see news release dated October 28****th****, 2024*) (the ""**Transaction**"").

* **Creation of a Diversified North American Gold Producer Platform** \- Beyond the Santana gold mine operations (Sonora, Mexico), the addition of Copperstone (Arizona, US) helps provide visibility to a further 150koz of annual gold production in premier mining jurisdictions in North America
* **Acquisition of Past Producing Copperstone Mine** \- Sabre's flagship asset produced a total of 514,000 oz of gold from 1987 to 1993. Along with existing infrastructure, the project contains significant additional resource ounces and is at advanced stage permitting for a near-term mine restart
* **Accelerating Copperstone Back into Production** \- Minera Alamos' in-house mine-building expertise combined with Minera Alamos's previously acquired process plant equipment will allow for significant reductions in restart time of the Copperstone mine in this very strong gold price environment

""We are excited to have closed the Sabre Transaction that provides a new development platform for our shareholders in a stable jurisdiction. The Copperstone mine provides excellent leverage to gold prices and is in keeping with our other assets in that it has robust economics at much lower and more conservative gold price scenarios."" stated Doug Ramshaw, President of Minera Alamos. ""Even in advance of the acquisition closing we have had discussions with various project financing groups with regard to advancing Copperstone. With a shift toward more positive sentiment on the outlook for the Mexican mining industry in 2025, this year is expected to be a very active one for the Company and we are preparing for overlapping project development work in both Mexico and Arizona.""

**Team**

Minera Alamos is pleased to have added Louell Uy to our mining planning group. Louell has been an independent consultant for the last 6 years, following his work with both Teck and Rio Tinto between 2008 and 2017 in various capacities that largely centred around mine planning engineering which will be leaned on heavily both at Santana and Cerro de Oro in Mexico as well as at the newly acquired Copperstone mine.

In addition, Minera Alamos has begun the process of adding team members that will be exclusively focused on the Copperstone project. Garth Wilcox will be providing additional engineering, design and construction support services as the project lead for Consultec Group. Garth previously worked with the Minera Alamos team during the successful build out of the El Castillo gold mine under the Castle Gold banner in 2008-2011.

**Mill Components Relocation**

Minera Alamos is currently reviewing transportation proposals for the movement of the processing plant (mill) equipment that is currently in storage in Val d'Or, Quebec down to the Copperstone site. A full schedule for the move is expected to be finalized later this quarter.

**Preliminary Economic Assessment (""PEA"") Update**

As part of the requirements of the Securities Authorities, the previous PEA Report commissioned for Sabre titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report: Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Copperstone Project, La Paz County, Arizona, USA"" by Hard Rock Consulting LLC and with an effective date of June 26, 2023, will be re-issued in Minera Alamos's name. This is expected to be filed in February 2025 and will take into account the reduced royalty load as a result of Sabre extinguishing a 1.5% NSR on the property (*see Sabre news release dated November 11\*\*th* *2024*) and also highlight gold price sensitivity beyond the original report as a result of the movement in gold prices since it was first published.

**Stock Option Grant**

Minera Alamos has also granted 6,200,000 incentive options to new and existing employees, management, directors and consultants of the Company with an exercise price of $0.33 and a term of 5 years. In addition, 800,000 options with an exercise price of $0.60 and a term of 5 years were granted to Doug Ramshaw, President of the Company. All options vest immediately.

**Transaction Details**

Pursuant to the Transaction, each issued and outstanding common share of Sabre (the ""**Sabre Shares**""), including each Sabre Share issued in connection with the Debt Settlement (defined below), was acquired and exchanged for 0.693 of a Minera Alamos common share (the ""**Minera Alamos Shares**""), resulting in the issuance of 76,499,114 Minera Alamos Shares. Prior to closing, certain related party creditors of Sabre (the ""**Creditors**"") agreed to settle approximately CAD$9.5 million in principal and interest in exchange for an aggregate of 30,490,883 Sabre Shares (the ""**Debt Settlement**""). For further details see our press release dated October 28, 2024.

In addition, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,546,775 options to acquire Minera Alamos Shares (""**Minera Options**"") in exchange for the issued and outstanding options to acquire Sabre Shares. The Minera Options have exercise prices ranging from $0.26 to $2.02 per Minera Alamos Share.

Upon completion of the Transaction (including the Debt Settlement), existing Minera Alamos and Sabre shareholders will own approximately 86% and 14% of Minera Alamos, respectively.

As a condition of closing, Sabre also amended its existing gold purchase and sale agreement with Star Royalties Ltd. (the ""**GPSA**"") and in connection therewith Minera Alamos has agreed to grant to Star Royalties Ltd. (""**Star Royalties**"") security over the Sabre Shares post-closing, being consistent with the terms of the security which Star Royalties held prior to closing. Pursuant to the GPSA, Star Royalties already held security interests over substantially all of Sabre's assets, which will continue post-closing.

The Sabre Shares are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX"") as of the close of trading on or around February 7, 2025. Minera Alamos will now apply for Sabre to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws.

Information regarding the procedure for exchange of Sabre Shares for Minera Alamos Shares is provided in Sabre's management information circular dated December 3, 2024, related to the Sabre special meeting (the ""**Circular**""). The Circular and accompanying letter of transmittal are available under Sabre's profile at [www.sedarplus.ca](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/BpwP7UYnz3).

The listing of the issued Minera Shares remains subject to the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.

**Settlement on Financial Advisory fees**

Minera Alamos further announces that it has agreed to settle a payable (debt) with an arms length party (who was engaged by Sabre as financial advisor on the Transaction) in the amount of $858,000 by the issuance of 3,118,800 common shares of the Company at a deemed price of $0.28 per share. The shares issuable in connection with this debt settlement shall be subject to receipt of approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and will be subject to a statutory hold period expiring four months and one day after issuance.

**Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information**

This news release includes certain ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. All information herein, other than information of historical fact, constitutes forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is frequently, but not always, identified by words such as ""expects"", ""anticipates"", ""believes"", ""intends"", ""estimates"", ""potential"", ""possible"", and similar expressions, or statements that events, conditions, or results ""will"", ""may"", ""could"", or ""should"" occur or be achieved. This information is based on information currently available to Minera Alamos and Minera Alamos provides no assurance that actual results will meet management's expectations. Forward-looking information in this news release includes, but is not limited to, the delisting of the Sabre Shares from the TSX; the application for Sabre Gold to cease to be a reporting issuer in relevant jurisdictions; the successful settlement of the financial advisory fee by issue of Minera Alamos Shares; statements concerning future exploration plans at the Company's mineral projects; the Company's proposed business strategy; and the development and condition of the Company's mining assets. The forward-looking information is based on assumptions and addresses future events and conditions that, by their very nature involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results relating to, among other things, results of exploration, the economics of processing methods, project development, reclamation and capital costs of Minera Alamos' mineral properties, and the ability to complete a preliminary economic assessment which supports the technical and economic viability of mineral production could differ materially from those currently anticipated in forward-looking information for many reasons. Minera Alamos' financial condition and prospects could differ materially from those currently anticipated in forward-looking information for many reasons such as: an inability to finance and/or complete an updated resource and reserve estimate and a preliminary economic assessment which supports the technical and economic viability of mineral production; changes in general economic conditions and conditions in the financial markets; changes in demand and prices for minerals; litigation, legislative, environmental and other judicial, regulatory, political and competitive developments; technological and operational difficulties encountered in connection with Minera Alamos' activities; and other matters discussed in this news release and in filings made with securities regulators. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of Minera Alamos' forward-looking information. These and other factors should be considered carefully, and readers should not place undue reliance on Minera Alamos' forward-looking information. Minera Alamos does not undertake to update any forward-looking information that may be made from time to time by Minera Alamos or on its behalf, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.

The Company does not have a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability for the Santana project, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, including increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure.

NEITHER TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION SERVICES PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.

**Summary**

Blackstone Minerals (BSX) is focused on building a vertically integrated processing business in Vietnam that produces ‘Green’ Nickel: Cobalt: Manganese (NCM) Precursor products for Asia’s growing Lithium-ion battery industry. Blackstone’s upstream component involves mining Nickel sulphide deposits from a mixture of open pit and underground mines and processing this mined ore to produce a concentrate that, in combination with third party supplied concentrates, can be upgraded and refined into Class 1 Nickel products suitable for use in Lithium-ion Batteries (i.e., NCM811 Precursor) via Blackstone’s downstream refinery component.

Blackstone’s second project is their 100% owned [Gold Bridge project](https://www.blackstoneminerals.com.au/gold-bridge-project) which includes a 367 km² tenement in British Columbia, Canada. [Initial drilling in November](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02459681.pdf) intersected significant Copper, Nickel and Cobalt with assay results expected within the **next 4-5 weeks.**

**Upstream Business Unit (UBU)**

Blackstone's UBU consists of its 90% owned [Ta Khoa Project](https://www.blackstoneminerals.com.au/ta-khoa-project) which is located within a premier nickel sulphide district 160km West of Hanoi, in the north-west of Vietnam and consists of both massive sulphide vein (MSV) and disseminated sulphide (DSS) targets offering a **9+ year resource life**, as well as the Ban Phuc Nickel mine. The Ban Phuc Mine, which includes a **450ktpa Nickel processing plant built to Australian Standards**, operated from 2013 to 2016 before being shut down due to a decline in Nickel price. Blackstone recently [recommissioned the concentrator and restarted mining activity ](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02464587.pdf)to produce two batches of concentrate for use in the Ta Khao Refinery piloting programs.

The Ta Khoa project/district, which consists of approx **25 massive sulphide veins and disseminated sulphide deposits within a 5km radius of the Ban Phuc concentrator**, [was recently announced to has grown by 73% ](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02470724.pdf)and currently sits at a Combined Mineral Resource of **130 Mt at 0.37% Ni for 485kt of nickel** (**0.44% NiEQ for 571kt Nickel Equivalent**).

Drilling is continuing on upwards of 5 additional targets which are expected to again add to the inferred resource. Blackstone is [also working closely with the Vietnamese Government](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02431127.pdf) to identify new targets, most notably the nearby Chim Van massive sulphide deposit. Historical sampling has shown up to **1.13% nickel and 0.37% copper** and initial exploration suggests that this deposit could be up to **10-12x the size of the existing deposits.**

Ore from the above resources are to be used as base load supply for a 8Mtpa concentrator being examined in the **Upstream Pre-feasibility Study (PFS) to be completed early in 2022.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Downstream Business Unit (DBU)**

Blackstone's downstream strategy is to develop an integrated processing facility, including a **400kt/pa refinery (with the possibility to upgrade to 800kt/pa)**, to convert nickel concentrate from its Ta Khoa operation (UBU) and third party sources into battery ready precursor material. The refinery will be modular and scalable and will allow Blackstone to blend different feedstocks to optimise operational and cost performances to capture significant premiums on the sale of NCM precursor products as well as deliver different ratios of NCM mixes to suit each manufacturer's requirements.

The Ta Khoa Refinery is a margin-based business with lower leverage to nickel metal prices as compared to a mining operation.

Blackstone has [signed an MoU](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02180711.pdf) with **EcoPro**, **Korea's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery cathode manufacturer** to **work in partnership to develop the downstream facility**. As part of this, EcoPro has [invested $6.8m for a 15%](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02222938.pdf) stake (now 9% due to SPP dilution) in Blackstone. This was at a **60% premium of the share price at the time**. EcoPro now also has one member on Blackstone’s board. EcoPro recently announced that they [secured a three-year deal worth ($8.5 billion)](https://www.ajudaily.com/view/20210909101656435) to **supply key materials for SK Innovation's high-nickel batteries**. EcoPro will **provide high-nickel NCM cathode materials to SK Innovation for three years from 2024**.

Blackstone has [**signed an MoU with Trafigura**](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02332733.pdf), who are **one of the world’s leading physical commodities traders** for copper, zinc, lead, **nickel &amp; cobalt**, to secure additional feed products for its downstream facility.  Blackstone has also purchased approx. [**7% equity of Flying Nickel’s Minago project in Canada**](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02455166.pdf). Initial metallurgical test work has demonstrated that Minago is able to produce one-of the **highest nickel concentrate grades in the world** (**&gt;20%**) **using conventional technology.**

This week, Blackstone has also purchased approx. [15% equity of NICO’s Aust based](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02476553.pdf), Central Musgrave project which is considered one of the **largest, undeveloped Nickel projects in the world** and (according to management) has been of keen interest to battery manufacturers such as **POSCO and Samsung.** NICO resourced IPO’d on the ASX this week under ticker NC1.

The downstream component will also be able to produce Mixed Hydroxide Precipitation (MHP) (the intermediate product) to be sold to other refineries. Additionally, the downstream facility will also produce copper by-product with [initial results](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02378816.pdf) from downstream processing test work shows **excellent recovery of Palladium, Platinum and Rhodium.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Refinery / Process**

Phase 1 of the pilot plant will be located at the Ban Phuc nickel mine and Phase 2 will likely be in Son La or Phu Tho provinces, with both plants following a hydrometallurgical (POX) process flow sheet which can be broadly broken down into two stages:

1. Production of mixed hydroxide product (MHP) from concentrate; and
2. The production of NMC cathode precursor material from MHP.

BSX has planned two pilot plant phases for completion prior to full commercial production.

* Phase 1 Pilot Plant (PP1) - 20kg/hr Ni Concentrate feed
* Phase 2 Pilot Plant (PP2) - 1,000kg/hr Ni Concentrate feed

Scott has mentioned that this strategy has been adopted after ongoing negotiations with major players in the Lithium-ion battery industry and allows for greater flexibility and economics. He has also mentioned these negotiations are ongoing with regards to the DFS for the downstream component.

Interestingly, Scott has also recently returned from a **trip to South Korea** and a recent video (which has since been deleted - likely due to potentially breaching NDA’s) **showed one of Blackstone’s team mention that Samsung** had been on a site visit.

Blackstone, using Stimulus Engineer’s lab, [successfully produced](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02397939.pdf) its first batch of **&gt;99.7% battery grade Nickel**: Cobalt: Manganese (NCM) 811 Precursor sample mid 2021 using it’s own materials and other third party feed sources.

**DBU PFS Outcomes**

The July 2021 [**pre-feasibility study on Blackstone’s downstream component**](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02398815.pdf) showed some really strong figures, which have only become more attractive given rising Nickel prices.

**Nickel Outlook / Demand**

With the predicted rise in global EV uptake, the demand for key battery materials is predicted to exponentially increase, generating a supply shortage. Given the average lithium-ion battery for an EV contains around **28.9 kilograms of nickel**, **7.7 kilograms of cobalt**, and **5.9 kilograms of lithium**, both battery and car manufacturers are looking to source raw materials.

* The forecast is for a **steady demand for class 1 Nickel** for the next few years which should ensure a steady Nickel price moving forward and avoid price fluctuations.
* Existing Nickel producers are engaging in [bidding wars](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/canadas-noront-goes-with-wyloos-offer-gives-bhp-five-days-match-2021-12-21/) for potential projects and are [investing heavily in new projects outside their usual, safer jurisdictions](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bhp-invest-50-mln-advance-tanzania-nickel-project-2022-01-10/) to guarantee supply.

&amp;#x200B;

[Class 1 Nickel Demand](https://preview.redd.it/gars26ac90d81.jpg?width=1163&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05460b51940473a00520b9e662ae4bd8b0e986a0)

While Tesla are looking to utilise non/low Nickel LFP batteries, Asia (Blackstone’s target market) is **focusing on high nickel cathodes in their batteries:**

* **South Korea's top three electric vehicle battery makers; LG Energy Solution, SK On and Samsung (who supply batteries to BMW and General Motors respectively)**, has begun [**gearing up for full-scale production of next-generation batteries high in nickel content**](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202110170001) in late 2021.
* SK On's next-generation battery NCM9, composed of lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese with **90% nickel content**, **will be used in Ford Motor Co.'s EV pickup set for launch in the spring of 2022**.
* **LG Energy Solution** and **SK On** will this year **begin the production of high-nickel batteries made of nickel**, cobalt, manganese and aluminium (NCMA) and NCM9, respectively.
* Demand for higher Nickel content batteries is set to increase drastically with NCM batteries expected to dominate other Nickel rich chemistries including NCA and LMNO by 2030.

[Growing Nickel Demand and Adoption of High Nickel Batteries](https://preview.redd.it/k34zlsddl0d81.jpg?width=1206&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd9a911b27606f04b0470e7f27a44b1fb05a2080)

**Nickel Price &amp; Its Effect**

* While movement in the spot nickel price will drive a higher NCM811 Precursor price as well as a higher nickel concentrate purchase price, given an **integrated business strategy,** which involves Blackstone using their own Nickel concentrate, increases in Nickel prices will **greatly benefit Blackstone by allowing them to sell their NCM product at an even higher premium** while their **material costs will be minimally affected** \- driving higher margins.
* The PFS refinery design will also enable the production of **multiple products**, including NCM 811 which attracts a **strong premium to metal prices.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategically Located in Asia’s EV Hub**

* Blackstone is conveniently located within an already huge, but growing Lithium-ion battery hub within SE Asia. Additionally, Vietnam itself is a rapidly evolving market for EV’s.
* Blackstone is **very close to the EV &amp; Lithium battery manufacturing hub in Hai Phong** which includes **huge Li-ion** **battery manufacturing plant**s by **LG, Samsung SDI and Vinfast.**

[SE Asia's Battery Hub](https://preview.redd.it/t50lpo08j0d81.jpg?width=1274&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd0f2f0a57b91d60272ce0e984cb4c8195a2ac94)

&amp;#x200B;

**Vietnam &amp; Foreign Investment**

* Vietnam’s GPD has seen consistent growth over the last 30 years and the Vietnamese government is focused on initiatives and policy to support foreign investment which has seen foreign investment increase from \~US$13bn in 2014 to **\~US$20bn in 2019 highlighting confidence in the country's stability and government.**
* The EV industry is rapidly evolving in Vietnam with its home-grown company, VinFast (Vietnam’s largest conglomerate), pivoting from ICE autos to **manufacturing EV’s** and **electric scooters**. Vinfast has set up an auto plant in the port city of Hai Phong from which it plans to export up to **250k vehicles to the US and Europe per year**. Its plans are targeting manufacturing **500k EVs and 500k e-scooters per year.** In 2019, **VinFast and LG established a JV to produce lithium-ion batteries for its electric cars and scooters**.
* The top five foreign investors (by registered capital) into Vietnam include **South Korea**, Hong Kong, Singapore, **Japan** &amp; China

**Infrastructure**

* The Ta Khoa Nickel-Cu-PGE project is located **350km from Hai Phong port** and it is **well connected to both the port and Hanoi via both modern roadways and rail,** allowing for easy and efficient transport.
* Son La Hydropower Plant and Hoa Binh Hydropower plant are nearby and will **offer cheap, reliable and renewable energy** to the project.

[Available Infrastructure](https://preview.redd.it/m9a4xgvyd0d81.jpg?width=1149&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de04b16eb57956aed7b0a4b015886caa6942a439)

&amp;#x200B;

**Green Nickel™**

* Blackstone Minerals has [trademarked the term](https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/2107987?q=Green+Nickel) ‘**Green Nickel**’ as they plan on being a **low emissions supplier of battery materials** by **utilising plentiful and readily available renewable energy.**
* This is beneficial as OEMs are increasingly looking at sourcing only “Green” materials with decent ESG credentials for their supply chains. You can learn more via their [2020 Sustainability Report](https://9042668b-a222-4051-b217-6958cce69db5.filesusr.com/ugd/5d695f_7115413a35ef49c0a3eb4accbc941c1b.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

**Mining Green / Responsibility Sourced Nickel**

* By utilising a Hydrometallurgical (POX) process flow sheet, along with **renewable energy from nearby hydropower plants**, Blackstone will be able to produce both **Nickel concentrate** and **NCM precursor products** at a **much lower carbon intensity** compared to legacy mining methods - reducing the company’s carbon footprint and boosting ESG credentials.

&amp;#x200B;

**Low Labour Cost**

* Vietnam's labour costs are one of the **lowest in the world** which gives BSX a **huge advantage in keeping costs down and margins high.**

[Vietnam's Low Labour Costs Ensure Low OPEX](https://preview.redd.it/n8hvy2maf0d81.jpg?width=569&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8b878a46586d431ca1163b5337486867ea1cb5)

&amp;#x200B;

**Tax Incentives**

* Vietnam, specifically the industrial zone in which Blackstone is looking to set up their downstream facility, offers **attractive corporate tax incentives for early stage businesses, boosting overall economics of the project.**

**Government Engagement**

As well as exploring potential drill targets with the Government, Blackstone is also a part of the **Mining Working Group under the Vietnam Business Forum (VBF)** and through this forum, **can provide input to the Central Government on policies**. Vietnam Business Forum (VBF) is an **on-going policy dialogue channel between the Government of Vietnam** and has been supporting the business community for a favourable business environment since 1997.

&amp;#x200B;

**Funding/Finance**

Blackstone [recently raised $55m](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02445614.pdf) via an oversubscribed SPP to advance phase 2 of it’s pilot Plant Phase 2, PFS for upstream and DFS for downstream as well further drilling and exploration. $5m from shareholders and $50m from soph’s and insto’s. Shares were issued at **5.1% discount to the 10 day VWAP.**

Blackstone is looking to develop and fund (while retaining a significant interest) the construction of the downstream refinery via a mix of:

1. **JV Partners**
2. **Investment Loans**
3. **Equity Raising**
4. **Offtake Prepayment**

Blackstone [recently appointed](https://wcsecure.weblink.com.au/pdf/BSX/02412516.pdf) The Korea Development Bank (KDB) to arrange debt financing for both the upstream and downstream components of its projects. Korea Development Bank (KDB) and BurnVoir Corporate Finance (BurnVoir) will act jointly to secure an attractive, flexible funding package for the development of the Ta Khoa Project.

BurnVoir has **arranged finance for a number of battery metals projects in recent years**, including for **Pilbara Minerals Limited (Pilgangoora Project, lithium)** and A$1.1 billion in debt facilities for IGO’s recent acquisition of an interest in the **Greenbushes Lithium Min**e and the **Kwinana Lithium Hydroxide Refinery**.

A number of different brokers have suggested the company will likely a**dopt a 70:30 mix of debt and equity to fund the project**; however, this is just a vague and general suggestion.

**Upcoming Catalysts / Next Steps**

* Pre-feasibility Study for the Upstream Business Unit is due **‘early 2022’** so could land any moment. With a 74% increase in resource, it's expected this will be received well although could be partially priced in.
* Completion of the Ta Khoa Refinery Definitive Feasibility Study.
* Phased construction of Phase 1 Pilot plant in Vietnam to produce NCM811 Precursor and ensure product meets consumer specification. As per the upstream PFS (July 2021), Balckstone has commenced development of the Phase 1 Pilot Plant and mentioned the recent CR will support this.
* Continued aggressive drilling to increase mineral resources at the Company’s flagship Ta Khoa Nickel Project
* Secure offtake for third party feed material
* Final Investment Decision
* Detailed Engineering and Construction
* NCM811 Precursor production currently targeted in 2024

&amp;#x200B;

**Risks / Concerns:**

* While an integrated approach, including both an upstream and downstream component will bring some serious profit and higher margins, it’s a lot of moving parts and increases the risk of something going wrong.
* LFP batteries, which use little to no Nickel, could be seen as a threat however all SE Asia based manufacturers (who are considered the best and most advanced in the world) have signalled they'll be sticking with NCM batteries for the foreseeable future.
* Overall Nickel grades of their largest deposit (Ban Phuc) while well above cut off, could still be considered low however, as per [this article](https://www.batterymaterialsreview.com/ourblogs/is-it-time-for-lower-grade-nickel-sulphide-projects-to-shine/), which focuses on the economics of lower grade, higher tonnage mines, I think it is still perfectly viable. Other sources will bring the overall grade of the concentrate up. A [report from 2019](https://hotcopper.com.au/attachments/nickelmarketupdatejfbertincourt-pdf.4003149/?filename=NickelMarketUpdateJFBertincourt.pdf) highlighting the benefits of disseminated sulphide projects.
* NICO’s Central Musgrave deposit appears to be mostly laterites which could be harder and more carbon intensive to mine, although, I’m confident Scott wouldn’t have made this purchase without consulting his team who would've ensured it would be suitable and feasible.
* While Vietnam is a considered a pretty stable country, with consistent and steady GDP growth, foreign investment and a number of foreign mining companies running, there is always a small chance their could look to impede on the project.
* COVID. Omicron is fucking shit up globally but Vietnam’s response to COVID has been very good and should be able to see this through.

**Disclaimer:** I currently hold BSX. The above is purely info I've managed to glean from my own research. I haven't crunched any numbers.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&amp;ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&amp;ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

A back of the envelope calculation says it can fund ISRO’s entire budget for almost 2 years. Either that or we can just make the Iron Man 3 movie about 750 times.

# Introduction

A company's vulnerabilities lie in its inability to see clearly. Clarity becomes the number one factor. Managing a business starts with having a clear and concrete view of everything that can be managed, and then taking actions based on expertise. There’s no way to execute at the top level without a clear and comprehensive view of the business! 💡

In this article I will discuss how ontologies help organizations to see clear in mountains of data.

https://preview.redd.it/je97sbncc0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2fea7e61fb03fe8e3bcb4c6142e2e5f94366a8d

# Data-Driven Insights and the Rise of Dashboards in Boardrooms

The reason every organization wanted to work with data was to make their processes visible. The gradual evolution of enterprises becoming data-driven was inspired by the SaaS industry (on-premise first, later on cloud), migrating industries to applications, and enabling them to create and manage data during everyday operations.

All companies now have CRMs and ERPs, often supplemented with best-of-breed (BoB) add-ons like product content management systems and social media data applications.

Data is “the new gold” for one main reason: it provides insights into the enterprise. These insights would otherwise be hidden beneath the complex layers of daily activities integrated into the organization.

oday, it's not just about visuals on dashboards. AI and LLMs now analyze the data through data mining and provide people with solutions, rather than leaving them to do all the thinking work. This is the key reason companies pursue data maturity, striving to become digital-driven organizations that collect and leverage data. But more on that later.

# Example: SaaS and Databases in Logistics

https://preview.redd.it/i6ddy1pjc0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11758b69d55a895a77a25d8cbb86f67b0299743c

A logistics firm managing the incoming fleet of trucks and loading inventory directly into the warehouse. How would the management know where all products are stored and moving to, live, without a digital application?

However, even these methods of business management are becoming “outdated.” It may seem ungrateful or overly critical to say that, but it's true. Enterprises using newer technologies, years ahead of “digitally driven” ones relying on ERPs and CRMs for daily management, are unlocking competitive edges every day. The data-driven organizations that were trumpeted as ""the future of all enterprise"" just a few years ago are now falling behind those adopting newer technologies.

For any organization competing in the business world, every minute is crucial. Market share is being taken away in real-time, as visible on dashboards.

# What Are These New Digital Technologies?

https://preview.redd.it/w3ik34iuc0td1.png?width=420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb552c9b1b7d1ca9a65db70d14583cd402c0ab92

The ontology is a software layer brought to life to “make sense of data.” If big data is the fuel for your car, an ontology is the exterior, interior, and architecture that makes the car drive possible.

In the business world the ontology is [described](https://www.palantir.com/docs/foundry/ontology/why-ontology/) as ""a shared source of truth for decision-making and decision capture across a large organization.""

**Example: Ontology as the Foundation**

Imagine an organization that is already data-driven, collecting data and using it to make day-to-day decisions. They want to understand how a delayed shipment from a port is affecting their sales, marketing, and accounting cycles, and what exact impact these delays will have across the business. Calculating this manually would be impossible. The ontology sees all the existing data and, through its software, makes sense of the impacts if one thing changes, as in this example.

# How an Ontology Works

https://preview.redd.it/w0zf4xhzc0td1.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0177674e7efe702cdbbc0a6d57877ff439b3e96

We, as humans, know the world through our relationship with it. We live in it, computers do not. But how do computers know what “things” in our world are, like partner businesses in the value chain, or “incoming orders,” etc.? Can a computing system ever really “know” anything at all? These are complex questions, but the framework on which an ontology operates is quite simple.

**Conceptual Framework**

https://preview.redd.it/ijd3jgq1d0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dcfa1e31df80506c9d7b9cad102c0affb030dd8

We know things through relationships they have with other things. For example, when flying a plane, gravity pulls it downward, creating resistance, but the engine’s speed generates force, reducing gravity’s effect. These are relationships governed by physical laws. We relate every object, actor, and law in a web of situations and relations.

We also define objects within a conceptual framework of the world, setting clear boundaries on what they are and are not. An ontology can mimic this concept by analyzing data, identifying relationships between data points, and then reasoning through software. Ontologies are fundamentally designed to process and seem to “understand” the world through data.

**Limitations of Compute**

Because a computer holds data in forms of memory, encoded as bits and bytes, real-world “things” are stored as code. The limitations arise from the fact that computers perform millions of calculations, fetching and retrieving these bits based on system architecture. But this doesn't help us understand whether a computer ""knows"" anything.

**Knowledge Through Ontologies**

Ontologies can process real-time data and even tell you if an oil tanker leak, detected through IoT, is impacting quarterly financials and straying your organization from its goals. They can reveal insights faster than human analysis can.

With large amounts of data, software can analyze it, still displaying answers after millions of operations in bits and bytes. But if you ask a computer what 100 sales orders will mean for this quarter’s numbers, it calculates using vast amounts of data and then returns a digitized answer. There’s no “[knowing](https://medium.com/granted/computers-are-dumb-and-what-that-means-for-us-e2bfe42a7e4f)” involved.

# From Data Collection to AI-Driven Insights

https://preview.redd.it/jcmtmsk8d0td1.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbfc43e7f036ca24d66f2377f8c89093d542c059

The first large growth phase from the 2000s to 2020s was data collection. Now, AI and LLMs analyze trillions of data points and “make sense” of it. This evolution is starting today, with ontologies providing LLMs with a framework that helps them “understand” the organization; what it does, who the key players are, and how daily operations work.

Ontologies, in this regard, study “what things in the real world are” and translate that into a digitized software layer. They are not digital twins, which are exact copies of reality in data format, but they give meaning to what things are for digital twins, aiding in the creation of fact-based representations of an enterprise.

# Who Creates Ontologies?

[Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) is currently the only company that creates ontologies driving real-world results. Other data-focused companies attempt to solve problems through better data management, but Palantir’s ontology-based approach goes back 20 years, beginning with government and institutional use. Today, it helps people in governments and enterprises worldwide harness data to drive change.

[Wendy’s](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807171687/en/From-the-Farm-to-the-Frosty®-Palantir-and-Wendy’s-Partner-on-AI-and-Supply-Chain-Digitalization) uses ontology-driven software combined with AI to revolutionize its [supply chain operations](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/wendys-AI-integrate-supply-chain-palantir/723842/). By integrating real-time data from farms all the way to the end product, the system provides visibility into every step of the process. This enables Wendy’s to optimize inventory, reduce waste, and ensure seamless product delivery. The company can now anticipate supply chain disruptions and take proactive steps, allowing for more efficient management and quicker decision-making, all powered by intelligent data processing.

**Rio Tinto: Connecting Workers and Data for Smarter Operations**

In the [mining industry](https://www.palantir.com/newsroom/press-releases/palantir-technologies-and-rio-tinto-sign-multi-year-enterprise-partnership/), [Rio Tinto](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005599/nl/) is harnessing the power of ontologies to connect workers directly with crucial data. With Palantir's platform, real-time insights into underground operations and across the value chain allow workers to see the full scope of mining activities. This not only increases efficiency but also enhances safety and productivity. By giving employees access to data that would otherwise be buried under layers of complexity, Rio Tinto can drive smarter decisions and create a fully integrated digital mining operation.

**BP: Maximizing Oil Output Through Data-Driven Models**

BP uses ontology-based solutions to model and simulate [oil production](https://www.palantir.com/offerings/energy/) scenarios, pushing the boundaries of what traditional operations can achieve. By linking vast data sets with real-time modeling, BP can optimize every aspect of its extraction processes. This data-driven approach enables the company to predict potential outcomes, minimize risks, and ultimately increase output. BP’s reliance on advanced data models transforms raw data into actionable insights, paving the way for more efficient and profitable operations.

Organizations are already benefiting from Palantir's ontology. With the roll-out of [AIP](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/aip/), Palantir's AI solution, enterprises will increasingly integrate ontology-based software throughout their operations, allowing data to be fully understood at every level of the organization.

# Closing Remarks: What the Future Holds for This Technology

I believe every organization will use ontologies in the future, just as cloud solutions replaced pen-and-paper field research, but on a larger scale. As data collection [explodes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) year over year, making sense of it will become increasingly crucial, potentially creating a new category of highly profitable and efficient organizations, those using ontologies, AI, and LLMs for massive real-world impact.

I also think human interaction with systems will decrease, with software reasoning and working autonomously. [Quantum computing](https://www.reddit.com/r/palantir/comments/1fushh5/i_wrote_an_article_discussing_palantirs_role_in/) will further push this shift, where systems might model the world, “knowing” and uploading vast amounts of data from atomic structures to real-world objects into one comprehensive model. Combining quantum systems with ontologies could lead to revolutionary advances in how we understand and impact the world.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:45.721517,2024-10-06T08:51:28,Rio Tinto,2024

I am currently a rising junior at umich majoring in geology and minoring in physics looking for some help with securing an internship for summer 2025. My research is mainly focused on mineral physics and high pressure experimentation, which has left me with a variety of weird laboratory skills. I also plan to finish field camp by the end of this summer. I have a strong interest in exploration in the oil/mining industry.

Since it is my understanding that oil companies do not hire undergraduate interns, I am mainly looking at mining companies like barrick, albermarle, rio tinto, sibayne-stillwater, freeport-mcmoran, newmont, or any other smaller company. Now for some questions:

Is it appropriate to reach out to current employees and ask about the company culture, typical workday, skills needed, etc?

Are AGU/GSA conferences worth to attend for recruitment purposes? 

When does recruitment usually start for mining companies? 

Any other company recommendations besides in the mining industry? (enviro, hydrogeo, gov sector, etc)

Do these programs offer housing during the job? Or is this something I would need to start saving for? (I am willing to relocate)

How many positions do mining companies offer for interns?

Thank you for reading my post, I look forward to reading your comments/suggestions. If anyone is looking for summer interns, or knows of any companies looking, please let me know!

# [Why is there a domestic American critical minerals crisis? - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/why-is-there-a-domestic-american-critical-minerals-crisis/)

https://preview.redd.it/uq3syzdyya7d1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6a420be5d8648b9b907de767f2e5e4a2d66b34b

Why has no one addressed the question: Is there a critical minerals’ supply crisis? And, if so, how did this crisis of critical minerals supply come about? The answer, at least to the second question, is probably because it would expose how greed overtook common sense and how credentials, alone, surpassed any requirements for logical thinking about foreseeable consequences based on openly available data, subject matter knowledge, and experience. More about that later.

First, let’s look at the origins of the (global?) critical minerals’ supply crisis. As with all supply crises, it is a problem of demand exceeding supply. In this case, it is the failure of Western manufacturing to prepare for a rapid rise in demand from China for technology goods and services, and the subsequent (unprecedentedly) rapid build-up, by the Chinese government, of a massive in-country minerals processing capability and capacity to address their own domestic market deficit. This was seen by the Western manufacturing profit-driven managers as an opportunity rather than a competitive threat. But China’s rulers were not seeking profit; they were seeking domestic self-sufficiency and security. China’s rulers creation of a China that was to be completely independent of the rest of the world for minerals sourcing and processing, as well as manufacturing, was the goal, no matter what the short-term cost.  

Since China’s GDP and Gross Domestic Demand for Technology Products have grown simultaneously, since 2000, at a faster rate than that of any other nation in history, the Western manufacturing industry can be excused for “initially” missing the long term effects of such growth on the global consumer markets’ economy. Western governments and their captive economist class have come so late (in understanding the issues) to the party that their recent wild policy swings that threaten the Free Trade agenda put in place after WWII to prevent another resource-seeking world war can be seen as a pathetic lack of understanding of the foreseeable consequences of bad policy.

The critical minerals’ “crisis” is that of the deglobalization of mineral supply chains. In the rapidly vanishing world of global free trade in minerals, they, the minerals, were “refined and processed into end-user-ready forms in the countries where those forms would be used to manufacture consumer and military products. China has created for itself, by aggressive acquisition of ownership or control, almost the entire suite of critical minerals necessary for a self-sufficient high-tech consumer product domestic (as well as export) economy. Simultaneously China built the world’s largest by far metal and mineral processing industry and has probably today also become the world’s largest consumer of and producer of military products in the world. ***China consumes today more than half of all of the metals and industrial minerals produced in the world! And, China processes more than half of the world’s metallic minerals into end-user friendly forms!***

We cannot hope to, nor should we keep pretending that we can completely supplant China for our critical mineral needs both for the military and the civilian markets. We do not have the time, domestic manufacturing expertise, or capital.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has attempted, for its own needs, to establish a total rare earth permanent magnet supply chain, independent of Chinese participation at any level. This attempt has been done through “investments” in companies with little or no track record in that supply chain. The recipients of that largesse have won by simply saying “We can do it” without passing a techno-economic due diligence, because the DoD does not have the internal capability to do one.

The American private (consumer) manufacturing industry has also, so far, failed in its uncorrelated moves to create a secure and sufficient domestic supply of minerals and their processing necessary to free even a small fraction of its needs from Chinese dominance.

The lack of subject matter expertise and the lack of techno-economic due diligence capability and the inability to find them by both the military and the civilian markets is the problem.

[Chinese Premier Li Qiang, left, and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese shake hands during a signing ceremony at Parliament House in Canberra, Monday, June 17, 2024. Li and Albanese and senior ministers of both administrations met at Parliament House on Monday to discuss thorny issues, including lingering trade barriers, conflict between their militaries in international waters and China's desire to invest in critical minerals. \(Lukas Coch\/Pool Photo via AP\)](https://preview.redd.it/075472d6za7d1.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25bfc8b00338d0c513bc8d75cb85b4856bf1dbf0)

  
MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Chinese Premier [Li Qiang](https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-li-qiang-albanese-7d77beb5df26582e2c56ab4cb5fedd1e) has ended his Australian tour on Tuesday in the west coast city of Perth where he has focused on China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links.

Perth is the capital of Western Australia state, which provided 39% of the world's iron ore last year. Iron ore is one of Australia's most lucrative exports. Analysts say the commodity was spared the type of trade bans Beijing imposed on other Australian exports as bilateral relations soured three years ago because the steel-making ingredient was crucial to Chinese industrial growth.

Li last week became the first Chinese premier to visit New Zealand then Australia in seven years. He left Perth late Tuesday for Malaysia, where he'll be China's first premier to visit since 2015.

While in Perth, China’s second-most powerful leader after President Xi Jinping inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.

Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron.”

“I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.

The Perth facility is testing technology on hydrogen, ammonia and batter power for trains, ships, trucks and heavy mining equipment.

Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals. The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.

# Australia shares [U.S. concerns](https://apnews.com/article/biden-china-tariffs-electric-vehicles-evs-solar-2024ba735c47e04a50898a88425c5e2c) over China’s global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector.

Citing Australia’s national interests, Treasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wrote in an opinion piece published in Perth’s main newspaper, The West Australian, on Tuesday that his government was acting to ensure foreign investment “continues to serve our national interests.”

“This includes reforming the foreign investment framework so that it’s more efficient, more transparent and more effective at managing risk,” Albanese wrote.

Forrest said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.

“Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.

Qiang and Albanese flew to Perth in separate planes late Monday from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.

Both leaders attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.

Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two free trading partners.

“While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting.

“It shows that whilst the parameters of a bilateral relationship are set by governments, they will always be sustained by the quality of the personal relationships and especially those personal relationships that subsist on a business-to-business level,” Black added.

Chinese premiers and Australian prime ministers met annually from 2013 until 2019, after which Beijing banned minister-to-minister contacts over the previous conservative government's call for an independent investigation into the causes of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Relations had already been strained by Australian legislation that banned covert foreign interference in Australian politics and the exclusion of Chinese-owned telecommunications giant Huawei from rolling out the national 5G network due to security concerns.

Beijing initiated a reset in relations after Albanese's center-left Labor Party was elected in 2022.

The annual meetings resumed when Albanese visited Beijing in November last year.

Albanese revealed that his office had complained to the Chinese Embassy about the behavior of two officials during a media event with the two leaders after Monday's meeting.

Australia had “concerns” about two Chinese officials who stood in the way of cameras taking images of well-known Australian journalist [Cheng Lei](https://apnews.com/article/australia-china-journalist-cheng-lei-d82400acd9dc977406adc337b724015d) sitting with other reporters as the leaders spoke, Albanese said.

Cheng spent more than three years in detention in China for breaking an embargo with a broadcast on a state-run TV network while she was based in Beijing. She was released last year after interventions by the Australian government and now works for Sky News Australia.

“When you look at the footage, it was a pretty clumsy attempt, frankly, by a couple of people to stand in between where the cameras were and where Cheng Lei was sitting,” Albanese said.

“There should be no impediments to Australian journalists going about their job and we’ve made that clear to the Chinese Embassy,” Albanese added.

Chinese-born Cheng told Sky News on Monday the officials “went to great lengths to block me from the cameras and to flank me.”

“I’m only guessing that it’s to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look. But that in itself was a bad look,” Cheng said.

The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

https://preview.redd.it/tds2y7wy3b7d1.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e3499d33dede4ad2020b54fef2123534ec68737

Federal transportation officials are investigating how titanium sold with phony documentation made its way into parts used in making Boeing and Airbus planes. 

The Federal Aviation Administration and Spirit AeroSystems, a supplier of fuselages to Boeing and wings for Airbus, said Friday they are each investigating the scope and impact of the issue, which could raise potential concerns about aircraft safety. First reported by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/boeing-airbus-titanium-faa.html?ftag=MSFd61514f), the problem came to light after a parts supplier found tiny holes from corrosion in the titanium, according [to](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/boeing-airbus-titanium-faa.html?ftag=MSFd61514f) the newspaper.

""Boeing reported a voluntary disclosure to the FAA regarding procurement of material through a distributor who may have falsified or provided incorrect records,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Boeing issued a bulletin outlining ways suppliers should remain alert to the potential of falsified records.""

Spirit said it is working to determine the origin of the titanium and that it removed the affected parts from the company's production line for testing. 

""This is about titanium that has entered the supply system via documents that have been counterfeited,"" Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said in a statement. ""When this was identified, all suspect parts were quarantined and removed from Spirit production. More than 1,000 tests have been completed to confirm the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the affected material to ensure continued airworthiness.""

  
Planes with parts containing the suspect material were made between 2019 and 2023, and include some Boeing 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner airliners as well as Airbus A220 jets, according to the Times, which cited three people familiar with the matter. An employee at a Chinese company that sold the titanium had forged information on documents certifying the origin of the material, and where it came from remains murky, according the Times' sources.

Boeing said its tests of the materials in question had not yielded any evidence of a problem. The issue affects a small number of parts on Boeing airplanes, according to the aircraft manufacturer. Boeing said it buys most of the titanium it uses in aircraft production directly, and that supply is not impacted. 

""This industrywide issue affects some shipments of titanium received by a limited set of suppliers, and tests performed to date have indicated that the correct titanium alloy was used. To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.""

Airbus said it was aware of the issue and that numerous tests had been performed on parts from the same supplier. ""They show that the A220's airworthiness remains intact,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""The safety and quality of our aircraft are our most important priorities. and we are working in close collaboration with our supplier.""

The development comes after a slew of [safety issues for the aviation industry](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-plan-fix-aircraft-safety-quality-problems/?ftag=MSFd61514f) this year, including [an alarming in-flight incident](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/faa-investigation-boeing-737-max-9-alaska-airlines/?ftag=MSFd61514f) in January in which a door panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines. 

Boeing in April also informed the FAA about another incident involving [potentially falsified inspection records](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-supplier-spirit-aerosystems-whistleblower-speaks-out-quality-issues/?ftag=MSFd61514f) related to the wings of 787 Dreamliner planes, saying it would need to reinspect some planes still in production.

471,lz9jjc,PLTR will moon; hold tight astronauts,farFocalPoint,/r/PLTR/comments/lz9jjc/pltr_will_moon_hold_tight_astronauts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/lz9jjc/pltr_will_moon_hold_tight_astronauts/,93,25,1615060150.0,"I will just tell you why.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, &amp; **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&amp;GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN  to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.  


10) $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after Q4 earnings  


11)  if investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. 

12) It's ok that the some dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.

474,hwbmwx,DD: KDK.V Kodiak Copper Corp,attackpattern100,/r/Baystreetbets/comments/hwbmwx/dd_kdkv_kodiak_copper_corp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baystreetbets/comments/hwbmwx/dd_kdkv_kodiak_copper_corp/,17,38,1595490613.0,"YOOO degens are you tired of chasing popping mining corps with charts that look like raging green dildos, only to have the sp reverse and flatten out after you buy them leaving you wondering whether or not your girlfriend's dad's boyfriend's cousin ever even cared?

Get ahead of the game and take a look at this:

[Kodiak Copper Corp (KDK.V)](https://kodiakcoppercorp.com/)

Kodiak is currently drilling a copper GOLD project in southern BC. WAIT STOP DON'T TUNE OUT

THE PROJECT:

The MPD Copper Gold Deposit: Previously drilled to ONLY 125 metres by Newmont and Rio Tinto over the last 35 years.

From their website ""The MPD Project is located in the Quesnel Trough, British Columbia’s  primary copper-producing belt that hosts Teck Resource’s world-class  Highland Valley Mine, IMPERIAL METALS’ Mount Polley Mine, and Centerra  Gold’s Mount Milligan Mine (see Table 1).  The MPD project’s Nicola Belt  geology has many similar characteristics to the neighbouring alkalic  porphyry systems at the Copper Mountain Mine to the south and New Gold’s  New Afton Mine to the north.""

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;SO THIS IS A GOOD AREA TO DRILL (and nice and close to Van City too)&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

The story gets better.

Chris Taylor saw something under the ontario soil that interested him. His work at IMPERIAL METALS familiarized him with the geology of big deposits. He has gone on to CATAPULT shareholders of GBR from $0-$18 using an approach of drilling non stop and creating an avalanche of hype around his company.

Taylor is EXTREMELY familiar with the area that KDK is in because he cut his teeth at IMPERIAL METALS  which also have a mine in the same area.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;ABOUT CHRIS TAYLOR ATTITUDE TOWARDS SHARE STRUCTURE&gt;      


Most mining corps have 45 trillion shares in the float which is a ton of paper that makes share price moves difficult. Chris taylor understands how to jack up share prices.

here he is explaining his mentality: [https://youtu.be/Kum4NjX6VNs?t=412](https://youtu.be/Kum4NjX6VNs?t=412)

TLDR: KEEP THE SHARE COUNT LOW&lt; DRILL THE LIVING FCK OUT OF THE ROCK&lt; DO NOT DILUTE&lt; REWARD THE EMPLOYEES AND EARLY INVESTORS WITH SHARE PRICE MOVEMENT. whats more, he has  a dislike of handing out equity and doing dilutive financing as a shareholder and mining stock gambler I like that.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that mentality in mind we come to his new project.

MARCH 24 2020. Chris Taylor becomes president of Dunnedin Resources "" We chose the Kodiak bear for our name to honour our company’s founder and chairman Chris Taylor and his fantastic exploration success with our  sister company Great Bear Resources. It symbolises that we are applying  the strategy that made Great Bear successful in the gold space to the  copper space: focusing on historically drilled brownfield assets that  have been under-appreciated, in producing belts, with excellent  infrastructure and year-round accessibility. We re-evaluate holistically  using new methods and technologies and establish new theories and  models for exploration. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Another plus for Kodiak is that they are a part of the [Discovery Group of companies](https://www.discoverygroup.ca/) which is a capital investment group which is made up of high networth investors who can finance the company. Their goal is usually to get their projects bought out. This is a huge safety net for Kodiak and a insurance policy that Kodiak isnt going to suddenly fold up and leave with your money.

&amp;#x200B;

A LAND OF COINCIDENCES

SO Chris Taylor is the President of the group and also the reason why the company exists. What about the current [Kodiak Copper CEO Claudia Tornquist.](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Claudia-Tornquist-0BJY98-E/biography/)

Claudia is also CEO of [Silver One resources](https://www.silverone.com/) and has a surprisingly high profile. Prior to venturing out and building her own companies, she was VP of Business Development at Sandstorm Gold (NYSE:SAND) which is interesting because VP business development at a gold royalties corp involves dealing with selling and buying prospective pieces of land to new companies (like the one shes working on now????)

She has also been the GM of RIO FUCKING TINTO (NYSE: RIO) -who originally drilled the project she is now working on btw -  which is one of the biggest industrial metals corps in the world.

What does all this mean?

Kodiak is currently trading for around $0.49/share. Kodiak has only 30 million shares (mcap: under 20M) and appears to be gearing up for their 2020 drilling season. They expect first results in august. If the results are good. The SP will whipsaw up because a 20m marketcap is nothing and even if it goes to 60m the sp will go to $1.60. giving you an easy 3 bagger just like that.

If it reports a GOOD hole result and the mcap goes to like 100 or 200 mill youre riding the rocket to neverneverland. looking at a sp of like $2 plus.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

SP: 1.20-2.50 END OF AUGUST.

If thats not a good bet i dont know what is

If that’s not your jam, please enjoy this cartoon of Alex Karp crushing the competition, then scroll down to the bottom of the DD where you’ll find my plan for the end of my lockup plus a few diamond emojiis, a couple of hand emojiis and a bunch of vacuum optimized transportation device emojiis.

[\(photo credit for the Karptoon goes to ex-Palantir designer u\/gottacroe and my wife u\/LindsayatAdaDiamonds photoshopping in the Salesforce Einstein\)](https://preview.redd.it/qo98za7m4ph61.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795b2bc3b634a695bf173008625a2ab6a4eeccf6)

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/opd8qiutdph61.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4bf46f2978e194792814abf31e84c3e19fa6632)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… 

# Big. 

# Fucking. 

# Deal. 

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&amp;E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&amp;T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). 

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany &amp; Co., and the FTC.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a [Keyser Söze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5k73jx2mIc) position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. 

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise &amp; Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpzxhuse5ph61.jpg?width=526&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e677cb560749bb8cbeeee1a64d4ac2a731ced48

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. 

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. 

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. 

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force 

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

[Palantir is the IL-ist SaaS on the market](https://preview.redd.it/eo8dcuir5ph61.jpg?width=1314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2c02e0131256508c34eeb0c2cdaeb26bc2a2eb)

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon 
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals 

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

&gt;*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/krrhl2b18ph61.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cd28bdbdab1e372fddb9a91002774fe44c0f900)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it. 

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5tuxd3v7ph61.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e0dc34fc3b59e2e308b1e2440c7b6d28a02bc3

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&amp;E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

&gt;*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal &amp; external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*   
&gt;  
&gt;*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines. 

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets. 

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server? 

&amp;#x200B;

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce). 

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&amp;E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&amp;E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&amp;E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization. 
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock. 

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right. 

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right. 

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes. 

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you. 

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla. 

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell very many shares this more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news. 

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at [the restaurant at the end of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ig3X59_qA) PLTR gang!

TORONTO, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **White Gold Corp. (TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W** ) (the “Company”) is pleased to provide an exploration update on the Bridget and Isaac porphyry targets located on the Pedlar and Hayes properties, respectively. Exploration work completed during 2023 included Induced Polarization (IP) chargeability and resistivity survey lines and hyperspectral analysis on 2022 prosecting rock samples. All data collected thus far on these large early-stage targets continue to support a porphyry deposit model.

The Pedlar and Hayes properties are situated in the southern part of the Company’s 315,000 hectare (3,150 km 2 ) land package in the White Gold District, west-central Yukon (Figure 1). Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s Casino copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry deposit (Measured &amp; Indicated Resources of 7.6 Blb copper and 14.5 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 3.3 Blb copper and 6.6 Moz gold) sits approximately 30 km southwest and 40 km west of the Bridget and Isaac targets respectively. Casino is one of the largest undeveloped copper-gold projects in Canada, and since 2021 has seen strategic investments by major partners including Rio Tinto Canada Inc. and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. The Pedlar and Hayes properties are also located 40 km and 72 km southeast, respectively, of the Company’s flagship White Gold project which contains an estimated 1,152,900 ounces of gold in Indicated Resources and 942,400 ounces of gold in Inferred Resources ( 1)

Terry Brace, Vice President of Exploration commented: “We are encouraged by results of the 2023 IP test lines at the Bridget and Isaac targets which identified new anomalies and structures that overall correlate well with the soil geochemistry anomalies and current structural interpretations. The new IP looked deeper than any previous geophysical surveys and demonstrates potential at depth beneath these large multi-element soil anomalies. The test results warrant full IP survey coverage over the target areas which will aid in mapping these systems at depth in support of future diamond drill testing.”

Shawn Ryan, co-founder, Chief Technical Advisor and Director, commented further: “The Bridget target has an interesting history as it was one of four top prospects that was first discovered back in 1972 when Silver Standard Mines conducted an extensive 14,000 plus regional silt survey looking for another Casino. During the large regional silt survey, Silver Standard also made the Minto Copper discovery and eventually focused all their attention on that target. I staked the Bridget prospect back in 2004, and since then the property has seen extensive soil sampling programs, airborne radiometric surveys and shallow RAB drilling. The soil sampling program revealed a large copper, molybdenum and bismuth soil anomaly. The molybdenum anomaly (2 to 322 ppm) measures 4 km by 1.7 km and coincides with a very discrete bismuth anomaly (2 to 154 ppm) of 3 km by 1.4 km and a copper core anomaly (50 to 711 ppm) measuring 2.8 km by 1.3 km. A deep penetrating dipole-dipole IP survey was undertaken in summer 2023 with one line over the core of the soil anomaly and the results clearly show a textbook porphyry geophysical signature of resistivity lows and chargeability high anomalies sitting below the anomalous soils. It’s now recommended to follow up with more IP survey lines to cover this large developing porphyry target. I look forward to first diamond drill holes into this exciting target.”

An overview of the Pedlar and Hayes properties, including the Bridget and Isaac targets, was provided previously in a news release dated April 5, 2023 which is available on the Company’s website ( [https://whitegoldcorp.ca/news/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zlIrJTE0xhipjC9X2HiUzNYkkUCI-d0UNJxdbPyapwWSVSglCBs0xs6-q7PvzfQGGVok_tPuQMUNzvHWUSCGAXLI1475kaDseQsiVYlNtAqU2_OUVHnJ4-x5ifQOS52D) ) and on SEDAR+.

**Highlights**

* The Bridget and Isaac targets represent large, early-stage, multi-element porphyry targets that have never been diamond drill tested.
* Deep penetrating test IP survey lines conducted over existing soil geochemistry anomalies have identified a total of 13 chargeability anomalies, 5 at Bridget and 8 at Isaac.
* The Bridget soil anomaly on the Pedlar property measures 3 km NW-SE by 3.5 km NE-SW and is interpreted to represent a copper-molybdenum porphyry target. It is geochemically zoned with a molybdenum-copper-bismuth core and a silver-zinc-lead-tungsten halo.
* At Bridget, one 1 st priority and four 2 nd priority chargeability anomalies were identified, with target depths ranging from 40 to 330 m. The chargeability anomalies underly a large molybdenum-copper soil anomaly, and a zone of moderate to strong chargeability to the southwest appears to mark a controlling WNW (290°) striking fault which correlates with anomalous lead-zinc-arsenic in soils.
* The Isaac soil anomaly on the Hayes property is a recently discovered target which measures 2 km E-W by 1.5 km N-S, and is interpreted to represent a copper-molybdenum porphyry target. It is geochemically zoned with a bismuth-arsenic-copper core and a silver-zinc-lead halo.
* At Isaac, four 1 st priority, three 2 nd priority and one 3 rd priority chargeability anomalies were identified, with target depths ranging from 50 to 550 m. The bismuth and copper core of the soil anomaly is underlain by multiple chargeability anomalies (S1, S2, M1 and W1 on Line 1E) which sit above a resistivity low. Anomalous lead, zinc, and silver, which form a halo around the core, are coincident with fault structures on the south side and north side of the survey area which trend NE (065°) and NW (290°) respectively.
* 2022 prospecting rock samples from both the Bridget and Isaac targets show anomalous trace element enrichments, including copper, molybdenum and silver, consistent with proximal porphyry copper-style mineralization.
* Hyperspectral analysis results for the prosecting rock samples at both Bridget and Isaac show alteration mineralogy consistent with a porphyry deposit model.
* The Company is currently planning its fully funded 2024 exploration program, focusing on its existing significant gold resources, new high grade gold discoveries and other high priority gold and multi-element targets. The Company will arrange a webinar to provide a more detailed overview of the 2023 exploration results and plans for 2024 at that time. Details to be announced in due course.

**Regional Setting – The Dawson Range**

The Dawson Range forms an east-southeast trending mountain range which hosts several important mineral deposits and prospects (Figure 2) including the Casino porphyry Copper-Gold deposit in the west. In the southeast near the community of Carmacks, the Minto Mine contains resources of 356 Mlb copper, 189 Koz gold, and 1.7 Moz silver in Indicated Resources and 370 Mlb copper, 207 Koz gold, and 1.9 Moz silver in Inferred Resources ( 5 ) , and the Carmacks Copper project hosts 652 Mlb copper, 302 Koz gold, 3.8 Moz silver in Measured and Indicated Resources and 38 Mlb copper, 13 Koz gold, and 215 Koz silver in Inferred Resources ( 6 ) (Granite Creek Copper Ltd.), both interpreted to represent metamorphosed copper-gold-silver porphyry deposits. Porphyry deposits in the Dawson Range can be divided into 2 major ages, Late Triassic (Minto, Carmacks) and Late Cretaceous (Casino, Cash, Revenue). In addition to porphyry mineralization, epithermal, skarn, and polymetallic to gold-dominant mineralized veins, breccias and fracture zones also occur throughout the Dawson Range ( 7 )

**2023 IP Surveys**

In August 2023, Simcoe Geoscience Limited (Simcoe) carried out 7.2 line-km of time domain induced polarization (IP) chargeability and resistivity surveying at the Bridget and Isaac targets using their wireless 2D Alpha IP™ system (see About IP Survey below). At Bridget, a single 3.0 km long IP test line (line 1N) oriented NE-SW was completed using a dipole-dipole configuration. At Isaac, two IP test lines totaling 4.2 km long were oriented perpendicular to each other at NE-SW (line 4N) and NW-SE (line 1E) using a dipole-pole-dipole configuration. Both configurations can detect anomalies up to 600+ m depth.

**IP Results**

At Bridget, five chargeability anomalies were identified on Line 1N (Figure 3), including one 1 st priority anomaly (S1) and four 2 nd priority anomalies (M1-M4). Anomaly S1 has a target depth of 130 m and is characterized by strong chargeability and low resistivity. Target depths on the second priority anomalies range from 40 m (M3, M4) to a maximum of 330 m (M1). These are characterized by moderate to high chargeability and low to high resistivity.

The Bridget chargeability anomalies are plotted in relation to soil geochemistry results in Figure 4 (molybdenum, copper, lead, zinc) and Figure 5 (copper). The chargeability anomalies generally correspond with a zone of low resistivity which underlie a large molybdenum-copper soil anomaly. A zone of moderate (M1) to strong (S1) chargeability in the southwest delineates a controlling west-northwest (WNW, 290°) striking fault structure, closely correlated with lead, zinc, and arsenic soil anomalies. To the northeast, a similar WNW (295°) anomaly in lead, zinc, and arsenic defines the boundary of this chargeability anomaly and coincides with a significant tungsten anomaly, positioned along the northeastern fringe of a molybdenum anomaly. It is worth noting that in 2018 the Company drilled 10 short rotary air blast (RAB) drill holes totalling 548.6 m over the area between chargeability anomalies M2 and S1. However, these RAB holes were testing surface soil anomalies and drilled to a shallow maximum depth of only 70 m, hence the newly IP chargeability anomalies identified are completely untested.

At Isaac, 8 chargeability anomalies were identified on Lines 1E and 4N. Five anomalies occur on Line 1E (Figure 6), including three 1 st priority anomalies (S1-S3), one 2 nd priority anomaly (M1) and one 3 rd priority anomaly (W1). The 1 st priority anomalies are characterized by moderate chargeability and low to high resistivity. Target depths of the 1 st priority anomalies range from 70 m (S3) to 250 m (S2). An additional three anomalies occur on Line 4N (Figure 7), including one 1 st priority anomaly (S1) and two 2nd priority anomalies (M1-M2) (see Figure 7). Target depths of these chargeability anomalies range from 220 – 550 m.

The Isaac chargeability anomalies on Line 1E, oriented NW-SE, are plotted in relation to soil geochemistry results for select elements (bismuth, copper, lead, silver) in Figure 8. The bismuth anomaly appears to be controlled by faults interpreted from the IP resistivity data. The bismuth and copper core of the soil anomaly is underlain by multiple chargeability anomalies (S1, S2, M1 and W1) which sit above a resistivity low which is interpreted as a fault structure. Lead, zinc, and silver, which form a halo around the core, are coincident with fault structures on the south side and north side of the survey area which trend NE (065°) and NW (290°) respectively. Isaac is a recently recognized (2021) target and has never been drilled tested.

**2023 Hyperspectral Analysis &amp; Results**

During 2023, crushed coarse rejects from 2022 prospecting rock samples from the Pedlar and Hayes properties were analyzed with an ASD TerraSpec ® 4 Hi-Res Mineral Spectrometer. Results were uploaded and processed using IMDEX’s aiSIRIS™ cloud-based mineral interpretation AI software to produce semi-quantitative, standardized mineral interpretations and analytics (see About Hyperspectral Analysis below).

The Hyperspectral analysis results for the prosecting rock samples show alteration mineralogy consistent with a porphyry deposit model.

A total of 17 prospecting rock samples were collected at the Bridget target and 19 samples at the Isaac target. Samples from both the Bridget and Isaac targets show anomalous trace element enrichments, including copper, molybdenum and silver, consistent with proximal porphyry copper-style mineralization. Hyperspectral data for the Isaac target samples provide evidence for phyllic alteration characterized by muscovite and potassic alteration, with evidence of propylitic alteration found only on the southern edge of the sampled area where significant chlorite is observed. The Bridget samples show no evidence of phyllic alteration, however most samples show both geochemical and hyperspectral evidence for widespread propylitic alteration involving epidote, chlorite and albite, as well as minor potassic alteration.

**Next Steps**

The Company is encouraged by the success of the IP test lines in detecting chargeability and resistivity anomalies beneath the soil geochemistry anomalies at the Bridget and Isaac targets at depths from 40m to 550m below surface. These results warrant full IP survey coverage over the target areas which will aid in identifying targets at depth in support of future diamond drill testing.

**About the Bridget Target**

The Bridget target area is located on the Pedlar property and was first explored by Silver Standard Mines Ltd. (“Silver Standard”) and Asarco Exploration Company of Canada Ltd. (“Asarco”) in the early 1970’s following the discovery of the Casino Copper-Gold-Molybdenum porphyry deposit. A series of regional silt samples, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys by Silver Standard in 1971 and 1972 led to the discovery of a significant molybdenum-copper geochemical anomaly, now known as the Bridget target. Historical exploration work between 2004 and 2016 included soil sampling, prospecting, geological mapping, and geophysical surveys. In 2016 the Company acquired ownership of the property and has continued to expand the large multi-element (molybdenum, copper, bismuth, tungsten, lead, silver) soil geochemical anomaly that currently measures 3 km NW-SE by 4.3 km NE-SW. In 2018, a maiden rotary air blast (RAB) drilling program comprising 10 holes totalling 548.6 m was completed; however, the RAB holes were short testing to a maximum vertical depth of only 70 m, well short of potential porphyry mineralization at depth beneath the anomalous soils. Porphyry targets characterized by IP chargeability high anomalies remain completely untested.

**About the Isaac Target**

The Isaac target is located on the Hayes property and was first recognized by the Company as a prospective porphyry target in 2021 through soil sampling. Gridded soil sampling (50 m spaced samples on 100 m spaced survey lines) was conducted in an area located approximately 5 km south of the Yukon River where a 2017 reconnaissance soil survey identified several isolated anomalous ridge and spur soil samples. The 2021 sampling identified a new geochemically zoned multi-element soil anomaly named the Isaac target, which measures approximately 2 km east-west by 1.5 km north-south. The anomaly has a central core measuring from 750 m to 1,000 m in diameter and enriched in bismuth and arsenic, which is surrounded by a halo of anomalous silver, lead and zinc that is greater than 400 m wide. Anomalous copper occurs in the southern portion of the core, and a relatively small area of anomalous molybdenum occurs near the core’s northern margin. Geologically the soil anomaly is associated with a plug of Late Cretaceous Prospector Mountain suite, which is known to be prospective for porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum and epithermal style mineralization. The geochemical zonation and elemental distributions indicate that the anomaly may represent the surface expression of a copper-molybdenum porphyry core surrounded by distal or epithermal style silver-lead-zinc mineralization. Follow-up geological mapping and prospecting in 2022 at the Isaac target area returned anomalous copper values from the core area of the soil anomaly, with three grab samples returning from 730.6 – 1269.2 ppm Copper.

**About Hyperspectral Analysis**

Crushed coarse rejects from 2022 prospecting rock samples were analyzed with an ASD TerraSpec ® 4 Hi-Res Mineral Spectrometer by Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd. at their preparation laboratory in Whitehorse, Yukon. Results were uploaded and processed using IMDEX’s aiSIRIS™ cloud-based mineral interpretation AI software to produce semi-quantitative, standardized mineral interpretations and analytics. TerraSpec and aiSIRIS data were reviewed and interpreted by Dr. Dennis Arne, a principal consulting geochemist with Telemark Geosciences Pty Ltd, a geological consulting services company based in Victoria, Australia.

The 2023 IP surveys were completed by Simcoe Geoscience Limited (Simcoe) using their wireless time domain 2D Alpha IP™ system ( [https://www.simcoegeoscience.com/wireless-alpha-ip](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zlIrJTE0xhipjC9X2HiUzF8zMcStfa1jYU9zMyyTVUuK7PjpgVH6bcEfP38ELMdfAb_JWJqZy7xjakjs4ddGuM__OYdzbTAyZXFalDjQpxbAbec8Qe1dA70a2tzE9FfTvI2awEWhvcq1JrZHGvkKDvk4m403kBKU-wfw-isRB70=) ). Survey data was recorded in a Reverse &amp; Forward array configuration with readings taken every 100 m along the line. A dipole-dipole configuration was used at the Bridget target, and a dipole-pole-dipole configuration at the Isaac target. Once the IP data satisfied the QA/QC process, the entire survey line file was exported into UBC format to run the model 2D inversions. Results were reviewed, interpreted and chargeability anomalies ranked by Simcoe’s in-house geophysicist.

Washington, D.C.--(Newsfile Corp. - February 23, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC PINK: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") Chief External Affairs Officer and Head of Climate Strategy Todd Malan was selected to lead the public testimony during yesterday's US Treasury's public hearing on Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit for Critical Minerals.

*""It was an honor to share Talon's perspective on how the 45X tax credit for critical minerals was intended by Congress to support domestic mineral extraction. We shared two proposals that we think respond to the Treasury Department's concerns about foreign sourced minerals qualifying for a domestic production incentive. If our proposals are adopted, they will provide long-term financial support to the domestic production of eligible critical minerals like nickel,""* Malan commented after addressing the Treasury/IRS panel. He added, ""*As the IRA's support for secure supply chains in critical minerals is being challenged by Chinese oversupply of these minerals which is driving down prices, a comprehensive 45X tax credit that includes extraction of raw materials from the geology of the United States would be very timely support for the critical mineral supply chain.""*

Section 45X of the *Inflation Reduction Act* (IRA) is a production tax credit intending to incentivize investments in the full manufacturing supply chain of clean energy systems like electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Section 45X applies to the manufacturing of equipment used in solar, wind, hydrogen and batteries and also credits critical minerals production applying to specific elements in the periodic table. The list includes nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals that are all present in the high-grade ores that Talon plans to extract from the underground mine at the Tamarack Nickel Project (which is currently in the environmental review process conducted by Minnesota regulators and tribal sovereign governments as part of the State's permitting process).

The 45X production tax credit for critical minerals is equal to 10% of the annual production cost of producing the specified element to a certain level of purity. Remarkably, the 45X tax credit for critical minerals does not decline over time or expire.

Under IRS precedent, ""production cost"" would usually include the cost of acquiring raw materials along with employee costs, energy, depreciation of equipment etc. However, the US Treasury indicated in draft regulations issued on December 15, 2023, that it was withholding allowing the cost of raw materials from the calculation of production cost for the 45X critical minerals tax credit to further study potential abuse and how it could allow raw materials cost to be included consistent with the intent of Congress. Today's hearing was part of an effort to obtain input from experts and stakeholders on this specific question.

Talon believes that Congress created this extraordinary tax credit for critical minerals to benefit the entire U.S. supply chain for critical minerals from mining to recycling. Also, the statutory language clearly states that the 45X tax credit only applies to production that occurs within the United States or its possessions. In the case of applicable critical minerals, the mineral *is* the component, so it stands to reason that only the cost of extraction of such mineral (in its raw form) occurring in the US or its possessions should qualify for the 45X tax credit in calculating the cost of production of such mineral.

Malan explained to the Treasury and IRS panel that Talon remains committed to President Biden's vision for responsible mining and securing America's critical mineral supply chains. He pointed out that producing sustainably sourced critical minerals has national security implications given Chinese and Russian dominance of critical minerals like nickel. Malan outlined Talon's recommendation to the Treasury that a taxpayer producing an applicable critical mineral as specified in the law should be able to include the full cost of purchasing the ""source material"" or ore in the calculation of the 45X tax credit. To include raw materials cost in the calculation of production cost of the critical mineral to the specific level of purity, the taxpayer would need to obtain:

* Certification that the raw materials (mined ore that is physically processed prior to refining) has a chemical characteristic (assay) that indicates that it is the source of the final eligible critical mineral;
* Certification that the raw materials were extracted from the geology of the United States;
* Certification that such supplier has not itself claimed the 45X tax credit with regard to any of the same costs; and
* Certification that such supplier has not provided certification related to any of the same costs to any other entity.

Talon believes this ""Buy American"" proposal for adding raw materials extraction cost to the calculation of production cost using definitions under § 1.263A - applied to raw materials extracted in the US -- is easily administrable, addresses the concerns of the Treasury Department that it must ensure that ""foreign minerals"" cannot benefit from the 45X tax credit, and is consistent with the intent of Congress in enacting 45X as applied to critical minerals: to cover the full US sourced supply chain required to produce eligible applicable critical minerals.

SMCI- Hit that $1000, broke it, then utterly collapsed. I was out of town Friday, but this was probably the best trade of the year. Worth watching for any additional moves down, but other than that I’m going to be hands-off.

NVDA- Failed to break that $750 that I was interested in (highest we got was $745), and sold off at the open. For me, this is a hands-off until the earnings report. Looks like the semis/AI run-up might be over unless they report a blow-out earnings.

New Leases Augment Talon's 400,000 Acres of Mineral Rights in Highly Prospective Nickel District, Currently Host to the Only Operating High-Grade Nickel Mine in the USA

Tamarack, Minnesota--(Newsfile Corp. - January 31, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") received confirmation on January 30, 2024 from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources that its Administrative Board approved the Company's application (through its subsidiaries) for 23,000 acres of additional mineral leases in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

The 23,000 acres of mineral leases augment the [Company's announcement on August 10, 2022](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/AM30ncMP8n) that it entered into an option and earn-in agreement (the **""Option Agreement""**) with UPX Minerals Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sweetwater Royalties) (**""UPX""**) to acquire up to an 80% ownership interest in the mineral rights over a land package comprised of approximately 400,000 acres located in the Upper Peninsula of the State of Michigan. This land package was originally assembled by Henry Ford and owned for approximately 70 years by the Ford Motor Company.

The combined land package covers highly prospective terrain within 1.7 miles (2.8km) of the high-grade Eagle Nickel Mine (the only active nickel mine in the USA today) and is only 0.4 miles (0.6km) from the Humboldt Mill (the concentrator which currently processes the raw nickel ore from the Eagle Nickel Mine).

[On September 12, 2023, the Department of Defense selected Talon for $20.6 million in grant funding](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/ZAezaie1yD) from the *Defense Production Act* to explore and discover more high-grade nickel mineralization in Michigan and Minnesota.

Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon said: *""Our exploration team's sole focus is to discover more high-grade nickel deposits in the United States. With funding from the Department of Defense, Talon will bring its proven approach to exploration drilling and geophysical analysis to try to discover new high-grade nickel and copper mineralization in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, currently the only region with a nickel mine in the United States.""*

Mr. van Rooyen continued: *""Within the mineral sourcing requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act's electric vehicle tax credits, minerals sourced domestically enjoy the highest level of preference under the law. The United States is currently dependent on foreign countries such as Russia and China for nickel, which is an untenable supply chain vulnerability. This extraordinary context is why Talon is advancing its proposed Tamarack Underground Mine proposal through the Minnesota environmental review process while also exploring for additional high-grade deposits in both Minnesota and Michigan.""*

*He continued, ""Mineral exploration and geophysics are science but also an art. It is not just finding a needle in a haystack; it's finding a needle in a haystack if the haystack was in a dark barn and you're wearing dark sunglasses. The haystack in this case was buried deep underground millions of years ago. Talon's experienced team is using cutting edge technology, our own drill rigs and in-house drill teams to find more nickel in America. We are conducting drilling and geophysics in Minnesota on a 24/7 basis and are excited to get started in Michigan this spring.""*

*""The Michigan DNR approval process included opportunity for extensive public comment. We are planning to host a community ""Open House"" in the spring prior to any drilling and we have had a number of information sharing meetings with proximate Tribal sovereign governments to discuss our initial area of interest for mineral exploration, seek their feedback and discuss the potential contribution of tribal knowledge in our fieldwork,""* said Cody Mayer, Community &amp; Tribal Engagement Liaison for Talon. Mayer is based in Marquette, Michigan and is the Company's first Michigan based employee. He continued, *""Exploration drilling and geophysics is essentially about understanding what Michigan has in its natural resource wealth. Having this information means policymakers are better able to plan for secure domestic supply chains in the future. If this exploration process results in the discovery of a mineable resource like the Eagle Mine, which has successfully operated in this region since 2014, it will ultimately be up to society to decide if that newly discovered resource will be extracted and contribute to domestic supply chains. For now, Talon is committed to protecting the environment during this exploration phase, being transparent with the community by sharing information about our operations, plans and exploration results.""*

PALM BEACH, Fla., Jan. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [*FN Media Group*](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ABFSpvo3z6amAAAn0NiM4nHLY8Yfu2QqKtg-Jocf2m3y1AoScsbF7MqzNggw66_dK3kq6uqKrdTdKY7_2REfQZvp5S5kTTe5F4RLRb-ZvBE=) *News Commentary*

* While the pandemic caused significant disruption to the copper mining market growth, In post-pandemic 2022, prices of technological materials, energy, fuels, and services increased significantly, influencing the level of costs generated by the companies. On the other hand, the uncertainty about the future global economic situation resulted in the weakening of the USD and increase in USD-denominated copper prices, translating into an increase in revenues from sales. A [report](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Xwwp4-Ave-feEfWu0rMu65ID8gQSpDzFEatyFUovgRQr_DXy8Emgupi7bMKCN2Nl_iV2ZJ8daF_gzMcl9VbfVz1xnnlb7QiQGGNZJGyu51TBw8qUJcXu8P4FWeZOmEIZI8tCTjkmVEs_HirSdjQLwQ==) from Fortune Business Insights said that the global copper mining market size, which was valued at USD 8.44 billion in 2022 is projected to grow from USD 8.87 billion in 2023 to USD 11.17 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 3.3% during the forecast period. The report added: “Government policies, regulations, and taxation frameworks can significantly impact the mining industry. Political stability, legal frameworks, mining codes, and fiscal policies affect investment attractiveness, licensing, and permitting processes. Copper is essential for constructing infrastructure projects such as buildings, bridges, and electrical systems. Hence, government initiatives and policies promoting infrastructure development can significantly boost the market. The mining industry, mainly of copper, will likely increase significantly due to increased investment in construction and construction projects. For example, over 100 smart city projects are underway worldwide, creating tremendous opportunities for the construction industry. Rapid urbanization in emerging economies and ongoing construction projects worldwide lead to increased copper consumption.” Active mining companies in the markets this week include **American Pacific Mining Corp.** (OTCQX: USGDF) (CSE: USGD) (FWB: 1QC), **Rio Tinto Group** (NYSE: RIO), **Freeport-McMoRan Inc.** (NYSE: FCX), **Lundin Mining Corporation** (NASDAQ: LUMI) (TSX: LUN), **Filo Corp.** (OTCQX: FLMMF) (TSX: FIL).

Fortune Business Insights continued: “Furthermore, copper is also widely used in renewable energy infrastructure and EVs to build electrical wiring, transformers, batteries, and charging infrastructure, and the regulation related to the adoption of renewable energy and EVs will also push the demand for mining of copper. The primary driver of this industry is the demand for copper as a raw material in various sectors, including construction, infrastructure development, electrical and electronics, transportation, and manufacturing. Furthermore, increasing population, urbanization, and industrialization in developing countries have increased copper demand.”

**American Pacific Mining Corp. (OTCQX: USGDF) (CSE: USGD) (FWB: 1QC) REPORTS MOST SIGNIFICANT COPPER DRILL INTERSECTIONS REPORTED TO-DATE AT ITS PALMER VMS PROJECT, INCLUDING 43.8 METRES OF 6.54% AND 23.9 METRES OF 9.03% COPPER -** American Pacific Mining Corp (“American Pacific” or the “Company”) is pleased to report the third and final batch of assay results from the 2023 resource definition and geotechnical drill programs at the Palmer Project (“Palmer” or the “Project”). Palmer is an advanced-stage, high-grade volcanogenic massive sulphide-sulphate deposit (“VMS”) located in the Porcupine Mining District of the Haines Borough, Alaska, USA. Constantine North Inc., a subsidiary of American Pacific, is the operator for the Project and the \~US$20 million 2023 program was funded by joint venture (“JV”) partner Dowa Metals &amp; Mining Co., Ltd (“Dowa”).

The final batch of 2023 assay results include the four (4) most significant copper (“Cu”) drill intersections (grade x thickness) reported to-date at Palmer, with significant zinc (“Zn”), gold (“Au”) and silver (“Ag”) results, as well.

**Highlights include:**

* CMR23-172 Zone 1: 43.8 m grading 6.54% Cu, 3.15% Zn, 0.42 g/t Au and 27.97 g/t Ag (8.22% CuEq)

Peter Mercer, Senior Vice President, Advanced Projects commented, “The final assay results from our 2023 resource definition drilling at the Palmer Project have exceeded expectations with tremendous copper grades and aggregate metals values over significant widths. Last year’s drilling has extended the mineralized envelope beyond the current MRE model. Our team is actively working to update our 3D geological model. Preliminary interpretations have highlighted several priority target areas for follow-up drilling in 2024. In addition, the knowledge gained from this year’s drilling will provide valuable insights as we re-evaluate and rank the numerous VMS showings throughout the mineralized district.”

**Summary of Latest Assay Results and Key Takeaways -** The 2023 diamond drill program successfully targeted high-priority areas in two unique mineralized lenses, Zone 1 and Zone 2-3, which together make up the South Wall Zone of the Palmer deposit. The third and final batch of assay results reported in this release consists of 13 drillholes (seven at Zone 1, five at Zone 2-3, and one geotechnical drill hole at the RW Oxide Zone). See Company news releases dated October 18 and November 14, 2023, for previous 2023 assay results.

Three primary takeaways from the latest results:

1. High-grade copper mineralization with strong metal zoning demonstrated in the core of Zone 1.
2. Cu-Zn mineralization extends beyond the limits of the mineral resource estimate (“MRE”) in Zone 1 highlighting the potential for mineral resource expansion and the discovery of additional lenses downdip and along strike.
3. Increased confidence in the current MRE and the 2023 infill drilling provides better methodology for assessing feasibility-level drill space requirements.

The Company is incorporating all 2023 results into its 3D geological model and completing further interpretation/analysis and target ranking in preparation for the upcoming 2024 drill season.

The focus this year was drilling within the Aurora Zone and connecting the gap that previously existed between Aurora and Bonita. In addition to producing some of our best ever drill intersections, drilling at Aurora refined our geological interpretation and improved our understanding of the deposit, leading to the development of a 3D deposit model. Step-out holes highlighted that there is no gap between Aurora and Bonita and it is all part of one continuously mineralized trend which is open at both ends. The opportunity for substantial growth of the deposit and the potential for new discoveries was highlighted by the results of geophysical surveys completed during the year and the discovery of new styles of mineralization in several drill holes.

Copper, culture, and politics collide as Trump hosts mining titans in Oval Office showdown over Arizona’s most controversial project.

https://preview.redd.it/5k2ewo9pd7kf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=878e31b805508395954cc103367cc54a1b7ad2b9

In the Oval Office this week, President Donald Trump met with BHP CEO Mike Henry and Rio Tinto executives Jakob Stausholm and Simon Trott to discuss the fate of Resolution Copper, a vast mining project in Arizona that has been mired in legal and political battles for decades. The high-stakes meeting underscored how one of the largest untapped copper deposits in North America has become a lightning rod in the broader struggle over America’s mineral security, environmental protection, and Indigenous rights.

The timing was no accident. Just one day earlier, a federal appeals court issued a temporary injunction halting the transfer of federal forest land to the mining giants, delaying the project once again. For President Trump, who has made reshoring supply chains and boosting resource independence central to his agenda, the ruling was more than a setback. He lashed out at opponents online, branding them “radical left activists” and accusing them of serving the interests of foreign competitors rather than American workers.

**Resolution Copper’s Promise and Peril**

The Resolution Copper project, located about 60 miles east of Phoenix, is touted as one of the richest copper ore bodies ever discovered. If developed, it could supply as much as 25 percent of US copper demand for decades, according to company estimates. The mine promises billions in economic activity, thousands of jobs, and a direct boost to industries ranging from clean energy to defense manufacturing. Copper is essential for everything from electric vehicles and power grids to missiles and smartphones, making it one of the most strategically important minerals of the 21st century.

Yet for the San Carlos Apache Tribe and other Indigenous communities, the project represents something very different. At the heart of the dispute is Oak Flat, a site considered sacred for centuries, used for religious ceremonies, prayer, and gathering of medicinal plants. Tribal leaders warn that the massive underground mine would devastate the land, swallowing sacred ground in a crater nearly two miles wide and more than a thousand feet deep. For them, the fight is not simply about resource development but about cultural survival.

**The Legal Deadlock**

The injunction issued by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily halted a land exchange mandated by Congress in 2014 under President Barack Obama. That provision, tucked into a defense spending bill, required the US Forest Service to transfer Oak Flat to Resolution Copper once environmental reviews were completed. Opponents argue those reviews were insufficient, failing to account for risks such as tailings dam breaches or pipeline failures. They also claim the government undervalued the land, excluding the immense copper reserves buried far below.

The appeals court will hear arguments on the merits of the case later this year, but for now the future of Resolution Copper hangs in limbo. The companies insist the pause is temporary. Resolution Copper released a statement calling the court’s decision a hurdle but not a roadblock, stressing that its plan was shaped through years of consultation with tribal groups and environmental experts. The US Forest Service, for its part, has argued that it has little discretion, since Congress already ordered the land swap.

**Trump’s Energy and Security Agenda**

For President Trump, the project represents more than an economic opportunity. He has repeatedly linked domestic copper production to national security, arguing that America cannot afford to depend on foreign sources for critical minerals. With global copper prices hovering near historic highs and geopolitical tensions with China intensifying, the case for US self-sufficiency is growing louder. Trump has warned that blocking the mine undermines America’s ability to compete in clean energy, defense, and advanced technology.

At the White House meeting, BHP’s Mike Henry emphasized the project’s potential to create “thousands of high-value local jobs in Arizona and billions in economic activity across America.” Rio Tinto executives echoed that message, presenting the mine as not only profitable but essential to meeting the country’s long-term mineral needs.

**A Clash That Won’t Go Away**

The battle over Oak Flat has already lasted two decades, and the latest injunction ensures it will continue for months if not years. For mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto, Resolution Copper is a crown jewel they are unwilling to abandon. For Native American tribes and environmentalists, it is a line in the sand they cannot allow to be crossed.

The stakes are immense. Beyond the billions in projected revenue and the thousands of jobs at risk, the dispute has become a test of how America balances industrial ambition with cultural preservation and environmental responsibility. With copper at the heart of the energy transition and defense readiness, the outcome will ripple far beyond Arizona’s desert.

**Conclusion**

The Oval Office meeting highlighted the growing collision between America’s drive for mineral independence and the rights of communities fighting to preserve their heritage. Whether Resolution Copper becomes a cornerstone of US resource security or another casualty of political and legal battles remains uncertain. What is clear is that the project has become a flashpoint in the larger debate over how far the nation is willing to go in pursuit of economic growth, security, and energy transition.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:57.766644,2025-08-21T02:42:38,Rio Tinto,2025
483,1gwktsg,UUUU: The next Rio Tinto (RIO),Rippedyanu1,/r/pennystocks/comments/1gwktsg/uuuu_the_next_rio_tinto_rio/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1gwktsg/uuuu_the_next_rio_tinto_rio/,51,23,1732210028.0,"TL:DR: UUUU is worth at least 80+ USD per share in the next 5 years. By 2034 I wouldn’t be surprised if they were worth over 150 USD per share.

Hi Everyone,

UUUU has been shockingly undervalued for months as a result of Rare Earth bears opening heavy short positions on a company they don’t fully understand and Uranium bulls not being super keen on them despite UUUU being the largest US producer of Uranium. Based on my calculations, at current market values for their assets and the cost to pull them out of the ground and sell on the market, this company should be valued at well over 10 Billion USD in Market Cap if not higher. MUCH higher.

Energy Fuels is a company that has been mining and producing Uranium for well over 40 years now and has arguably one of the best conventional and In-Situ Recovery Uranium mining teams on the planet. They have \~70 million pounds in the ground total of Uranium assets that as a whole will cost \~40 dollars/pound to extract, process and sell and then clean up the mine when they’re done. Just from their Uranium assets, at its current spot market value ~$80/pound (term values are higher and the average term price of Uranium for Energy fuels is currently in the high 80s/pound and can go upwards of 130/pound in their current contracts but I want to use spot as an easy to understand floor on their Uranium valuation) that is a profit of 3.01 Billion USD over the course of say 13 years (they plan to ramp up production of their own uranium assets to 5-6million pounds of Uranium in the coming years which on average will take ~13 years to fully deplete the mines). This puts the expected revenue per year at 450 million USD and pure profit 230 million USD per year on average. Uranium is still expected to increase in value with expected conservative values being up to 120-150 USD/pound as U3O8 is a minimal expense on reactors and is required in order for a reactor to actually operate. If Uranium hits these expected values then the floor numbers instead become (using an average of 135 USD/pound) a revenue of 730 million USD per year and a profit of 550 million per year.

Adding further onto the Uranium case, Energy Fuels also owns not 1 but 2 licensed and operational Uranium processing mills. White Mesa (Conventional) and Nichols Ranch (In Situ). These facilities combined have a licensed capacity of 10 million pounds per year and White Mesa is the ONLY Conventional Uranium mill in the United States and there are a lot of Conventional Uranium miners in the US that will need to use their mill in order to get refined Uranium to sell. This adds capex to other miners but in turn increases the profits for Energy Fuels. What’s also important is that Energy Fuels gets to keep the tailings and for other processors that’s not that important, but for Energy Fuels it’s an incredible valuable resource that I will get into later.

That’s just the Uranium alone. But Energy Fuels is special. VERY special. They are the ONLY Western company that can refine Monazite for profit because Energy Fuels isn’t just a Uranium company. If they were I wouldn’t have titled this thread the way I did. They have a few aces up their sleeve that get reported on by analysts but never seem to put the entire puzzle together because if they did, they’d have a hell of a lot higher price targets than they do currently.

Energy Fuels also has a budding and VERY valuable Rare Earths business that synergizes extremely well with their Uranium business. Their Rare Earth and Heavy Sands (HMS) assets are the Toliara Project, Bahia Project, Kwale Operations and a Joint Venture on Donald Project. The most important of these projects is the Toliara Project. The best comparison I can make for Toliara in terms of value is with Nexgen’s Arrow and Rook deposits, widely regarded as the best Uranium deposits on the Planet and the reason NXE is trading for nearly 5 billion USD in market cap. Toliara is the Rare Earths and HMS equivalent or greater than Arrow and Rook combined and Energy Fuels scooped up that project AND the entire company and staff that will operate it for under 200 million USD.

Dysprosium sells for 186 USD/pound and was at a high of 260 per pound last year. Terbium sells for 700 USD/pound and is also down quite heavily from the 2023 highs. [You can follow the current values of both per kg at this website](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/current-strategic-metals-prices/). [Just last month the DoD gave a company 4.4 million to recycle fluorescent light bulbs for Terbium](https://northamericanmining.com/index.php/2024/09/16/dod-invests-millions-in-terbium-production/). You can damn well bet they'll pay Energy fuels a hell of a lot more for Terbium by the ton in a few years. The Titanium and Zirconium heavy sands production for Energy Fuels through their Base Resources subsidiary will fund the entirety of the mining at Toliara and their other Rare Earth Deposits per their latest webinar found [here](https://app.webinar.net/MdbnyLZJk7L). Honestly the webinar will give you all the DD you need for this company. It will also generate substantial free cash flow on its own. These deposits also hold a large amount of what other companies consider to be a waste resource called monazite. Monazite is the reason that Energy Fuels ventured into the Rare Earths business to begin with because they are the only Non-chinese company that can process Monazite for profit because of the high-grade levels of Uranium and other rare earth minerals it contains. Rare Earth companies usually dump monazite back into the mine because it’s so rich with Uranium and Thorium, and Uranium miners don’t bother with it because it’s a massive pain to refine and more costly for them if they don’t have the specialized processes already on hand to extract the Uranium from it. Energy Fuels is uniquely positioned to take advantage of monazite processing and have already done so at scale.

Come 2028 Energy fuels will be completing the upgrades to their White Mesa mill so that it can refine Rare Earths and Monazite in tandem with Uranium. At the same time their Rare Earth projects will also have been online for \~1 year and sending material to be refined at the mine allowing for immediate return on investment once the mill upgrades are completed. At the mill they will be refining and selling 200-300 tons per year of Terbium and Dysprosium, 4-6000 tons per year of Neodymium+ Praseodymium and from monazite an additional 350k pounds of uranium per year on top of the 5-6 million pounds per year of Uranium from the Uranium assets that they will also be refining.

At the current values of Titanium, Zirconium, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Dysprosium, Terbium, Uranium, Thorium and other mineral, these assets should return in profit in excess of 1 Billion USD per year at current mineral values. At the high end of their production timeline for monazite we get a revenue value of 1.23 billion USD for only NdPr, Dy and Tb, the low end gives 820million USD. These are almost entirely profit due to the monazite being a byproduct funded by the HMS mining. This does not include the sales of 5-6 million lbs of Uranium nor the 175k to 350k extra of U from monazite. Uranium bolts on an additional 730mill USD revenue at 135/lb (550mill FCF). Titanium and Zirconium values will add an additional multi-hundred million USD (960 ktonnes of ilmenite @ 300/tonne, 8 tonnes of rutile @ 1500 per tonne and 66 tonnes of zircon @ 2000/tonne = 432 million USD for Toliara alone) source of revenue with multiple hundreds of millions in free cash flow (FCF expected around 340mill USD, again for Toliara alone). As the REE market comes out of its bear market and Uranium continues its bull run that profit value will multiply and easily become 7-8+ Billion USD per year for revenue for the next 30+ years (expected lifecycle of these projects).

I’m still not done. They have another also extremely exciting and budding industry in the Biotech and Pharmaceuticals industry through Radioactive Isotope Therapy Treatments. The isotopes that are in critical need for this Therapy exist at commercial scale in Energy Fuels tailings. Back in 2021 they began a feasibility study with RadTran LLC to see if it would be worth trying to commercialize the tailings for those isotopes. The findings were so lucrative Energy Fuels proceeded to buy and absorb RadTran LLC in its entirety a gain an RnD license for producing these isotopes with plans to gain a commercial license in the future. I can’t put a value on that (edit: I can now, Radium-226 goes for 10 million USD/gram, if UUUU can even make a pound of that its 500million in revenue and they're aiming to go to commercial levels after 2026 and starting small in 2025) but I can tell you pharmaceutical companies are currently pouring 10s of billions of dollars into this field for cancer treatments and it’s another shovel that Energy Fuels will be happy to sell.

The company currently has 140 million in liquidity, zero debt (something incredibly rare for a mining company) and very minimal dilution without a need to dilute heavily because they are about to be cash flow positive and can afford their current operations for years with the cash on hand and what they will make with operations and sales.

Couple all of these pieces of the puzzle together and the valuation I gave at the beginning of 10 Billion USD for a market cap is honestly really lowballing it. At current prices their per year profit would be ~ 2 billion. As their commodities increase in value due to increasingly geopolitical tensions and necessities for production of various industries, that profit rises exponentially. Energy Fuels has the goal of being the US and the West's one stop shop for any critical mineral and a secured supply chain for the United States. This also means they're likely to get some heavy loving and subsidiaries from Uncle Sam.

Energy Fuels knows they can’t be as big in the Uranium space as Cameco (CCJ), Kazatomprom (KAP), Nexgen's (NXE) Arrow deposit, Denison mines (DNN) etc. so instead they found a way to be the next Rio Tinto (RIO) or close to it, specifically the next radioactive mineral equivalent of Rio Tinto which trades at a 110Billion market cap. If UUUU even becomes worth 20% of that which I think is a fair assessment given the above points (I didn't even get into vanadium mineralization) that would be ~120 a share based on the current float. This is a very conservative estimate based on current mineral values, not what the minerals will be worth in 5+ years. Honestly, that excites me a heck of a lot more than being the next Cameco. I will continue to throw paycheck after paycheck at this company because I fully expect and believe based on their assets and my calculations that the company is worth over 80/share in the next 5 years and frankly could go to 150+ a share 10 years from now. This is a company I have poured my entire life’s worth on and as soon as I leave my current job and take my vested 401 with me, I’m shoving that 401 into my Roth throw a rollover and betting it all on UUUU. I am so bullish on this company I sell deep in the money put options to get premium to buy long calls on the stock for extra leverage. I will continue to utilize this options strategy to amass more shares until I have over 10,000 shares of UUUU because I can’t be bullish enough on this company. They have the physical assets, the expertise, the facilities, the cash and the knowledge on hand to become a juggernaut of the mineral sector. And I know they will become one.

A Leadership Shakeup Rocks Rio Tinto and the Mining Industry

https://preview.redd.it/urfw3krhic2f1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4d58af40d5732afe2dde15474fcec1d9e8301af

In a bombshell announcement that’s sent shockwaves through the mining world, Rio Tinto (ASX, LON: RIO) revealed on Thursday that CEO Jakob Stausholm will step down later this year, capping a nearly five-year tenure that saw the mining giant pivot toward energy transition metals and grapple with a controversial past. The news, as unexpected as a plot twist in a Hollywood thriller, has left analysts and investors scrambling to make sense of the sudden departure.

Stausholm, who took the helm in 2021 after joining Rio in 2018, steered the company through turbulent waters following the infamous destruction of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelters in Western Australia. The incident, which cost his predecessor Jean-Sébastien Jacques his job, thrust Stausholm into the spotlight with a mandate to rebuild trust with stakeholders, Indigenous groups, and investors. By all accounts, he delivered—expanding Rio Tinto’s portfolio into high-demand commodities like copper, lithium, and aluminium while championing stronger environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.

In a LinkedIn post that radiated pride but offered no clues about his exit, Stausholm called leading Rio Tinto “an honour” and emphasized that it’s “business as usual” while the company hunts for his successor. “A rigorous process is already underway,” he wrote, leaving the mining world buzzing with speculation about who’ll fill his shoes.

**A Surprise Exit Sparks Questions**

The announcement caught analysts off guard, with Berenberg’s Richard Hatch calling it “a big surprise” that “doesn’t feel that natural.” BMO’s Alexander Pearce echoed the sentiment, noting Stausholm’s relatively short tenure and crediting him with bolstering Rio’s position in future-facing metals. So, why now? Rio Tinto remained tight-lipped about the reasons behind Stausholm’s departure, leaving room for speculation about internal pressures or a strategic shift.

Internally, iron ore chief Simon Trott and chief commercial officer Bold Baatar are rumored as frontrunners to take the top job. Meanwhile, analysts expect Rio to cast a wide net, though competition looms large—rival BHP is also on the hunt for a new CEO as Mike Henry prepares to exit within the next year. Talk about a mining leadership shakeup!

**Stausholm’s Legacy: Bold Moves and Big Bets**

Stausholm’s tenure wasn’t without its triumphs. The Danish executive expanded Rio Tinto’s iron ore empire beyond its Pilbara stronghold, securing approvals for the colossal Simandou project in Guinea, set to kick off production later this year. He also orchestrated a $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium and inked a $900 million lithium joint venture with Chile’s state-owned Codelco, cementing Rio’s foothold in the Lithium Triangle’s brine riches.

Beyond growth, Stausholm faced shareholder heat, including a high-profile campaign led by Palliser Capital and over 100 investors to rethink Rio’s dual listing structure in London and Sydney. The proposal was shot down earlier this month, but it underscored the intense scrutiny Stausholm navigated with finesse.

“Jakob restored trust with key stakeholders, aligned our portfolio with high-demand commodities, and set a compelling growth trajectory,” said Rio Tinto chair Dominic Barton, tipping his hat to Stausholm’s leadership.

**Fortescue Joins the Exit Parade**

As if one bombshell wasn’t enough, the mining sector got another jolt just an hour after Rio’s announcement. Fortescue (ASX: FMG) revealed that its energy chief, Mark Hutchinson, is also stepping down, with chief operating officer Shelley Robertson retiring as well. Former Argentine rugby captain Agustin Pichot will take the reins of Fortescue’s growth and energy division, tasked with driving its green energy ambitions. Talk about a double whammy for Australia’s mining giants!

**What’s Next for Rio Tinto?**

With Stausholm’s exit looming, all eyes are on Rio Tinto’s next move. Will the company tap an internal heavyweight or bring in fresh blood to lead its charge into the energy transition? And how will this leadership pivot shape its rivalry with BHP and others in the race for critical minerals? One thing’s for sure: the mining world is in for a wild ride.

For now, Stausholm remains at the helm, ensuring a smooth transition as Rio Tinto hunts for its next visionary. Stay tuned—this story is far from over.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:57.766722,2025-05-23T00:43:53,Rio Tinto,2025

Citajuci polugodisnji izvjestaj, naletio sam na nekoliko interesatnih stvari za nas. Investicija kako stoje stvari ce biti 2.4 milijarde dolara. Trajanje iskopa procjena na 40 godina. Prva ruda na trziste ide 2026, maksimalni kapaciteti 2029. Oko 3000 radnih mjesta. Doprinos BDP-u 1% direktno i 4% indirektno.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Uglavnom, evo par detalja iz njihovog polugodisnjega izvjestaja:**

*• $2.4 billion funding committed to one of the world's largest greenfield lithium projects, subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences and ongoing engagement with local communities, the Government of Serbia and civil society.*

*• To be built to the highest environmental standards, including utilising dry stacking of tailings, with no need for a tailings dam. Approximately 70% of raw water to come from recycled sources or treated mine water.*

*• Expected to operate in the first quartile of the cost curve for both products, with a 40-year mine life.*

*• First saleable production in 2026 at a time of strong market fundamentals with lithium demand forecast to grow 25-35% per year over the next decade.*

*• Following ramp-up to to full production in 2029, the mine is expected produce \~58,000 tonnes of batterygrade lithium carbonate, 160,000 tonnes of boric acid (B2O3 units) and 255,000 tonnes of sodium sulphate annually.*

*• Positions Rio Tinto as the largest source of lithium supply in Europe. Jadar could supply enough lithium to power over one million electric vehicles per year.*

**Nesto dalje u izvjestaju:**

*Jadar will be a significant investment for Serbia and has the potential to make a 1% direct and 4% indirect contribution to the country’s GDP, with many Serbian suppliers being involved in the construction of the mine. We are committed to help develop local businesses so that they can support the operation over the coming decades. It will also be a significant employer, creating 2,100 jobs during construction and 1,000 mining and processing jobs once in production.*

Economists say Labor has a realistic chance of posting a shock third budget surplus as soaring tax revenue delivers Treasurer Jim Chalmers a $14.5 billion windfall that could allow the government to promote its economic credentials or spend more cash during the election campaign.
Booming income tax from a strong jobs market and a weak Australian dollar that is turbocharging company taxes on US dollar-priced commodity exports have halved the budget deficit, according to Department of Finance figures. The deficit in the five months to November 30 was $14 billion, versus an expected deficit of $28.5 billion to that point in the year.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers on the pre-election campaign in Queensland this week. Nine News
Budgets typically start the early months of the fiscal year in deficit and move towards surplus as more tax revenue flows through in later months approaching the June 30 financial year-end. Former Treasury economists say the full-year deficit is on track to be much smaller than the $26.9 billion deficit estimated in the December budget update, with a surplus a realistic possibility based on the current trajectory.
The surprise turnaround will provide an opportunity for Dr Chalmers to trumpet Labor’s financial management as the party approaches an election due by May 17 and could give it more flexibility to spend on new promises to woo voters.
Canberra-based Outlook Economics director Peter Downes said the budget was heading for another windfall and a surplus was within reach in 2024-25 if the current economic trends persisted for the next six months.

“If the unemployment rate has a 3 in front of it, the iron ore price is still around $US100 a tonne and the exchange rate is still around US62¢, then there will probably be a surplus,” Mr Downes told AFR Weekend.
“That’s assuming they don’t go on an election spending binge, and the election promises will probably mainly be [after this financial year] for 2025-26 onwards.”

The Coalition and some economists have criticised Labor’s rise in spending, such as a $26 billion blowout in aged care, disability, medicines and childcare costs compared with its maiden budget, as The Australian Financial Reviewreported this week.
But the unprecedented revenue windfalls from an extra 1 million workers paying income taxes and high commodity export prices have been even larger than the additional outlays.
Total budget revenue is cumulatively more than $380 billion higher over five years compared with Treasury’s forecasts on the eve of the May 2022 election, economist Chris Richardson calculates.

Much of the election spending, such as the $7.2 billion pledged by the prime minister for the Bruce Highway in Queensland this week, will be for future years over the longer term and will not affect this year’s budget outcome.
Asked about the prospect of a stronger budget this year and the possibility of a third surplus, Dr Chalmers said on Friday that responsible budget and economic management had been a hallmark of the Albanese government’s first term.
‘Lot of volatility’
“We delivered back-to-back surpluses in our first two years and almost halved the deficit we inherited in our third,” he said.
“The budget position is already $200 billion better than at the last election, debt’s down $177 billion and that means we’re paying less interest on it in the years ahead.
“There’s a lot of volatility in the global economy playing out here but we haven’t seen anything that would materially change the estimates from a month ago.”

A much smaller deficit or third surplus would boost Labor’s fiscal credentials in an election campaign, although the final budget result won’t be known until after the election and the June 30 year-end.
The Coalition leads Labor on a two-party-preferred basis by 51 per cent to 49 per cent, which would put Labor into minority government, according to The Australian Financial Review/Freshwater Strategy poll in December. The Coalition leads Labor as the best party to manage the economy.
In the five months ended November 30, taxes drawn from companies, individuals, superannuation and goods and services were all higher than anticipated in the May budget.
Personal income tax payments are running $7.6 billion higher due to the unemployment rate being a low 3.9 per cent, boosted by strong female participation in the care economy. A strong sharemarket has pushed up superannuation taxes by $1.8 billion and company tax collections are tracking $400 million higher. GST collections, which are passed on to the states and territories, are $1.6 billion higher than expected.
Total expenses in the first five months of the financial year were $3 billion lower than forecast, largely due to lower grants to the states.
Westpac economist Pat Bustamante said the fiscal result to the end of November showed luck continued to shine on the budget.

“Stronger than expected labour income and company profits have seen tax collections track ahead of expectations,” he said.
“Going forward, the falling Australian dollar will boost Aussie-denominated profits for exporters, providing some further upside.”
Labour shortages
Mr Bustamante also noted that some payments, such as grants and subsidies for infrastructure projects, were lower than expected, perhaps as a result of labour shortages pushing out project milestones.
“Should these dynamics continue, a third consecutive surplus is a possibility but will depend on how the government manages its finances over the remainder of the fiscal year,” he said.
Mr Downes and Mr Bustamante, both former Treasury forecasters, were two of the first private sector economists to tip the budget to shift from deep deficits during the pandemic to a surprise surplus in 2022-23.

The $22.1 billion surplus delivered by Labor was the first since Liberals John Howard and Peter Costello were in power 15 years earlier.
Dr Chalmers delivered a second surplus of $15.8 billion in 2023-24.
Weak Aussie dollar boosts budget
The Department of Finance figures to the end of November were published on its website the day before Christmas, but the marked improvement has not previously been reported.
The government’s separate mid-year budget published a week earlier on December 18 appears to have been overly conservative on revenue forecasts in the near term compared with the actual revenue inflows so far.
Treasury’s forecasts will be updated in a scheduled March 25 budget, if an election hasn’t already been called by then, or in the official Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook to be published within 10 days of the election being called.

The slump in the Australian dollar, which dipped below US62¢ on Friday, boosts national income and government tax revenue.
The local currency is about 3.5 per cent lower on a trade-weighted index (TWI) basis than forecast by Treasury.
A 5 per cent lower TWI boosts the federal budget by about $11 billion in a year.
Major commodity exports, including iron ore, coal and gas, are priced in US dollars, delivering higher Australian dollar returns to miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto, and higher corporate tax payments.
The higher national income also flows through to higher prices and a bigger revenue base for income tax and GST.

""Canada’s former ambassador to China will not face a federal ethics  probe into his joining mining giant Rio Tinto while finishing his  diplomatic posting.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s office confirmed to Global News  Monday that Dominic Barton, who served as Ottawa’s man in Beijing from  Sept. 2019 until last month, will not face an investigation over  accepting a job on Rio Tinto’s board.

“(Barton) did not have direct and significant dealings with  Rio Tinto while he was Canada’s Ambassador in China. This was discussed  with the commissioner prior to Mr. Barton’s pursuit of employment,”  wrote Melanie Rushworth, a spokesperson for Dion’s office in a statement  to Global News.

Rushworth said Barton, a former chief executive  of international consulting firm McKinsey, contacted Dion’s office in  October 2021 to “seek specific guidance in respect of post-employment  pursuits.” Barton disclosed an Oct. 8 meeting with representatives from  Rio Tinto at that time.""

7' Good chance for USMNT but batted away by the Honduras keeper. USA corner. Header just wide. 

10' Some good wide play from the United States, once again the cross is over hit.

10' [](//#yellow) Honduras's Espinoza pulled down, the foul needed to happen. Yellow for Jermaine Jones. 

11' Wall does it's job on the free kick given for the pull down.

13' Honduras really pressuring and perhaps have had the better start

15' USA win another corner, foul in the box. 

17' GREAT EFFORT FROM EDDIE JOHNSON! Awesome cross but the shot is well saved.

18' US looking good, pouring on the pressure. Corners and crosses that, if they find the target, have been causing lots of damage.

18' Dempsey has a great chance, but his header just does not have the power. Great ball from Michael Bradley. On second look, Dempsey may not have had a touch.

19' Taking a breather after the US pressure. Hope everyone's having a good evening. 

20' Momentum has swung in favor of the US and they are holding the ball well.

22' Awkward sideline commentary is awkward.

22' Jozy Altidore cutting and swerving, but Honduras holding. However, their advances going the opposite direction have been faulty, running it out of bounds. 

24' Foul by Eddie Johnson, Honduras defense holding well. 

26' Yeah Jack Mac getting a mention on ESPN! Shoutout to Philadelphia Union fans watching this thread!

28' US looking a bit disjointed in attack giving passes away, fouling, etc. Altidore recieves a warning for a challenge he made. 

28' Dangerous misunderstanding between Beasler and Howard, but Beasler's header makes it to Howard.

29' Andy Najar has a promising opportunity for Honduras and runs it out of play.

31' Injury for Carlo Costly, that injury could be... costly. He's been taken off and Honduras will play with ten men for the time being.

32' Neither team has found their rhythm Ian.... 

33' Free kick to Honduras in USMNT half

33' [](//#sub) **Substitution (Honduras): Roger Rojas IN FOR Carlo Costly**

41' Isagere with a well struck shot from the far side across the net, but it goes wide.

42' ESPN feed breaking up a bit.

43' Inching towards halftime... US corner kick now, their fifth

43' Short corner and it breaks down. I don't like short corners, they didn't even get a cross in.

44' Good wide play from the US, but Honduras hard to break down. 

45' Really good play from Najar, but instead of passing, chooses to shoot and Howard makes a strong save. Corner. 

45' + 1' Corner knocked out to the side and the US recover. 

45' + 2' Slow crawl to halftime. 

------
**HALF TIME**

United States 0 - 0 Honduras

Klinsmann's message: Higher tempo, break Honduras down.

46' Everyone got their snacks?

47' Honduras build off a giveaway, but it comes to nothing.

49' I've armed myself with some more match thread knowledge, icons! Slow start to the second half.

51' Najar earns a corner for Honduras. Over everyone.

53' Nice shove in the back from a Honduras player that wasn't called. Ball was going out anyway.

55' Shove from Palacios that earns the US a free kick in the Honduras half (about halfway in)

56' Free kick enters the box and gives Brad Evans a GREAT chance at a header but it bounces into the Honduras keeper's hands. 

58' Corner for Honduras bounces around dangerously, eventually out of the box and back in, right to Howard.

59' [](//#whistle) OFFSIDE on Jozy Altidore, he is just offside after a through ball from Dempsey.

60' We've reached an hour with no breakthrough.

61' Ball given away to Espinosa and Honduras, but it peters out again... 

62' Eddie Johnson taken down in the box. No penalty. However, a corner is given, even though it should be a goal kick. Nothing results from the corner however.

63' What just happened. I will try to describe best I can. Zusi with a long swerving run into the box, and his cross from the endline hits the post and bounces around. Hits a hand in the kerfuffle (wow, that's actually a word according to this) and perhaps Honduras gets away with one. The handball wasn't deliberate per se, but had the ref saw that (or another ref), it may have been given. 

65' Wow the fans in Chicago... that's pretty cool! 

66' Push on Mario Martinez earning Honduras a free kick from about 25-30 yards.

67' Hit by Martinez... Over.

68' Dempsey with a lovely strike from 30 yards, or at least it looked it as the ball went 5-10 yards wide.

Economists say Labor has a realistic chance of posting a shock third budget surplus as soaring tax revenue delivers Treasurer Jim Chalmers a $14.5 billion windfall that could allow the government to promote its economic credentials or spend more cash during the election campaign.
Booming income tax from a strong jobs market and a weak Australian dollar that is turbocharging company taxes on US dollar-priced commodity exports have halved the budget deficit, according to Department of Finance figures. The deficit in the five months to November 30 was $14 billion, versus an expected deficit of $28.5 billion to that point in the year.

Budgets typically start the early months of the fiscal year in deficit and move towards surplus as more tax revenue flows through in later months approaching the June 30 financial year-end. Former Treasury economists say the full-year deficit is on track to be much smaller than the $26.9 billion deficit estimated in the December budget update, with a surplus a realistic possibility based on the current trajectory.
The surprise turnaround will provide an opportunity for Dr Chalmers to trumpet Labor’s financial management as the party approaches an election due by May 17 and could give it more flexibility to spend on new promises to woo voters.
Canberra-based Outlook Economics director Peter Downes said the budget was heading for another windfall and a surplus was within reach in 2024-25 if the current economic trends persisted for the next six months.

“If the unemployment rate has a 3 in front of it, the iron ore price is still around $US100 a tonne and the exchange rate is still around US62¢, then there will probably be a surplus,” Mr Downes told AFR Weekend.
“That’s assuming they don’t go on an election spending binge, and the election promises will probably mainly be [after this financial year] for 2025-26 onwards.”

The Coalition and some economists have criticised Labor’s rise in spending, such as a $26 billion blowout in aged care, disability, medicines and childcare costs compared with its maiden budget, as The Australian Financial Review reported this week.
But the unprecedented revenue windfalls from an extra 1 million workers paying income taxes and high commodity export prices have been even larger than the additional outlays.
Total budget revenue is cumulatively more than $380 billion higher over five years compared with Treasury’s forecasts on the eve of the May 2022 election, economist Chris Richardson calculates.
Much of the election spending, such as the $7.2 billion pledged by the prime minister for the Bruce Highway in Queensland this week, will be for future years over the longer term and will not affect this year’s budget outcome.
Asked about the prospect of a stronger budget this year and the possibility of a third surplus, Dr Chalmers said on Friday that responsible budget and economic management had been a hallmark of the Albanese government’s first term.
‘Lot of volatility’
“We delivered back-to-back surpluses in our first two years and almost halved the deficit we inherited in our third,” he said.
“The budget position is already $200 billion better than at the last election, debt’s down $177 billion and that means we’re paying less interest on it in the years ahead.
“There’s a lot of volatility in the global economy playing out here but we haven’t seen anything that would materially change the estimates from a month ago.”
A much smaller deficit or third surplus would boost Labor’s fiscal credentials in an election campaign, although the final budget result won’t be known until after the election and the June 30 year-end.
The Coalition leads Labor on a two-party-preferred basis by 51 per cent to 49 per cent, which would put Labor into minority government, according to The Australian Financial Review/Freshwater Strategy poll in December. The Coalition leads Labor as the best party to manage the economy.
In the five months ended November 30, taxes drawn from companies, individuals, superannuation and goods and services were all higher than anticipated in the May budget.
Personal income tax payments are running $7.6 billion higher due to the unemployment rate being a low 3.9 per cent, boosted by strong female participation in the care economy. A strong sharemarket has pushed up superannuation taxes by $1.8 billion and company tax collections are tracking $400 million higher. GST collections, which are passed on to the states and territories, are $1.6 billion higher than expected.
Total expenses in the first five months of the financial year were $3 billion lower than forecast, largely due to lower grants to the states.
Westpac economist Pat Bustamante said the fiscal result to the end of November showed luck continued to shine on the budget.
“Stronger than expected labour income and company profits have seen tax collections track ahead of expectations,” he said.
“Going forward, the falling Australian dollar will boost Aussie-denominated profits for exporters, providing some further upside.”
Labour shortages
Mr Bustamante also noted that some payments, such as grants and subsidies for infrastructure projects, were lower than expected, perhaps as a result of labour shortages pushing out project milestones.
“Should these dynamics continue, a third consecutive surplus is a possibility but will depend on how the government manages its finances over the remainder of the fiscal year,” he said.
Mr Downes and Mr Bustamante, both former Treasury forecasters, were two of the first private sector economists to tip the budget to shift from deep deficits during the pandemic to a surprise surplus in 2022-23.
The $22.1 billion surplus delivered by Labor was the first since Liberals John Howard and Peter Costello were in power 15 years earlier.
Dr Chalmers delivered a second surplus of $15.8 billion in 2023-24.
Weak Aussie dollar boosts budget
The Department of Finance figures to the end of November were published on its website the day before Christmas, but the marked improvement has not previously been reported.
The government’s separate mid-year budget published a week earlier on December 18 appears to have been overly conservative on revenue forecasts in the near term compared with the actual revenue inflows so far.
Treasury’s forecasts will be updated in a scheduled March 25 budget, if an election hasn’t already been called by then, or in the official Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook to be published within 10 days of the election being called.
The slump in the Australian dollar, which dipped below US62¢ on Friday, boosts national income and government tax revenue.
The local currency is about 3.5 per cent lower on a trade-weighted index (TWI) basis than forecast by Treasury.
A 5 per cent lower TWI boosts the federal budget by about $11 billion in a year.
Major commodity exports, including iron ore, coal and gas, are priced in US dollars, delivering higher Australian dollar returns to miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto, and higher corporate tax payments.
The higher national income also flows through to higher prices and a bigger revenue base for income tax and GST.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:57.767185,2025-01-10T20:30:13,Rio Tinto,2025

This week’s $600m federal and Queensland government [bailout of Glencore’s Mount Isa copper smelter](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/glencores-mount-isa-copper-smelter-faces-closure-despite-600m-rescue-deal/news-story/e2bec42e7d2c1326a448658de3b70761) and Townsville refinery is again bleeding the taxpayer to keep a dying business on life support. In this case, for at least another three years supposedly, as long as the Anglo-Swiss multinational can come up with a plan to fix the [two ailing facilities](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/glencore-ceo-nagle-defends-miners-commitment-to-australia/news-story/28b9220476aeedacf246db601289e3b3) and develop industry in the remote northwest of the state.

If past experience is our guide, this “short-term lifeline”, as Glencore calls the latest gift in a long line of handouts, probably spells more good taxpayer money after bad, all on credit. Welcome to Bailout Nation.

With an estimated $152bn in cash deficits and $85bn in “off-budget” cash outflows from investments over the four-year budget cycle, Canberra will be [borrowing from the future](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/voters-are-switching-on-to-the-perils-of-debt-and-deficits/news-story/97fecb6d0d58fd52537c4b02a0bbbca0) to fund this escapade. Remember, someone has to pay, be it via higher taxes, offsetting spending cuts or higher interest rates. This is how the world works; a leg-up for some is a cost borne by many.

[With 94 seats in his kick](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/its-time-to-refresh-our-pragmatic-patriotism/news-story/af6f2e55e30ac84a584886ee7842ddb0), you may think Anthony Albanese does not have to indulge in such excesses, which look for all the world like the failed enterprise that was Bidenomics; its centrepiece and grandiose Inflation Reduction Act neither cutting consumer price growth nor leading to the revival of manufacturing employment and output promised by its deluded backers.

Rent seekers and their lobbying muscle are on the prowl in Canberra and state capitals in the era of Labor’s Future Made in Australia program. If you’re seeking a fistful of dollars or a tax break, merely sprinkling the term “productivity” isn’t going to cut it these days. “Clean energy” and “resilience” may perk up a weary official on a bad hair day.

Glencore claimed the outback smelter was losing a ton of money. Picture: Glencore

But the real coin among the federal capital’s executive class is generated by making the case for “national security”, “a strategic national asset”, “self-reliance” and “critical minerals”. That last term will be working overtime for Team Australia during the Prime Minister’s mercy dash to meet Donald Trump at the White House on October 20.

In August, Nyrstar secured a [$135m rescue deal](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/critical-minerals-transformation-across-two-key-smelters-a-boost-for-sovereign-capacity/news-story/7d98f52ff4bed2d833efb49d345bf31f) for its Hobart zinc and Port Pirie lead smelters, with the lion’s share of funding from the federal and South Australian governments, and one-sixth from Tasmania. The package was presented as a critical minerals bonanza, to produce antimony and bismuth (in SA) and germanium and indium in Tasmania.

According to Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres, these minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology.

In February, Albanese had pledged $2.4bn to prop up the Whyalla steelworks. It was a day after SA Premier Peter Malinauskas seized control of [Sanjeev Gupta’s operations](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/peter-malinauskass-bermuda-triangle-of-funding-to-blow-huge-hole-in-budget/news-story/5c81a0b99e6aa4b5865503a8b430674a) on the Eyre Peninsula and placed it in administration.

As well, the Rio Tinto-owned Tomago aluminium smelter in the NSW Hunter region, the [nation’s largest energy user](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/agl-energy-delivers-grim-reality-check-on-tomago-aluminium-smelter/news-story/cf2caace781ac2510b029f4d6a25f5d9), also has been in talks with state and federal officials, reportedly seeking billions in assistance. As Dolly might put, “here you come again”.

Glencore, listed on the London stock exchange, is the world’s largest coal producer; it employs 150,000 workers but is going through a $US1bn ($1.5bn) cost-cutting drive. The company’s share price is down 15 per cent over the past year, but the outlook for copper has improved despite various production snarls.

While negotiating with the two governments during the past eight months, Glencore claimed the outback smelter was losing a ton of money. Glencore has projected [$2.2bn in operational losses](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/speculation-600m-deal-over-three-years-needed-to-save-glencore-copper-smelter/news-story/ac91c2a2bfb602186b59210f099fcf4d) across the seven years to 2031 because of a drop in the charges other companies pay to have their products processed. As well, there’s a global glut of smelting capacity, largely in China and India, and a shortage of copper concentrates.

“The competition in the global smelting market is fierce and it’s not a level playing field with countries trying to take strategic positions in the market,” said Troy Wilson, the interim chief operating officer of Glencore’s local metals business. “It is our hope that conditions improve over the next three years to a point where government assistance is no longer necessary.”

Naturally, as is the way of these handouts under Labor’s industrial adventure, and sub-par transition to cleaner energy, Ayres glammed it up as an “investment” in industrial capacity and to “protect” 600 jobs. “Copper is critical to building solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage systems,” Ayres said.

“This investment strengthens our supply chains and supports Australia’s transition to net zero. If Australia didn’t already have established facilities like the Mount Isa copper smelter, we’d be looking to build them to protect Australia’s industrial capability, and strengthen the capability needed for (the) future.”

We’re in a bleak era of [rampant protectionism](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/us-presidents-troubles-come-cheap-but-will-leave-expensive/news-story/f6ea836799e8cf686506f2acb5419692), where self-harm is the ardour of the day. It did not start on January 20 this year but, as in so many spheres of activity, Trump Unbound has been a force multiplier. Just days before the US President was sworn in, the International Monetary Fund warned tariffs and subsidies “rarely improve domestic prospects durably” and might leave “every country worse off”.

Last year Productivity Commission chairwoman [Danielle Wood warned](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/future-made-in-australia-productivity-commissions-danielle-wood-reveals-hidden-cost-of-anthony-albaneses-future/news-story/690e34b972e07355d92728ad7e569112) that unless government assistance had a well-defined exit strategy, Labor’s signature industry policy risked building a class of businesses dependent on forever subsidies.

“For industries that are not able to stand on their own two feet in competing globally, more money will be needed for every year we choose to ‘rent’ the industry,” Wood told Inquirer in April last year. “We will see a whole class of businesses whose livelihoods depend on ongoing support, which will have an incentive to spend a lot of time and ­resources ensuring that the tap is not turned off.

“To make sure that new supports make sense, we would encourage the government to be very clear in specifying their policy objectives. Understanding whether we are trying to reduce supply-chain risks, speed up the green transition or create jobs is needed to help evaluate whether the policies stack up.”

Minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology. Picture: Glencore

To ensure Labor’s industry policy had effective guardrails, Treasury developed a [National Interest Framework](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/labor-future-made-in-australia-tense-amid-bill-impasse/news-story/443198f54611b83032a0eb0185e62f2c), a set of hoops projects needed to go through before qualifying for public funding. There are two streams, one supporting net zero, the other economic resilience and security. Is there any evidence these guardrails are anything more than the flimsy high-vis plastic barriers councils erect around local works?

Given Australia’s new world of trade and strategic threats, and inevitable policy tensions between financial prosperity and national security, former Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has spoken about adapting Australia’s successful model of economic and social progress.

“But it also needs to maintain the conventional economic considerations of budget constraints, trade-offs and cost-benefit analysis,” Kennedy, now secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said in May. As former economic adviser to Barack Obama Jason Furman has argued, those wise conventions went missing in action under Joe Biden’s wayward administration in a “post-neoliberal delusion”.

A year earlier in an [address to the US Studies Centre](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/treasury-secretary-steven-kennedy-backs-strong-guardrails-for-made-in-australia-plan/news-story/6d667310b89ba4ade82850f100332ca2?btr=2f0e5e70b3860afd2a4ffb446a60e2fd), echoing the PC’s Wood (and a chorus line of her predecessors), Kennedy noted there was a “heightened risk” that inefficient industries would be propped up by taxpayers if government interventions aimed at building economic resilience were poorly targeted. In the event of another global disruption, Kennedy advised, we needed to build up other trusted sources of supply.

Explaining Labor’s push to establish protections around key parts of the economy, Kennedy referenced the “small yard, high fence” strategy. He noted the “immense pressure that policymakers are under to expand the ‘yard’.” Well, here we go again, and Albo is flashing the national credit card.

There’s little doubt high energy costs and workplace re-regulation are putting the squeeze on metals producers. BlueScope chief executive Mark Vassella is leading a group that is negotiating with the federal government to control the Whyalla steelworks.

He told the National Press Club on Wednesday that because markets had been distorted by countries such as China, “you run the risk of industry appearing to be uneconomic”. Simply arguing the technocrats’ naive view of “let the market decide”, Vassella claimed, was “a slippery slope that I wouldn’t want to see us on”.

Yet bailout after bailout, we’re stumbling headlong into a money pit; amid a slag heap of woe, surrounded by a battered old fence, our baleful yard is gathering noxious weeds and rusty junk.

Australia’s latest $600m industrial rescue package dwarfs previous bailouts and is creating a class of mendicants that can’t stand on their own feet.

- In a post on social media platform Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump said the latest setback to Arizona's Resolution Copper mine would impact thousands of jobs at a time when the world's largest economy ""quite simply, needs Copper — AND NOW!""

- His comments came shortly after he met the chief executives of Rio Tinto and BHP at the White House, alongside Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

- Two of the world's largest mining firms, Rio Tinto and BHP have been trying to develop the Arizona copper project together for roughly two decades, but the procedures have been beset by legal issues.

- The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday issued a temporary restraining order to prevent a land transfer while the court considers challenges that have been brought by opponents including the San Carlos Apache Tribe, which is seeking to block the project over religious, cultural and environmental reasons.

- ""It is so sad that Radical Left Activists can do this, and affect the lives of so many people. Those that fought it are Anti-American, and representing other Copper competitive Countries,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

- Resolution Copper described the Monday ruling as ""merely a temporary pause,"" adding it was confident the court would ultimately affirm the necessary land transfer.

- ""This proposed mine is a rip-off, will destroy a sacred area, decimates our environment, threatens our water rights, and is bad for America,"" Terry Rambler, chairman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, said in a Facebook post.

- Addressing Trump's Truth Social post on the recent court ruling, Rambler said the U.S. president's comments ""mirror misinformation that has been repeated by foreign mining interests that want to extract American copper.""

- He added that he was willing to meet with the Trump administration to help ""protect American interests.""

- The Arizona copper project is a proposed underground mine roughly 60 miles east of Phoenix, close to the the town of Superior. The joint venture is 55% owned by Rio Tinto and 45% by BHP.

- Resolution Copper says the ore deposit represents ""one of the most significant untapped copper deposits today"" and estimates the potential for the project to add $1 billion a year to Arizona's economy.

- A highly conducive metal, copper is a critical component to virtually everything in the modern economy, from solar panels and wind turbines to defense applications and artificial intelligence infrastructure.

- Demand for copper is expected to skyrocket over the coming years, dramatically outstripping supply amid the energy transition.

- In a LinkedIn post, BHP CEO Mike Henry thanked Trump and Burgum for ""for their strong leadership to reinvigorate mining and processing supply chains in and for America.""

- Alongside Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm and the company's incoming CEO Simon Trott, BHP's Henry said they met with Trump and Burgum to underscore the firm's commitment to develop Resolution Copper.

- The U.S. produces only about 5% of the world's copper, according to Dutch bank ING and has seen a 20% decline in production over the last decade. Building new mines in the country, meanwhile, can take a considerable amount of time due to a lengthy permitting process.

- Trump recently surprised markets by exempting refined metals from tariffs on copper products. The U.S. president initially touted copper tariffs of 50% as part of an effort to boost domestic production and reduce the country's reliance on imports.

- In a pared-back announcement thereafter, however, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff on copper pipes and wiring from Aug. 1, leaving out copper ores, concentrates and cathodes.

- More than half of global copper reserves are said to be located in just five countries — Chile, Australia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Russia.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:45:57.768130,2025-08-21T00:18:42,Rio Tinto,2025

September 11 2025 - 4:35pm

How is it that one of our most beloved institutions, the Australian National University, is so poorly run?

How is it that we discover, a minute into the new vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell’s tenure that hundreds of staff would need to be sacked? Courses cancelled. Research abandoned.

Let me tell you how.

The governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone.

The governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction.

The good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act.

Bell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent.

Between the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal?

The speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere.

She’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted.

But as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell.

There are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university.

This is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility.

And a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person.

That may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster.

The problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells.

“There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy.

She is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project.

Hendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out.

Hendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \[The university’s own change management process\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.”

The ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.

“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.

Right now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.

One of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.

“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.

“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”

Can Bishop oversee meaningful change? Now that’s a story for a few months down the track.

We all know sentiment to nuclear and uranium has been shifting slowly, but bans on uranium mining still exist in some jurisdictions. Sweden looks set to bet the first mover in this space, and I believe Western Australia (WA) will be next to make this change in late 2026.

**Political Situation**

For the non-Aussies, Australia's political system is basically a two-party system, dominated currently by:

* ALP: Australian Labour Party (left leaning)
* LNP: A coalition of The Liberal Party and The National Party (right leaning)

At a federal level the ALP are the incumbent government, having fought off the pro-nuclear LNP at the recent federal election in 2025.

There was also a state election in Western Australia in early 2025 where the incumbent state ALP retained power from the pro uranium-mining LNP.

At face value, this seems like there's no chance of the uranium mining ban in WA being lifted, right? ALP in power, anti-nuclear, anti-uranium. What hope is there?

Australia currently has 3 operating uranium mines, all located in South Australia:

* Olympic Dam (BHP \~8Mlb/yr)
* Four Mile (Heathgate \~4.7Mlb/yr)
* Honeymoon (Boss Energy \~1.6Mlb/yr).

The current state government in South Australia is ALP and their leader has made numerous positive comments about nuclear, uranium mining and AUKUS (deal with UK and US to build nuclear submarines in Australia). This is not a party stance, it is driven by certain people within the ALP. Even former ALP Prime Minister Bob Hawke has been vocally pro nuclear.

In Australia, mining is a state controlled issue.

State political terms are 4 years. The next Western Australian election will be in 2029, more on the relevance of this later.



**What about federal interference?**

The federal environmental minister can pull rank, and recently did cancelling a [gold mine](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/mining-lobby-says-plibersek-intervention-imperils-1b-gold-project-20240818-p5k3ca) because it had Traditional Owner opposition. So are the ALP just left leaning crackpots that will interfere with all mining? Absolutely not! Four coal mines were recently approved and so was a massive gas extension that would take the project out well past their goal of being net zero by 2050. Mining is the backbone of the Australian economy, the 5 largest exports, all minerals, account for 62.6% of all exports in 2024.



**Traditional Owner Risk?**

For those unfamiliar with Australia's past, and this is probably news to even some Aussies, there are \~250 different 'national' Indigenous Australians groups. They do not all think and act the same, there are distinct languages and even dialects within regions, between regions they disagree on many issues. Whilst some will fight all mining, others will happily work with mining for the job opportunities in the community (and the royalties...). 

Build positive relationships and this is no different to Canadian or US miners working with traditional owners over there. Something that needs to be considered, but not impossible.   


**History of Uranium Mining in Western Australia**

2002, the Western Australian Labor Government banned uranium mining in the State due to environmental and safety concerns, community fear and questions over its economic viability. However, exploration was allowed to continue.

Six years later, the ban on uranium mining was overturned by Western Australia’s newly elected Liberal Government in 2008. This decision also followed the Federal Government’s decision to abandon the ‘no new mines’ policy. Following the lifting of the ban, four projects were approved in WA: Wiluna (Toro Energy), Kintyre (Cameco), Mulga Rock (Vimy/Deep Yellow) and Yeelirrie (Cameco).

In 2017, Labor returned to Government, and in fulfilment of an election promise, implemented a “no uranium” condition on future mining leases, but allowed the four approved projects to proceed if they met certain conditions within five years. This included demonstrating “substantial commencement” of their plans on site.

In 2022, only one of the four projects, [Mulga Rock](https://deepyellow.com.au/projects/australia/mulga-rock-project/approvals-and-compliance/) (Vimy at the time, acquired by Deep Yellow), received notice that “substantial commencement” had been achieved and was able to proceed. Mulga Rock is currently undertaking a revised Definitive Feasibility Study (due Q3 2026) to optimise project parameters by including critical mineral recovery optimisation work, detailed resource definition drilling and mining studies. The other 3 projects either failed to meet the deadline or requested an extension.

NOTE: this is not a legislated ban, it is a policy of the incumbent government not to issue a mining license to a uranium project. This is a VERY easy change.



**Western Australian Economy**

In Western Australia everyone either works in the mining industry, work in an adjacent industry that supplies something to the mining industry, directly benefits from people with mining industry money spending their rock cash, is related to someone in the mining industry or is having sex with someone in the mining industry.

TLDR: 52% of Western Australia's exports are from iron ore alone.

Why is this significant?

https://preview.redd.it/rvysqif958qf1.png?width=1718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d11d4f27ed847ead6cc70f0bebadb708a7d6903e

The Iron Ore price, and therefore taxes/royalty revenue for the state coffers is down. To top this off Rio Tinto is about to start up the Simandu iron ore mine in Papua New Guinea, dubbed ""[the Pilbara killer](https://www.mining.com/aussie-dollar-climbing-is-the-iron-ore-trade-back-on/)"" (Pilbara is the region in Western Australia known for mining/iron ore).



**Western Australia Uranium**

Globally, Australia has the largest amount of uranium resources, with approximately 1,684,100 tonnes (shit loads of this is in the 2,000Mlb beast Olympic Dam). Western Australia alone has known deposits of about 226,000 tonnes, which would place it as the eighth largest uranium resource in the world.



**Social and Political Change is Happening**

The [Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA](https://cciwa.com/policy-submission/uranium-mining-in-western-australia/) has been very vocal about Western Australia overturning the uranium mining ban\*\*.\*\*

Nuclear and by association uranium is about to become a lot more socially normalised in Western Australia with the US Navy already advertising (possibly posting?) nuclear engineers in Western Australia for the new [Henderson Defence Precinct](https://www.minister.defence.gov.au/media-releases/2025-09-14/additional-defence-funding-deliver-henderson-defence-precinct) as part of AUKUS

A recent [poll](https://world-nuclear-news.org/articles/western-australians-support-lifting-uranium-ban-poll-finds) (smallish, biased organiser) found 57% of respondents supported uranium mining in Western Australia.



**The Kicker**

Western Australia is going to get a uranium mine, even with the current policy not to issue 'new' mining licenses.

As previously noted Mulga Rock achieved 'substantial commencement' by digging a hole for early site works, this was enough to get the go ahead before the deadline. However, Deep Yellow acquired Vimy Resources and Mr Uranium (John Borshoff) saw an opportunity to further develop Mulga Rock.

Deep Yellow have completed additional resource expansion increasing the Mulga Rock East deposit from 56.7Mlb to 71.2Mlb, with 39.6Mlb of that in proven and probable reserves. There is an additional 33.6Mlb at Mulga Rock West.

In addition to the resource expansion they have turned this project into a polymetallic mine and are currently doing pilot test work on a beneficiation process which has shown early test capacity to upgraded the ore feed from 662ppm to 1698ppm.

The revised DFS was originally planned for Q4 2025, however has been pushed out to Q3 2026. Deep Yellow are currently sitting on their hands delaying FID for their Tumas project in Namibia due to the current uranium price, so capital to develop both projects in close timelines may be a challenge to raise.



**The Opportunity**

The WA premier, Roger Cook, recently requested an [Inquiry into the role of Western Australia in the global effort on decarbonisation](https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Parliament/commit.nsf/(EvidenceOnly)/2AB1C5D5620D2C0348258CED000FC147?opendocument#ToR)

The Committee is to consider and make recommendations on:

1. The pathways our **major trading partners** have to decarbonising and the potential for Western Australia to contribute through: a) LNG exports, to provide energy security as they exit coal and transition to renewable energy. b) Blue and **green fuels**, such as hydrogen and ammonia. c) Green iron. d) The importance of carbon capture and storage to the above.

I have it on good authority that uranium will be accepted, as per the recent shifts globally in definition, as a green fuel for the purposes of this inquiry.

To reinforce this, today a [news article](https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/wa-premier-s-trade-mission-to-talk-green-steel-lng-and-uranium-20250918-p5mwak.html) came out with:

On the eve of an energy-focused trade mission to China and Japan, Premier Roger Cook has softened his language on the WA government’s uranium mining ban, saying it is “watching this space”.

The very first submission, from [Dr. Tim Crowe](https://www.thinkingnutrition.com.au/), is a case for why WA should remove the uranium ban. Tim is a top 20 shareholder of CXU. I will be making a submission too.

**Western Australia's Major Trading Partners**

1. China
2. Japan
3. South Korea

What are China, Japan and South Korea doing for decarbonsiation? Restarting and building loads of nuclear!



**The Opportunity Timelines**

* Date commenced: 21 Aug 2025
* Deadline for submissions: 10 Oct 2025
* Tabling date: 15 Aug 2026



**The Opportunity - Perfect Political Timing**

Earlier I mentioned the state political period is a 4 year term. Something like this risks becoming an election issue if the ban was changed too close to the next election (whinging by minor parties because the LNP opposition are also pro uranium mining anyway). This is why I believe the timing in 2026 is perfect politically to make the change; by 2029 at the next election it's completely forgotten about/something else is a bigger political issue to leverage.

**High Leverage Plays**

Cauldron Energy (CXU):

* Current Valuation: $26mil AUD
* CEO Jonathan Fisher, aka The Aussie Uranium Guy on X.
   * Background: the man that got traditional owner support to build a low level radioactive waste repository in Western Australia (Sandy Ridge - Tellus Holdings). People told him it couldn't be done... so he proved them wrong.
* Project: Yanrey - 41.7Mlb resource, ISR
   * Tenements surround Paladin Energy's Manyingee deposit - 41.5Mlb resource
* Recently signed non-binging MOU with Uzbek state ISR uranium miner Navoiuran (\~3rd largest producer in the world, more experienced than Kazatomprom)
* Play: take-over target post ban lifting?
* Note: drilling campaign about to start approx mid Oct on a new tenement acquired next to the main deposit which extends into that area.

Toro Energy (TOE):

* Current Valuation: $25mil AUD
* Executive Chairman: Richard Homsany
   * Gets a lot of heat for fumbling the substantial commencement opportunity, will take any opportunity at a conference or podcast to have a whinge about not being able to achieve substantial commencement because the deposit is at surface.
   * Many disgruntled (and vocal) shareholders on the register that have been destroyed by dilution.
   * May not have Toro Energy as his highest priority: He is Executive Chairman of ASX listed uranium exploration and development company Toro Energy Limited (ASX:TOE) and Executive Vice President, Australia of TSX listed uranium exploration company Mega Uranium Ltd (TSX:MGA) and the principal of Cardinals Lawyers and Consultants, a West Perth based corporate and resources law firm. Richard is also the Chairman of ASX listed copper exploration company Redstone Resources Limited (ASX:RDS) and TSX-V listed gold and iron ore explorer Central Iron Ore Limited (TSX-V:CIO). He is also Chairman of the Health Insurance Fund of Australia Ltd (HIF)
* Project: Wiluna - 84Mlb resource (200ppm cut-off)
   * VERY shallow deposit, kiddy shovel digging stuff. First few years of mining operations will apparently be very low cost.
   * Note: this is the resource for all deposits in the project, scoping study only uses 30.1Mlb with an initial target of 1.2Mlb/yr production.
   * Project is well advanced and could move quickly in a ban lifting situation, if they can secure MC growth and financing.



**Speculative Valuation**

https://preview.redd.it/gj290e0h34qf1.png?width=1372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f24e8c98b14c046b9775581f4ec17f91a529a4

A rerating to the $/lb of South Australian developer Alligator Energy\* at $7.7/lb would be a **13x for CXU** and **25x for TOE**.

\*note Alligator Energy has been underperforming, the actual outcome could be much higher than this, particularly with positive sector momentum layered on top of this. 

Thank you for coming to my wall of text.

Disclosure: recently bought a small parcel of CXU at $0.008 then got over subscription application for the entitlement offer at $0.006; also holding some CXUO.

**25.   The Obscure Cities: The Great Walls of Samaris** – Benoît Peeters &amp; François Schuiten - Kafka-meets-Art-Nouveau urban fantasy; meticulous architectural draftsmanship.

 

 

 

Bonus: here's what it came up with when I took the limits off current availability:

i.                         **Prophet: Remission** – Brandon Graham, Simon Roy et al - A conscious love-letter to Moebius and Druillet: sprawling alien biomes, chunky hand-lettering, and bio-tech grotesques—all inside a rebooted ’90s Image title.

ii.                       **Nocturnals: Black Planet** – **Dan Brereton -** Fully painted pulp-horror that feels like EC Comics drenched in Hammer-horror lighting; Brereton’s saturated palettes should click if you dig Templesmith’s mood pieces.

iii.                     **The Carnival of Immortals** – Bernard Yslaire - Operatic romance rendered in charcoal-heavy red &amp; black; a visual cousin to Bilal’s muted palettes.

iv.                     **Tekhnophobe** – Brendan McCarthy &amp; Tom Dezago- McCarthy liquifies pop psychedelia into cyber-organic nightmares—a missing link between *2000 AD* and Templesmith.

vii.                   **The Adventures of Luther Arkwright** – Bryan Talbot - Multiverse punk epic blending Beardsley penwork with psychedelic montage; proto–*Watchmen* density.

viii.                 **Big Numbers** \#1-2 – Alan Moore &amp; Bill Sienkiewicz → Al Columbia - Only two issues exist, but they’re a fever dream of urban-fractal storytelling; Columbia’s aborted #3 pages circulate as xeroxed ghosts.

ix.                     **Cobalt 60** – Vaughn Bodē &amp; Mark Bodē - Psychedelic post-apocalypse starring a reptilian avenger; heavy lined, Day-Glo palette.

x.                        **Godland** – Joe Casey &amp; Tom Scioli - Kirby krackle through a Frank Miller lens; Scioli’s faux-four-colour dots evoke *Heavy Metal* energy.

xi.                     **Fear Agent** (original B&amp;W magazine version) – Remender &amp; Opena - Grittier ink-only pilot predating the colour series; a rare look at Opena’s raw lines.

xii.                   **Phonogram: Rue Britannia** – Gillen &amp; McKelvie - Occult pop-music magic with minimalist line art; panels dance to Brit-pop beats.

xiii.                 **The Legend of Mother Sarah** – Katsuhiro Otomo (story) &amp; Takumi Nagayasu - Post-*Akira* Otomo world-building with Nagayasu’s cinematic inks; untranslated for years, now spottily scan-lated.

xiv.                 **Panorama of Hell** – Hideshi Hino - Grotesque body-horror autobiography; water-colour and scratchy pen in equal measure.

xv.                   **The Box Man** – Imiri Sakai - Silent faux-historical saga drawn in ball-point density—bridges Japanese gekiga and Euro BD sensibilities.

xvi.                 **A Land Called Tarot** – Gael Bertrand - Wordless high-fantasy labyrinths with fluorescent washes; every page a splash.

xvii.               **Island** anthology (issues #1-15) – Graham, Rios, Cloonan, et al. - Short-lived magazine that channeled *Métal Hurlant*; features now-uncollected shorts by Fiumara, Tran, Milonogiannis.

xviii.             **Night Business** – Benjamin Marra - VHS-sleaze vigilante action drawn in chunky 80s black-line; scarce self-published floppies.

xix.                 **Rusty Brown** (hardcover proto-strips, *Acme* \#16-19) – Chris Ware - Early fragments of Ware’s monumental graphic novel, printed oversized with experimental page mechanics.

xx.                    **The Trigan Empire** (Don Lawrence era, vol. 1-2) - Golden-Age matinee SF painted in gouache realism—Lawrence influenced Giménez and Gimenez influenced *Metabarons*.

xxi.                 **The Mercenary** – Vicente Segrelles - Fully-oil-painted dragons, sky-castles and glimmering armour—the fantasy cousin to Giménez’s chrome SF.

xxii.               **Giants** – Carlos Giménez - Satirical take on kaiju folklore through black-comedy cartooning; early example of Spanish “Nueva Ola” BD.

xxiii.             **Ship of Stone** – Pat Mills &amp; Clint Langley - Celtic myth wrapped in photographic-digital collage—prototype for *Slaine: The Books of Invasions*.

xxiv.             **King City (Tokyopop digest edition)** – Brandon Graham - Earlier, rawer printing with grey-wash halftones missing from Image reissue.

xxv.               **Domu: A Child’s Dream** – Katsuhiro Otomo - Pre-*Akira* psychic-horror novella; cinematic pacing, scarce in English now.

xxvi.             **Skull: The Slayer’s Acme Novelty Datebook #1** – James Stokoe - Hyper-detail kaiju pages in risograph colours; small-run printings vanish fast.

Job offer with Rio Tinto in Kitimat. Really decent salary ($30K more than what I am currently making). Relocation, housing assistance being provided, etc. 

I have only spent very limited time in the area about 5 years ago but was curious as to what anyone who has made the move out in recent years can tell me about living in the area. The need to knows. The good and the bad, etc. 

Also, for those who have worked at or still work at Rio Tinto, what your personal experiences are would be amazing! 

For context I am a straight 35 year old male and would be moving from Calgary. I love the outdoors and hiking, have a couple of dogs, not a big City guy really so a smaller town is really appealing to me.

This week’s $600m federal and Queensland government [bailout of Glencore’s Mount Isa copper smelter](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/glencores-mount-isa-copper-smelter-faces-closure-despite-600m-rescue-deal/news-story/e2bec42e7d2c1326a448658de3b70761) and Townsville refinery is again bleeding the taxpayer to keep a dying business on life support. In this case, for at least another three years supposedly, as long as the Anglo-Swiss multinational can come up with a plan to fix the [two ailing facilities](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/glencore-ceo-nagle-defends-miners-commitment-to-australia/news-story/28b9220476aeedacf246db601289e3b3) and develop industry in the remote northwest of the state.

If past experience is our guide, this “short-term lifeline”, as Glencore calls the latest gift in a long line of handouts, probably spells more good taxpayer money after bad, all on credit. Welcome to Bailout Nation.

With an estimated $152bn in cash deficits and $85bn in “off-budget” cash outflows from investments over the four-year budget cycle, Canberra will be [borrowing from the future](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/voters-are-switching-on-to-the-perils-of-debt-and-deficits/news-story/97fecb6d0d58fd52537c4b02a0bbbca0) to fund this escapade. Remember, someone has to pay, be it via higher taxes, offsetting spending cuts or higher interest rates. This is how the world works; a leg-up for some is a cost borne by many.

[With 94 seats in his kick](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/its-time-to-refresh-our-pragmatic-patriotism/news-story/af6f2e55e30ac84a584886ee7842ddb0), you may think Anthony Albanese does not have to indulge in such excesses, which look for all the world like the failed enterprise that was Bidenomics; its centrepiece and grandiose Inflation Reduction Act neither cutting consumer price growth nor leading to the revival of manufacturing employment and output promised by its deluded backers.

Rent seekers and their lobbying muscle are on the prowl in Canberra and state capitals in the era of Labor’s Future Made in Australia program. If you’re seeking a fistful of dollars or a tax break, merely sprinkling the term “productivity” isn’t going to cut it these days. “Clean energy” and “resilience” may perk up a weary official on a bad hair day.

Glencore claimed the outback smelter was losing a ton of money. Picture: Glencore

But the real coin among the federal capital’s executive class is generated by making the case for “national security”, “a strategic national asset”, “self-reliance” and “critical minerals”. That last term will be working overtime for Team Australia during the Prime Minister’s mercy dash to meet Donald Trump at the White House on October 20.

In August, Nyrstar secured a [$135m rescue deal](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/critical-minerals-transformation-across-two-key-smelters-a-boost-for-sovereign-capacity/news-story/7d98f52ff4bed2d833efb49d345bf31f) for its Hobart zinc and Port Pirie lead smelters, with the lion’s share of funding from the federal and South Australian governments, and one-sixth from Tasmania. The package was presented as a critical minerals bonanza, to produce antimony and bismuth (in SA) and germanium and indium in Tasmania.

According to Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres, these minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology.

In February, Albanese had pledged $2.4bn to prop up the Whyalla steelworks. It was a day after SA Premier Peter Malinauskas seized control of [Sanjeev Gupta’s operations](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/peter-malinauskass-bermuda-triangle-of-funding-to-blow-huge-hole-in-budget/news-story/5c81a0b99e6aa4b5865503a8b430674a) on the Eyre Peninsula and placed it in administration.

As well, the Rio Tinto-owned Tomago aluminium smelter in the NSW Hunter region, the [nation’s largest energy user](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/agl-energy-delivers-grim-reality-check-on-tomago-aluminium-smelter/news-story/cf2caace781ac2510b029f4d6a25f5d9), also has been in talks with state and federal officials, reportedly seeking billions in assistance. As Dolly might put, “here you come again”.

Glencore, listed on the London stock exchange, is the world’s largest coal producer; it employs 150,000 workers but is going through a $US1bn ($1.5bn) cost-cutting drive. The company’s share price is down 15 per cent over the past year, but the outlook for copper has improved despite various production snarls.

While negotiating with the two governments during the past eight months, Glencore claimed the outback smelter was losing a ton of money. Glencore has projected [$2.2bn in operational losses](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/speculation-600m-deal-over-three-years-needed-to-save-glencore-copper-smelter/news-story/ac91c2a2bfb602186b59210f099fcf4d) across the seven years to 2031 because of a drop in the charges other companies pay to have their products processed. As well, there’s a global glut of smelting capacity, largely in China and India, and a shortage of copper concentrates.

“The competition in the global smelting market is fierce and it’s not a level playing field with countries trying to take strategic positions in the market,” said Troy Wilson, the interim chief operating officer of Glencore’s local metals business. “It is our hope that conditions improve over the next three years to a point where government assistance is no longer necessary.”

Naturally, as is the way of these handouts under Labor’s industrial adventure, and sub-par transition to cleaner energy, Ayres glammed it up as an “investment” in industrial capacity and to “protect” 600 jobs. “Copper is critical to building solar panels, wind turbines and energy storage systems,” Ayres said.

“This investment strengthens our supply chains and supports Australia’s transition to net zero. If Australia didn’t already have established facilities like the Mount Isa copper smelter, we’d be looking to build them to protect Australia’s industrial capability, and strengthen the capability needed for (the) future.”

We’re in a bleak era of [rampant protectionism](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/us-presidents-troubles-come-cheap-but-will-leave-expensive/news-story/f6ea836799e8cf686506f2acb5419692), where self-harm is the ardour of the day. It did not start on January 20 this year but, as in so many spheres of activity, Trump Unbound has been a force multiplier. Just days before the US President was sworn in, the International Monetary Fund warned tariffs and subsidies “rarely improve domestic prospects durably” and might leave “every country worse off”.

Last year Productivity Commission chairwoman [Danielle Wood warned](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/future-made-in-australia-productivity-commissions-danielle-wood-reveals-hidden-cost-of-anthony-albaneses-future/news-story/690e34b972e07355d92728ad7e569112) that unless government assistance had a well-defined exit strategy, Labor’s signature industry policy risked building a class of businesses dependent on forever subsidies.

“For industries that are not able to stand on their own two feet in competing globally, more money will be needed for every year we choose to ‘rent’ the industry,” Wood told Inquirer in April last year. “We will see a whole class of businesses whose livelihoods depend on ongoing support, which will have an incentive to spend a lot of time and ­resources ensuring that the tap is not turned off.

“To make sure that new supports make sense, we would encourage the government to be very clear in specifying their policy objectives. Understanding whether we are trying to reduce supply-chain risks, speed up the green transition or create jobs is needed to help evaluate whether the policies stack up.”

Minerals are critical inputs for defence, clean energy, transport, advanced manufacturing and technology. Picture: Glencore

To ensure Labor’s industry policy had effective guardrails, Treasury developed a [National Interest Framework](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/labor-future-made-in-australia-tense-amid-bill-impasse/news-story/443198f54611b83032a0eb0185e62f2c), a set of hoops projects needed to go through before qualifying for public funding. There are two streams, one supporting net zero, the other economic resilience and security. Is there any evidence these guardrails are anything more than the flimsy high-vis plastic barriers councils erect around local works?

Given Australia’s new world of trade and strategic threats, and inevitable policy tensions between financial prosperity and national security, former Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy has spoken about adapting Australia’s successful model of economic and social progress.

“But it also needs to maintain the conventional economic considerations of budget constraints, trade-offs and cost-benefit analysis,” Kennedy, now secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said in May. As former economic adviser to Barack Obama Jason Furman has argued, those wise conventions went missing in action under Joe Biden’s wayward administration in a “post-neoliberal delusion”.

A year earlier in an [address to the US Studies Centre](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/treasury-secretary-steven-kennedy-backs-strong-guardrails-for-made-in-australia-plan/news-story/6d667310b89ba4ade82850f100332ca2?btr=2f0e5e70b3860afd2a4ffb446a60e2fd), echoing the PC’s Wood (and a chorus line of her predecessors), Kennedy noted there was a “heightened risk” that inefficient industries would be propped up by taxpayers if government interventions aimed at building economic resilience were poorly targeted. In the event of another global disruption, Kennedy advised, we needed to build up other trusted sources of supply.

Explaining Labor’s push to establish protections around key parts of the economy, Kennedy referenced the “small yard, high fence” strategy. He noted the “immense pressure that policymakers are under to expand the ‘yard’.” Well, here we go again, and Albo is flashing the national credit card.

There’s little doubt high energy costs and workplace re-regulation are putting the squeeze on metals producers. BlueScope chief executive Mark Vassella is leading a group that is negotiating with the federal government to control the Whyalla steelworks.

He told the National Press Club on Wednesday that because markets had been distorted by countries such as China, “you run the risk of industry appearing to be uneconomic”. Simply arguing the technocrats’ naive view of “let the market decide”, Vassella claimed, was “a slippery slope that I wouldn’t want to see us on”.

Yet bailout after bailout, we’re stumbling headlong into a money pit; amid a slag heap of woe, surrounded by a battered old fence, our baleful yard is gathering noxious weeds and rusty junk.

Australia’s latest $600m industrial rescue package dwarfs previous bailouts and is creating a class of mendicants that can’t stand on their own feet.

Main question is to discuss but also tell me what I offer should pick?

Hello, So Ive been lucky to get multiple job offers I can take as a recent university graduate, I did a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. So the offers I received for the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms everyone knows and puts on a pedestal as well as the mining engineering Fly in fly out offer.

Second path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical/mining engineering roles offered.

I’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pay for mechanical/traditional engineers at the same top company FAANG was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path.

Thanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role

But I’m just really curious to why this is the case even matching at a top company so it’s a bit more even the software/tech engineers get paid more than the traditional/mechanical engineers like even from levels fyi and from my own experiences and offers and friends/acquaintances have told.
Even my dad is a team lead in mining engineering as a mining engineer yet my Software Engineering offer at FAANG pays more than that which is crazy.

TLDR, FAANG software engineering offer laid 130k more than my highest traditional engineering offers which included mechanical and mining engineering job offers at top firms for traditional engineers such as Boeing, Defence and Rio Tinto. Also FAANG offered me interview and salary for Software Engineer and Mechanical Engineer role but the Software Engineering role still paid significantly higher so I just went with that.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.676567,2025-07-01T20:30:33,Rio Tinto,2025
580,1nk40mf,How to Get a Job as a Geologist in Australia,PanzerBiscuit,/r/geologycareers/comments/1nk40mf/how_to_get_a_job_as_a_geologist_in_australia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/1nk40mf/how_to_get_a_job_as_a_geologist_in_australia/,55,6,1758189167.0,"Hey legends! 

I’m an Australian geologist currently working in the exploration sector, and I often see questions from international geos about how to break into the geology scene.

 So I thought I’d share a simple step-by-step guide based on what I’ve seen works for others, especially around job hunting and visa options. It's not an exhaustive summary, but it should help people find answers to some of the basic questions which get asked on here a lot. 

Whether you're into mineral exploration, environmental geology, or mining, Australia has a thriving geoscience industry. Here's how to get your foot in the door, without buying some bullshit FIFO guide from some Irish mug on TikTok.

# Step 1: Understand the Job Landscape

Geology jobs in Australia are concentrated in every state, here is a general breakdown:

* **Western Australia** – gold, iron ore, lithium, nickel. Everything. Literally God's country
* **Queensland** – coal, copper, gold. Not bad, but not WA
* **South Australia** – uranium, copper, gold, other shit
* **Victoria &amp; NSW** – environmental and engineering geology. Gold and Copper. Dogshit state
* **Northern Territory** \- gold, uranium, copper. Not a bad place to work

Best places to find jobs:

* [Seek.com.au](http://Seek.com.au)
* LinkedIn
* Company career pages (BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Evolution Mining etc)
* Your network

# Step 2: Qualifications &amp; Skills

Most roles require:

* A Bachelor’s degree in Geology
   * Honours, Masters and PhD's aren't required. 
* Field experience (internships or prior roles)
   * Experience counts for a lot
* Software skills (ArcGIS, Leapfrog, Micromine, Qgis etc.)
   * Nice to have
* Good attitude. Be a good cunt
   * Imperative

If you studied overseas, you may need a skills assessment through VETASSESS or Engineers Australia to validate your qualifications. Unfortunately not all universities are the same. If you graduated from a first world institution, you should be fine. If you graduated from the University of Improvised Solutions and Creative Excuses (UISCE) your degree probably wont be recognized.

# Step 3: Visa Pathways for International Geologists

Australia offers several visa options for geologists. I am not a Visa agent, so it is worthwhile paying the money to speak to someone to get some accurate advice. 

#  Skilled Migration (Points-Based)

* Subclass 189 (Skilled Independent) or Subclass 190 (State Sponsored)
* Geologist is on the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List (MLTSSL), which is good.
* You’ll need:
   * Skills assessment
   * English test (IELTS or PTE)
   * Expression of Interest (EOI) via SkillSelect
   * Enough points (based on age, experience, education, etc.)

#  Employer Sponsored Visas

* Subclass 482 (Temporary Skill Shortage) or Subclass 186 (Employer Nomination Scheme)
* Requires a job offer from an approved sponsor, common in mining and exploration companies

#  Working Holiday Visa (Subclass 417 or 462)

* If you're aged 18–30 (or 35 for some countries), this is a great way to enter Australia and work casually or short-term
* Many geology grads use this to get field assistant roles or short contracts, then transition to skilled visas later
* You can stay up to 12 months (extendable), and it’s a great way to build local experience

If you're hoping to get sponsored whilst you are in the UK, Canada or the USA. Goodluck. You have a 0.001% chance of that happening, unless you are a fucking geology gun. As a grad, get a WHV and come here that way. 

# Step 4: Apply &amp; Network

Tailor your resume to Aussie standards and highlight:

* Fieldwork experience
* Safety certifications (e.g., First Aid, operate and maintain a 4x4 vehicle)
* Willingness to work in remote areas or FIFO (Fly-In Fly-Out)

Join professional bodies like:

* AusIMM (Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy)
* Geological Society of Australia
* Australian Institute of Geoscientists(AIG)

Attend webinars, conferences, and local meetups. Networking goes a long way here. See my point about being a good cunt again for further reference. 

# Final Tips

* Be open to contract roles, they often lead to permanent gigs
* Get your documents sorted early (passport, transcripts, references)
   * Make it easy to get hired. If you make it difficult your application will go in the bin
* Consider short courses in Australian geology or mining safety
* Get a tax file number, super account, bank account organized as soon as you land in Australia. That way you are all set up to get on boarded, and paid. 
* Use Telstra for your phone. Avoid Vodaphone and Optus. You wont have reception onsite, or in remote areas. 
* The housing situation here is a bit fucked at the moment. Expect to struggle to find accommodation, or pay a lot. Try and find a share house or hostel before you arrive.  ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677176,2025-09-18T19:52:47,Rio Tinto,2025
581,1o27t0d,🚨 Gunnison Copper (GCUMF) — America’s Next Copper Boom? 🚨,Sarn3k,/r/pennystocks/comments/1o27t0d/gunnison_copper_gcumf_americas_next_copper_boom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1o27t0d/gunnison_copper_gcumf_americas_next_copper_boom/,3,7,1760021017.0,"Gunnison Copper is a severely undervalued pure-play copper developer with production starting in 2025, backed by Rio Tinto, and aligned with U.S. national strategy to secure domestic copper supply. This could be a multi-bagger for early investors.

🔎 Why I’m Buying Gunnison Copper (GCUMF)

- Production starts Q3 2025 at Johnson Camp Mine (JCM), with up to 25M lbs/year of copper cathode. No waiting 5–10 years like other juniors.
- NPV of $1.3B and IRR of 20.9% from the Gunnison Project. Payback in 4.1 years. That’s insane for a sub-$50M market cap.
- Backed by Nuton LLC (Rio Tinto) — they’re funding and providing tech for Stage 2 development. This isn’t a solo junior struggling for cash.
- $13.9M in transferable 48C tax credits from the U.S. government. Gunnison is the only copper project to receive this.
- University of Arizona study projects $14.6B in total output and 53,000 job-years created. This is a generational asset.
- SX/EW technology means they produce finished copper cathode on-site — no smelter dependency, no overseas shipping.
- Arizona location = low geopolitical risk, direct rail access, and full alignment with U.S. push for domestic resource independence.

🧠 Macro Tailwinds

- Copper is a critical mineral for EVs, renewables, and defense. U.S. wants to stop relying on imports.
- Global copper supply is tightening. Prices are expected to surge as demand outpaces new production.
- Gunnison is one of the few projects that can deliver Made-in-America copper in the next 12–18 months.

🧨 My Take

This is one of the few penny stocks with real assets, real production, and real backing. It’s not a biotech hope or a meme pump. It’s copper, it’s domestic, and it’s happening soon.

Bit of context I’ve been working FIFO for the past 8 years (im Australian). I’ve been drilling for ausdrill, Rio Tinto, MRL, FMG. I’ve been lucky enough to work on a few different sites and meet some amazing people. 
1. The amount of backpackers working in the mines on a working holiday visa is actually insane. True most of them work on shutdowns and won’t get a full time job with any of the big boys. BUT doesn’t mean they won’t get jobs in mining. You really want a job? Go move to Kalgoorlie and you WILL get a job. Hell I moved to Kalgoorlie to get my first mining job. Though most of you definitely wouldn’t last a week offsiding. 
2. As for TikTok videos. I mean tbh some of them are pretty accurate 😂 All of you that call bullshit have either never worked in the mines or are doing mining completely wrong 😅😂 
IF only you knew what blast hole drillers do in a day 😂😂😂😂.
3. As for pay, no you won’t be earning 200k+ a year as an entry level. Heck I’m only just cracking that as an experienced driller. Realistically you would be making 110k-120k a year as an entry level offsider. 
4. Lastly all I want to say is, don’t let some dumbass that couldn’t get into the mines tell you, you can’t. I’ve had offsiders from holland and France get sponsored and become drillers. The amount of backpackers working for shut down crews and catering companies are insane. 
Be realistic, you won’t get jobs working for the big companies. Non the less allot of the labour higher agency’s will higher you. Get all ur tickets, grow some balls and move to a mining town. If you can’t get a job, something is wrong with you. ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677227,2024-07-07T10:43:30,Rio Tinto,2024

One knock off effect of this is that the big three Iron producers in Australia, FMG BHP RIO, have had considerable decreases in share price. 

BHP has fallen 32.90% from its high this year for a $66b USD decrease in value

RIO has fallen 29.62% from its high this year for a $47b USD decrease in value 

FMG has fallen 44.06% from its high this year for a $26b USD decrease in value

Collectively, the big three of this industry have **lost ~$140b USD in value** from the peak this year. 

Now could this massive burst really all stem from the greatest housing bubble in the history of the world? At a first glance, it may appear plausible, but I would like to offer a different explanation. 

In early May 2020, RIO was sitting at a measly $45.01 per share at a market cap of $67b USD. The leadership realized something needed to be done. By the end of May, the news broke that [RIO destroyed a system of 46,000-year-old Aboriginal caves in Western Australia dating back to the last Ice Age.](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/mining-firm-rio-tinto-sorry-for-destroying-aboriginal-caves/). When asked for an explanation, CEO Chris Salisbury exclaimed that he was [""sorry for the distress we have caused""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4), and that  ""We **pay our respects** to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura People (PKKP).""

The result?  Within a year RIO shares skyrocket more than 100% to the $95.97 high, adding roughly $90b value to shareholders.  Now when you consider that only $135m in iron ore was expected to be extracted following this operation, we can assign the majority of the added value to the Sigma chad energy gained by destroying one of the oldest cultural heritage sites on the planet. You might beg to differ, claiming something stupid about changing iron ore prices, but I think the results are obvious. You're probably just one of the 60% of beta cuck shareholders that voted down executive bonus pay for the company following such an outstandingly successful mission. The free market has decided that the destruction of cultural heritage sites is a vital factor in determining value for a mining company. RIO needs to get their groove back.

I spent some time researching various sites that RIO had feasible access to, but then a bolt of inspiration hit me. In the grand scheme of cultural significance, these caves really were a small player. There is no reason for the company to restrain itself to minor targets when a grand statement could set their legacy forever. There are many Australian super funds hanging in the balance here. We need a destructive event to shake the world.

[From the Australian Government Tourist Industry database](https://www.tra.gov.au/Regional/local-government-area-profiles), approximately 1.9 million people visited the Northern Territory in the pre-covid year period 2018/19.  These tourists spent nearly $2.5b. Of these tourists, ~250,000 went to Alice Springs to visit our great cultural wonder, Uluru. Therefore if we decide Uluru is a company, it has a yearly revenue of 2.5\*(0.25/1.9) = $330m. Taking the P/R of one of our most respected, effectively valued companies, Afterpay, ($37.5b MC at $836m revenue =&gt; 88 P/R ratio), this values Uluru at 0.33\*88 = $29 Billion.

Now we need to factor in the Effective Cultural Value Leverage (ECVL) to get a true valuation as to what destroying Uluru would gain for RIO. If destroying a series of caves for $135m in iron ore created $90b in value, this means the average ECVL (n=1) is 90/0.135 =  666 (3 s.f). With our holy number, the ECVL valuation of destroying Uluru is 29\***666** = 19.3 Trillion Dollars. This would make RIO nearly 10x larger than the greatest American companies, and put the ASX on the map as one of the largest markets in the world. It is time to ""pay our respects"".

Now that we have a calculated plan to rescue the Australian economy, we need an appropriate method of execution. Obliterating Uluru out of existence will not be a simple task. [According to a 2018 Geological survey](https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/discover/highlights/amazing-facts/), Uluru is an estimated 1.425 billion tons of solid rock above the ground. To be sure and completely destroy the foundations of a global icon, we should be prepared to move 5 billion tons. The regular TNT demolitions will not work for a job this big. We're gonna need a bigger bomb 
☢️☢️☢️.

[The Sedan crater is a 390mx100m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_Crater) hole in the Nevada desert created by a 104KT thermonuclear explosion. In this explosion, an estimated 11 million tons of earth was shifted. Again by analogy, the most accurate of scientific methods, we could expect to destroy ~1 million tons of rock for every 1 KT of TNT in our explosion. Therefore, we need an atomic device capable of delivering a payload of 50,000 KT.

Luckily for us, such a device has been created and successfully tested. Designed by the glorious Soviet Union in 1961,  the [Tsar Bomba (""Mother of all Bombs"")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba) is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a Hydrogen bomb with a measured yield of 50,000 KT. A perfect match for our requirements.

To conclude, the Science has made the correct course of action obvious. Destroying aboriginal cultural heritage sites is what RIO does best, and should be remembered for all time. The above described course of action should be embraced to create stakeholder wealth. There are obvious Environmental, Social, and Governance benefits in this decision. Therefore, it is with utmost haste that I shall urge the executive leadership of the second largest Iron producer in Australia to commission the Russian Government to once again create the greatest weapon of mass destruction the world has ever seen. The economy needs a sacrifice.

Edit: Thanks for the mod who gave this the correct flair, had it incorrectly flaired as Dumbfuck Discussion before.

Edit2: Added USD for currencies for clarity, had BHP RIO values in USD but FMG in AUD, fucking google finance. Fixed it now. The $135m value for the cave project is in AUD, and should be converted to USD, but this simply means that the ECVL should be higher than what I have calculated. Leaving as is because 666 is a good meme, and we should always strive to be conservative with estimates.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677241,2021-09-28T18:42:21,RIO,2021

**Deal would buy 10% of firm with Nevada lithium venture**

[US seeks equity stake in Canada mining company | The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette - Arkansas' Best News Source](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/sep/28/us-seeks-equity-stake-in-canada-mining-company/)

WASHINGTON -- The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

**The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China**.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" in a speech this week at the United Nations. ""If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cellphones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

# SEPT. 26th, 2025~ Niron breaks ground on rare earth-free magnet manufacturing plant in Minnesota

[Niron breaks ground on rare earth-free magnet manufacturing plant in Minnesota - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/niron-breaks-ground-on-rare-earth-free-magnet-manufacturing-plant-in-minnesota/)

[Rendering from Niron Magnetics.](https://preview.redd.it/jaxnxyuo5wrf1.png?width=1319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fce4682d56752a854ed17974206d4a5413a83510)

Niron Magnetics broke ground Friday on a new 1,500-ton-per-year permanent magnet manufacturing facility in Sartell, Minnesota.

After nearly a decade of research and development in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the University of Minnesota, Niron Magnetics said it has successfully created one of the first commercially viable new magnet materials in decades, capable of producing superior permanent magnets.

Niron Magnetics said its product does not contain any rare-earth elements, and is made from abundant elements such as iron and nitrogen.

The company said it is able to scale manufacturing of permanent magnets made from iron nitride, which exhibits exceptionally high magnetization and removes the need for rare-earth elements.

Investors and commercial partners include Stellantis, Samsung, Allison Transmission, Magna, and others already sampling products from the pilot facility, it said.

The new 190,000-square-foot facility will expand Niron Magnetics’ capacity to supply rare-earth-free permanent magnets for data center cooling pumps, automobile motors, robotics, consumer electronics, defense and drone equipment, and other applications critical to the U.S. Economy, it said.

The facility will be built on the former Verso Paper Mill site, redeveloping a US designated coal community property.

The development comes at a critical time, as pressure on rare-earth supply chains intensifies due to geopolitical tensions and rising demand for permanent magnets globally.

“We’re proud to scale this homegrown technology in the heart of the industrial Midwest, and excited to make this community central to America’s supply chain independence,” Niron CEO Jonathan Rowntree said in a news release.

The plant will be operational in early 2027 and will create over 175 full-time jobs in  
manufacturing, engineering, and operations, the company said.

“Permanent magnets are an essential part of modern vehicles, the heart of the performance for everything from powertrains and cooling systems to seat motors and speakers. We are committed to offering the freedom of choice to our customers and the integration of these magnets is critical to that mission,” Stellantis VP, Propulsion Systems Engineering, Sinisa Jurkovic said.

“We’ve been working with Niron since 2023to unlock next-generation motor performance, and Iron Nitride technology is helping us engineer and deliver vehicles with best-in-class capabilities.”

# Opinion of Titanium’s historic adoption curve vs. Scandium &amp; ScAl alloy projected trajectory.

https://preview.redd.it/y9ek0dc87wrf1.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28aac04dcba8be1b71a957347324070061403b2

# 🔑 Core Similarities

* **Both metals too expensive and scarce without government backing!**
* Both needed **DoD adoption first** (SR-71 then → Gen VI now).
* Both required **price support + stockpiling** to establish floor pricing.
* Both needed **pilot → demo → full-scale production** facilities (Titanium sponge plants then → Sc-Al billet/plate facilities now).
* **Both transformed into strategic materials underpinning aerospace and defense supply chains.**

# 🎯 Why This Matters for NioCorp

* Titanium’s U.S. adoption **couldn’t have happened without federal intervention** — same might be true for scandium.
* NioCorp provides the Premiere upstream feedstock; For billet &amp; Plate capacities alongside allied &amp; other domestic sources allowing (Diversity of Supply).
* Once the government **establishes the floor &amp; funds facilities**, Scandium can follow Titanium’s curve: defense → aerospace → mainstream industry.

**IMHO- The U.S. Scandium story is unfolding almost exactly the way titanium did in the 1950s**. Titanium only moved from “exotic metal” to cornerstone aerospace material because the U.S. government stepped in with price supports, military demand guarantees, and direct funding for production facilities. That intervention created the base load of demand that allowed companies like Boeing and the broader commercial sector to adopt titanium decades later. The Pentagon essentially built the titanium industry from scratch — and today, we might be watching the same blueprint emerge for scandium.

**NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is the keystone.** With scandium oxide pricing now anchored by the Pentagon’s $40M Rio Tinto contract, and with federal lenders like EXIM and DFC lining up, the U.S. is signaling that scandium alloys are too strategic to leave to chance. NioCorp cannot carry this alone — but just as titanium required major government intervention, scandium requires the same. That’s why we’re now seeing capital raises, defense-prime partnership rumors, and active discussions about government stakes in key Critical minerals projects.

**Mark Smith’s vision of making the U.S. the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” is not just a soundbite — it’s been the playbook!** Elk Creek can provide the raw material, but government-backed funding for billet, plate, and alloy facilities will be what unlocks true adoption. The dots are connecting: federal price floors (See Rio Tinto $40M contract.), mine financing (In play EXIM &amp; others), manufacturing hubs (T.B.D.), and defense procurement (Working with DoD Defense Primes per Mark Smith Sept. 8th, 2025) are converging. Exactly as Titanium before it.

**Scandium is poised to leap from lab curiosity to national industrial asset — with NioCorp at the center.**

**\~Monday’s tape won’t just be about the $60M closing — it’s about the market digesting the why:**

**Scandium —** DLA floor price ($6,250/kg) + November alloy reveal = government-backed runway.

**Niobium —** 100% import reliance, hypersonics/naval steel ? **Elk Creek as the only U.S. option!!!**.

**Titanium &amp; TiCl4 —** Imperative for jets, armor, and next-gen systems, and **Niocorp uniquely able to produce.**

**REEs —** The “bonus lever” for vertical integration and long-term defense tech demand.

**Plus...**

# ~The October drill results with the potential to re-rate the entire deposit!!!~

**This doesn’t have the luxury of later — if not now, when? They’re moving with lithium (Thacker Pass), with MP Materials, and the logical next node imho is Elk Creek — a multi-metal, U.S.-based complex that answers four critical supply gaps at once.**

**NioCorp's Q4 is loaded!!** Munich conference visibility, **October drill results with potential to re-rate the entire deposit**, scandium and alloy announcements, off-take agreements across multiple products, and the updated DFS. Add in an EXIM/DFC final investment decision, Great Britain collaboration, and a 2029 production horizon, and Elk Creek stands at the intersection of government strategy and market demand. **This isn’t just a mine — it’s a U.S. resource independence play, with catalysts stacked and ignition sequence armed.**

# NioCorp —is shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. 🚀

Jim Chalmers has been urged to develop a strategy before propping up under-pressure manufacturers as the Tomago smelter seeks billions of dollars in support.

By Ronald Mizen

5 min. readView original

Two former Productivity Commission bosses say there is a significant risk federal and state governments are held to ransom by uneconomic energy-intensive manufacturers who goad them into expensive taxpayer bailouts.

Peter Harris and Michael Brennan have urged Treasurer Jim Chalmers to use his economic reform agenda to develop a clear strategy for deciding if taxpayer support for under-pressure businesses is the right move over the long term to avoid throwing good money after bad.

It comes after *The Australian Financial Review* last month revealed that the Tomago aluminium smelter was in [urgent talks to secure billions of dollars](https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/rio-pushes-for-eye-watering-tomago-bailout-20250606-p5m5ih) in support from the NSW and federal governments to save it from failing due to [crippling energy costs.](https://www.afr.com/politics/minns-confirms-talks-to-save-tomago-aluminium-smelter-20250612-p5m6zf)

Meanwhile, the chief executive of Nyrstar this week said the metal processor needed to secure a taxpayer rescue package to ensure the future for its loss-making zinc smelters in South Australia and Tasmania as the company’s [Swiss owner Trafigura weighs whether to close the plants.](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz)

Matt Howell, who took over as head of Nyrstar Australia in January, argued the matter was “urgent” and [could not be put off to the next federal budget.](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/nyrstar-warns-of-urgent-serious-risk-of-smelter-closure-20250626-p5mahs) He cited Labor’s commitment to maintain domestic manufacturing under its signature Future Made in Australia policy as justification for taxpayer funds.

The crisis underlines the financial struggles faced by manufacturers of aluminium, nickel, copper and other metals amid significant declines in treatment and refining revenues, as well as rising energy costs.

Brennan, who led the Productivity Commission from 2018 to 2023 and now heads think tank the e61 Institute, said it was sometimes difficult amid the chaos of a threatened closure and loss of jobs to discern whether something was a good deal and good value for money.

“There’s always a significant risk governments get held ransom and you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies,” he said.

Harris, who chaired the commission between 2013 and 2018, said there was a danger of adding “band-aid upon a band-aid”.

“We’re clearly in danger of not recalling the lessons we’ve learned because we think this is new and mega because Trump’s made it a bigger thing,” he said of the focus on propping up domestic manufacturing under the banner of “resilience”.

# Reform agenda

Resilience, boosting productivity and making the federal budget more sustainable are the three themes of Chalmers’ economic roundtable in Canberra next month, which the treasurer hopes will spark a major reform agenda.

Peter Harris: “We should be working out what is sustainable here.” Australian Financial Review

Both Harris and Brennan said there were circumstances where it might be appropriate to support a business, such as helping it get through a period of unsustainable energy prices or investing in productivity-improving plant.

But there needed to be a clear framework that meant requests were not being dealt with on an ad-hoc basis and provided benefits to taxpayers, rather than just doling out operational cash.

“Things like sovereign capability and resilience can be difficult things to pin down. That’s not to say they’re not important, but what matters is you have a systematic framework by which you think through these things so you’re not hostage to sort of piecemeal, case-by-case crisis decisions,” Brennan said. “What does the taxpayer get in return?”

Harris indicated that politicians often make decisions to solve an immediate political problem without considering more fundamental issues.

“The biggest problem with these things is there needs to be some kind of assessment asking: is it genuinely sustainable if we do what they’re asking us to do, or is it sub-scale and unlikely to be sustainable?” he said.

“Now is the time to turn the Industry Department’s heads away from ‘when opportunity knocks, let’s get some dough,’ to doing the analysis. We should be working out what is sustainable here.”

That meant assessing domestic and international markets to decide whether manufacturers would be viable again or keep needing bailouts. He said it may be appropriate to continue propping up companies supplying the local market for sovereign capability reasons.

# ‘Truly insane’

“You can make the domestic argument, but you certainly can’t make the export argument ... The idea of paying to export something is truly, truly insane. You’ve determined to subsidise foreigners,” Harris said.

Howell said Nyrstar needed assistance to weather “several hundred million” in losses expected over the next two years while the company considers whether it can upgrade the plants to process the critical minerals.

Hundreds of millions of dollars are also required for the rebuild of the Port Pirie smelter in SA, while a $400 million upgrade is needed at the Nyrstar smelter near Hobart. That plant had already secured $70 million of funding from the federal and Tasmanian governments, but work on that project was put on hold by the company late last year due to rising costs.

The $50 million from the federal government was promised by both Labor and the Coalition during the 2022 election campaign.[ The *Financial Review*  has previously revealed](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz) the responsible department has no record of being asked for the money by the recipient or anyone.

The funds were also promised without a business case, analysis of the value proposition of the project, and no probity advice.

While [Nyrstar has struggled to make a decent return](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/trafigura-wipes-266m-off-its-australian-smelters-20221209-p5c53d), Trafigura in 2022 and 2023 booked profits worth more than $US14 billion ($20 billion), with each year setting a fresh record.

The Tomago aluminium smelter is the nation’s largest electricity user and discussions about its bailout package are focused on the smelter’s electricity contract for 2026 to 2029 and the design of federal Labor’s production tax credits.

“They’re running around in Sydney and Canberra looking for a lot of money,” a source previously told the *Financial Review*. “It’s billions, not hundreds of millions. It’s eye-watering.”

Tomago is 51.6 per cent owned by mining giant Rio Tinto and uses about 10 per cent of NSW’s power supply running around the clock. It employs about 1000 people directly and claims to create as many as 5000 indirect jobs.

The facility, which is also part-owned by CSR and Hydro Aluminium, is the country’s biggest aluminium producer, generating about 590,000 tonnes a year or around 37 per cent of Australia’s primary aluminium.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677360,2025-07-04T06:49:29,Rio Tinto,2025

I invested in Fannie Mae, PLTR, HOOD, OKLO, and CCJ. I started with 940k in August of 2024. Completely life changing.
During this time I’ve lost my job in the film industry. Phased out by a number of forces, strikes, fires, and AI.
I’m wondering how much I can make in Dividends. I’ve watch Rio Tinto for a long time. 
It’s just that the 6-8% game is always a loser to me. 
I make much much much more than that.
I understand dividend are “safer” but I’m not so sure. 
Inflation and taxes eat up a bunch. 
I don’t have so much hubris to think I can keep doing what I have been doing. I’ve been aiming for 5 million but losing any of this money would not be worth it. 
Also I imagine that people move to dividend stocks when market crashes so they rise? Is that true? I. That case I would have capital to buy real estate or depreciated stocks when the crash hits and would be getting paid to wait for it (I like this idea right around now. Based on the crippling amount of dept we are due for a major debt crisis. Not just federal, but corporate and especially municipal (those municipal bond holders that go on and on about not paying taxes they’re gonna get burnt.)
If anyone has ideas opinions about my situation I would be grateful.

Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on similR subreddits to this. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear)

I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. 

No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. 

There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. 

Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours)

Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. 
There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere.

Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc.

Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. 

Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. 

Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD
PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. 

Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. 

There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. 

The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

For all my usual analysis please rank posts in the subreddit by NEW and go through them. have covered a lot this morning, as usual. 

MACRO:

* China cuts 7 day reverse repo rate by 20bps, biggest stimulus move since Pandemic. The cut is intended to ""further strengthen counter-cyclical adjustment of monetary policy and support stable growth,"" according to the PBOC. 

**JAPANESE NEWS tHATS DRIVING thE YEN HIGHER AND NIKKEI LOWER:**

* **Shigeru Ishiba (former Japanese Defense Minister) wins LDP leadership election to become next PM.**
* This move in JPY is a reflection of both Ishiba’s win (who is supportive of BOJ policy normalization &amp; rate hikes), AND the pricing OUT of pre-election front-runner Takaichi, who was the only candidate with a pro-Abenomics continuation (buy JGBs endlessly) / rate hike opposer
* SO someone who was OPPOSED TO RATE HIKES is being replaced with someone who is FOR rate hikes. That in itself is a hawkish signal, hence JPY is shooting up as a result to reflect that increased chance of more rate hikes.
* In addition to the JPY↑ move, Ishiba is a big China hawk, and NKY just erased its China-driven equity market gains from/for the week

[The GM logo is seen on the China Headquarters in Shanghai, China, August 29, 2022. REUTERS\/Aly Song© Thomson Reuters](https://preview.redd.it/dnadwj9b3hsf1.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f88266ba9a781010dce78607bc5dd0d26c040069)

(Reuters) -Vancouver-based Lithium Americas said on Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has taken a 5% stake in the company, along with a separate 5% stake in its Thacker Pass lithium project joint venture with General Motors.

U.S.-listed shares of Lithium Americas jumped 31% to $7.48 in premarket tradingst, 2025\~World Takes First Steps in Breaking China’s Stranglehold on Rare Earth Magnets Supply

While the total deal value was not disclosed, Lithium Americas confirmed it has finalized an agreement with the DOE to initiate the first $435 million draw from a previously announced $2.26 billion loan to support development of the Thacker Pass site.

It will be the latest private sector investment by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration after recent stakes in Intel and MP Materials, seeking to boost industries seen as vital to U.S. national security.

Last week, Reuters reported that administration officials were in discussions with Lithium Americas about an equity stake as they renegotiated terms of a $2.26 billion government loan for the Nevada-based mine, which is slated to become the largest source of battery metal lithium in the Western Hemisphere.

Representatives for GM were not immediately available to comment.

GM, which invested $625 million in the mine last year for a 38% stake, has the right to buy all of the project's lithium from its first phase and a portion from the second phase for 20 years.

Administration officials had initially sought a guarantee that GM would buy the metal regardless of market conditions, a request the automaker pushed back on and which led to the equity stake request, Reuters previously reported.

The Thacker Pass project has long been touted by both Republicans and Democrats as a key way to boost U.S. critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world's largest lithium processor.

China plays a dominant role in the global lithium supply chain, producing more than 40,000 metric tons each year, making it the third-largest producer after Australia and Chile. China's influence is far greater in refining, where it processes over 75% of the world's lithium into battery-grade material.

The U.S. produces less than 5,000 metric tons of lithium at a Nevada facility owned by Albemarle. Thacker Pass's first phase is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year, enough for up to 800,000 EVs.

# Oct. 1st, 2025~World Takes First Steps in Breaking China’s Stranglehold on Rare Earth Magnets Supply

[Rare Earth Magnets: World Takes Steps to Break China's Hold](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/10/01/first-steps-china-rare-earth-magnets/)

https://preview.redd.it/am15da1d2hsf1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c62fa44836b4bbce3230e056e1a347d7e929b46

Resource security when it comes to rare earth magnets is something the modern-day world has been desperately trying to get right. This is primarily due to rare earths’ increasing importance in electronics, defense, vehicles, and much more. 

For years, countries have been seeking ways to secure access to these vital resources. However, 90% of the current supply is in the hands of China, whose relationship with the U.S. and other countries has not been ideal of late. Despite best efforts, many nations remain dependent on Beijing for their [rare earth needs.](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/09/09/rare-earths-mmi-end-of-summer-rally/) Now, that could be starting to change.

# Rare Earth Magnets More Critical Than Ever

These days, almost every progressive nation covets rare earth magnets due to their ability to deliver exceptionally strong magnetic force in compact sizes, enabling the construction of high-efficiency motors and miniaturized components. This is what allows them to power essential systems in electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, medical devices, and defense equipment.

[Credit: Peter Hansen](https://preview.redd.it/4rteoz7g2hsf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f7d0d917c8e01c6d98dbf5e0ccf4f6e00bdee12)

The magnets possess unique properties, such as heat resistance, which makes them even more critical in applications where performance and precision are crucial. So, as global industries shift toward electrification and automation, rare earth magnets have become strategic assets, with supply chain control increasingly viewed as a matter of national security.

MetalMiner customers have saved millions of dollars by following MetalMiner’s industrial buying strategies. [Take a look at MetalMiner’s track record.](https://20963905.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20963905/MetalMiner%20Track%20Record.pdf)

# China’s Dominance Remains an Issue

Once again, China controls about 80% of rare earth magnets production. In total, the country produces over 200,000 tons of magnets annually, which accounts for the vast majority of the global supply. In contrast, North America and Europe together manufacture fewer than 2,000 tons, while Japan and Vietnam contribute about 25,000 tons.

https://preview.redd.it/3k7w4jlj2hsf1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbdc8c4571758d0d0952a3cb8bbaa0144df1f1a

Until about six months ago, the supply of these magnets from China to the rest of the world was going on well. Then Beijing decided to pull the plug and suspend exports to some of its key trading partners, including the U.S. and the European Union, in an apparent warning against proposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Since then, China has allowed limited exports, but it still maintains tighter controls to reinforce its geopolitical influence.

# E.U. Import Up, U.S. Down

Now, newly released data shows that the EU’s purchase of rare earth magnets increased in August this year, while imports to the U.S. declined. According to [news agency](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/china-s-magnet-exports-to-eu-surge-as-bloc-bears-brunt-of-crunch) Bloomberg, this points to concerns over resource security, as the European nations face the sharpest strain from tightening global magnet supplies.

https://preview.redd.it/szm1nqgl2hsf1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1509111ebe38ee24f4509b244041abceb7a420

Meanwhile, analysts caution that intensifying trade tensions may further jeopardize access to these critical materials, threatening to derail Europe’s green technology goals and undermine its industrial competitiveness.

In total, exports from China to the EU went up 21% in August, reaching 2,582 tons. At the same time, deliveries to the U.S. dropped 5% month-over-month, touching about 590 tons. The EU’s dependence on these magnets is clearly going north as the data showed that, year-to-date, imports from China had tripled compared to the U.S. According to experts, this serves to underline a larger shift in global supply dynamics.

# New Western Production is Coming, Eventually

For now, it seems China’s dominance in rare earth magnets will continue. According to a [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/business/china-rare-earths-magnets.html) in the New York Times, the U.S. is trying to play catch-up with the Eastern nation. But despite these new efforts, the vast majority of the world’s magnet supply still originates from Chinese refineries.

**The U.S. currently has four domestic magnet factories nearing completion. Meanwhile, in neighboring Canada, Neo Performance Materials just launched a major facility in Narva, Estonia. This site nearly doubles European and the U.S. production capacity and could scale to 5,000 tons. However, the NYT report also states that the full ramp-up will take years.**

North America and Europe collectively purchase close to 40,000 tons of rare earth magnets each year. Therefore, setting up magnet factories in the U.S. and some other countries seems to be one way out of the China predicament.

However, China’s dominance is rooted in decades of investment and near-total control over rare earth processing. It manufactures most of the world’s refining equipment and employs nearly all the specialized technicians. Some analysts say it will take years—even a decade—to break this stranglehold completely.

# Oct. 1st, 2025~U.S. Antimony breaks ground on expansion project

[U.S. Antimony breaks ground on expansion project | Valley Press/Mineral Independent](https://vp-mi.com/news/2025/oct/01/us-antimony-breaks-ground-on-expansion-project/)

[Gov. Gianforte speaking during a groundbreaking ceremony at the USAC facility in Thompson Falls. \(Photo provided\)](https://preview.redd.it/q7qf9kb34hsf1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=140587c53f2110c8ad289f08ce7557199d7985b8)

Gov. Greg Gianforte joined community leaders and executives from United States Antimony Corporation last week to celebrate the groundbreaking on a new expansion at the facility near Thompson Falls.

In 1969, USAC was established in Montana to mine antimony which is a critical mineral for national defense, energy, batteries, ammunition, and semiconductors, according to a media release from the Governor's Office.

The groundbreaking ceremony commemorates the expansion project on the smelter facility that is already underway.

“By producing critical minerals here at home, we are creating good-paying jobs, strengthening our supply chains, and reducing our reliance on foreign sources,” Gianforte said. “This groundbreaking is about more than mining, it’s about Montana leading the way in critical mineral production and safeguarding our national security.”

The smelter can produce up to 15 million pounds of antimony oxide or 5 million pounds of antimony metal annually and refines silver and gold, with monthly capacities of approximately 10,000 ounces of silver and 50 ounces of gold. 

The project includes up to $15 million in capital investment and the creation of 25 new jobs in Sanders County. 

Once completed, the expansion is expected to increase production from 100 tons per month to more than 500 tons, a 400% increase in processing capacity from current levels. 

The Thompson Falls smelter remains as the only facility of its kind in the United States.

With China controlling 85% of the world’s antimony production, Montana’s renewed and continued operations will help secure domestic supply and strengthen U.S. industries. During his comments, the governor underscored the importance of strengthening state and federal support of U.S. companies creating American-made energy.

“We cannot and must not be reliant upon China for these minerals. That’s why President Trump, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and others have made the production of critical minerals like antimony a top priority. With Montana’s rich tradition of mining, we can and should be a national leader,” Gianforte added.

# **USAC was awarded a $245 million contract by the Department of Defense to supply antimony to aid in the replenishment of the National Defense Stockpile that supports the U.S. military.

“This significant expansion, along with new innovations being implemented, underscores USAC's ability to move swiftly in an effort to respond to shifts and demands for not only our industrial customers, but now our U.S. Military,” said Gary C. Evans, Chairman &amp; CEO of USAC.

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement &amp; validation.
* 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 \~BELOW\~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti &amp; TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc &amp; Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $110M— funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. **(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

[Q-4 STACKED CATALYSTS &amp; more....](https://preview.redd.it/gu7tejroehsf1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998524a34bc48c1777837cf3933a652468eb2f8e)

  
🚨 **Breaking: U.S. Government Takes 5% Stake in Lithium Americas** — the precedent is real!

**Washington is no longer just talking about critical minerals; it’s writing checks.** That makes NioCorp’s timing sharper than ever as the only U.S. project with Niobium, Titanium/TiCl₄, Scandium, and REEs all under one roof — a true flagship hub for independence.

With the **Munich conference kicking off Friday, Oct. 3**, Elk Creek has the global stage to showcase its multi-metal profile while government stakes in strategic projects are becoming the new norm. October’s drill results could push TREO tonnage toward the **1,000,000t mark**, feeding directly into the Q4 DFS — which will lock in capex/opex, NPV, RailVeyor efficiencies, and expanded reserves. That DFS is not paperwork; it’s the trigger event for lenders, offtakers, and defense primes to model Elk Creek at full scale.

Add in November’s scandium/alloy announcements, the looming EXIM/DFC final investment decision, Maxim’s raised target to **$12**, and increasing chatter of U.S. government or defense-prime stakes, and the ignition sequence is stacked. Q4 is shaping up as execution and recognition — with Elk Creek lining up to be re-priced as the **multi-metal cornerstone of U.S. resource security.** 🚀

Jim Chalmers has been urged to develop a strategy before propping up under-pressure manufacturers as the Tomago smelter seeks billions of dollars in support.

By Ronald Mizen

5 min. readView original

Two former Productivity Commission bosses say there is a significant risk federal and state governments are held to ransom by uneconomic energy-intensive manufacturers who goad them into expensive taxpayer bailouts.

Peter Harris and Michael Brennan have urged Treasurer Jim Chalmers to use his economic reform agenda to develop a clear strategy for deciding if taxpayer support for under-pressure businesses is the right move over the long term to avoid throwing good money after bad.

A clean energy transformation of Tomago aluminium smelter in NSW faces a sliding doors moment in 2025. Supplied

It comes after *The Australian Financial Review* last month revealed that the Tomago aluminium smelter was in [urgent talks to secure billions of dollars](https://www.afr.com/policy/energy-and-climate/rio-pushes-for-eye-watering-tomago-bailout-20250606-p5m5ih) in support from the NSW and federal governments to save it from failing due to [crippling energy costs.](https://www.afr.com/politics/minns-confirms-talks-to-save-tomago-aluminium-smelter-20250612-p5m6zf)

Meanwhile, the chief executive of Nyrstar this week said the metal processor needed to secure a taxpayer rescue package to ensure the future for its loss-making zinc smelters in South Australia and Tasmania as the company’s [Swiss owner Trafigura weighs whether to close the plants.](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz)

Matt Howell, who took over as head of Nyrstar Australia in January, argued the matter was “urgent” and [could not be put off to the next federal budget.](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/nyrstar-warns-of-urgent-serious-risk-of-smelter-closure-20250626-p5mahs) He cited Labor’s commitment to maintain domestic manufacturing under its signature Future Made in Australia policy as justification for taxpayer funds.

The crisis underlines the financial struggles faced by manufacturers of aluminium, nickel, copper and other metals amid significant declines in treatment and refining revenues, as well as rising energy costs.

Brennan, who led the Productivity Commission from 2018 to 2023 and now heads think tank the e61 Institute, said it was sometimes difficult amid the chaos of a threatened closure and loss of jobs to discern whether something was a good deal and good value for money.

Michael Brennan: “There’s a risk you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies.” Sydney Morning Herald

“There’s always a significant risk governments get held ransom and you get goaded into additional taxpayer subsidies,” he said.

Harris, who chaired the commission between 2013 and 2018, said there was a danger of adding “band-aid upon a band-aid”.

“We’re clearly in danger of not recalling the lessons we’ve learned because we think this is new and mega because Trump’s made it a bigger thing,” he said of the focus on propping up domestic manufacturing under the banner of “resilience”.

# Reform agenda

Resilience, boosting productivity and making the federal budget more sustainable are the three themes of Chalmers’ economic roundtable in Canberra next month, which the treasurer hopes will spark a major reform agenda.

Peter Harris: “We should be working out what is sustainable here.” Australian Financial Review

Both Harris and Brennan said there were circumstances where it might be appropriate to support a business, such as helping it get through a period of unsustainable energy prices or investing in productivity-improving plant.

But there needed to be a clear framework that meant requests were not being dealt with on an ad-hoc basis and provided benefits to taxpayers, rather than just doling out operational cash.

“Things like sovereign capability and resilience can be difficult things to pin down. That’s not to say they’re not important, but what matters is you have a systematic framework by which you think through these things so you’re not hostage to sort of piecemeal, case-by-case crisis decisions,” Brennan said. “What does the taxpayer get in return?”

Harris indicated that politicians often make decisions to solve an immediate political problem without considering more fundamental issues.

“The biggest problem with these things is there needs to be some kind of assessment asking: is it genuinely sustainable if we do what they’re asking us to do, or is it sub-scale and unlikely to be sustainable?” he said.

“Now is the time to turn the Industry Department’s heads away from ‘when opportunity knocks, let’s get some dough,’ to doing the analysis. We should be working out what is sustainable here.”

That meant assessing domestic and international markets to decide whether manufacturers would be viable again or keep needing bailouts. He said it may be appropriate to continue propping up companies supplying the local market for sovereign capability reasons.

# ‘Truly insane’

“You can make the domestic argument, but you certainly can’t make the export argument ... The idea of paying to export something is truly, truly insane. You’ve determined to subsidise foreigners,” Harris said.

Howell said Nyrstar needed assistance to weather “several hundred million” in losses expected over the next two years while the company considers whether it can upgrade the plants to process the critical minerals.

Hundreds of millions of dollars are also required for the rebuild of the Port Pirie smelter in SA, while a $400 million upgrade is needed at the Nyrstar smelter near Hobart. That plant had already secured $70 million of funding from the federal and Tasmanian governments, but work on that project was put on hold by the company late last year due to rising costs.

The $50 million from the federal government was promised by both Labor and the Coalition during the 2022 election campaign.[ The *Financial Review*  has previously revealed](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/coalition-labor-both-promised-50m-to-this-business-no-one-knows-why-20240805-p5jzmz) the responsible department has no record of being asked for the money by the recipient or anyone.

The funds were also promised without a business case, analysis of the value proposition of the project, and no probity advice.

While [Nyrstar has struggled to make a decent return](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/trafigura-wipes-266m-off-its-australian-smelters-20221209-p5c53d), Trafigura in 2022 and 2023 booked profits worth more than $US14 billion ($20 billion), with each year setting a fresh record.

The Tomago aluminium smelter is the nation’s largest electricity user and discussions about its bailout package are focused on the smelter’s electricity contract for 2026 to 2029 and the design of federal Labor’s production tax credits.

“They’re running around in Sydney and Canberra looking for a lot of money,” a source previously told the *Financial Review*. “It’s billions, not hundreds of millions. It’s eye-watering.”

Tomago is 51.6 per cent owned by mining giant Rio Tinto and uses about 10 per cent of NSW’s power supply running around the clock. It employs about 1000 people directly and claims to create as many as 5000 indirect jobs.

The facility, which is also part-owned by CSR and Hydro Aluminium, is the country’s biggest aluminium producer, generating about 590,000 tonnes a year or around 37 per cent of Australia’s primary aluminium.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677526,2025-07-04T06:49:45,Rio Tinto,2025

But behind every shiny product and service, there’s a backbone industry that keeps the economy running. These are called basic industries.

They’re the sectors that provide raw materials, energy, and essential services. Without them, no other industry could function. But the big question is: **how many jobs are available in basic industries in the USA today?** Let’s break it down.

# What Are Basic Industries?

**Basic industries** are the ones that supply raw materials to all other sectors. They don’t make the final product you buy at the store; instead, they produce the essential building blocks.

# Examples of Basic Industries

* **Agriculture** (crops, livestock, food production)
* **Mining** (coal, metals, minerals)
* **Oil &amp; Gas** (exploration, drilling, refining)
* **Forestry** (logging, paper, timber)
* **Steel &amp; Metals** (iron, aluminum, copper)
* **Utilities** (electricity, water, gas distribution)
* **Construction Materials** (cement, wood, glass, stone)

These sectors are called “basic” because without them, advanced industries such as technology, healthcare, or automotive wouldn’t exist.

# How Many Jobs Are Available in Basic Industries in the USA?

According to the **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**, millions of Americans work in basic industries. Here’s a breakdown:

* **Agriculture, food, and related industries** employ over **22 million people** in the U.S. (USDA, 2023). 👉 Source:[ USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/ag-and-food-sectors-and-the-economy/)
* **Mining, quarrying, and oil &amp; gas extraction** employ around **600,000 workers** (BLS, 2024). 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag21.htm)
* **Utilities** employ about **540,000 workers** (BLS, 2023). 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag22.htm)
* **Forestry and logging** employ nearly **50,000 people**. 👉 Source:[ BLS](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/naics3_113000.htm)
* **Construction and industrial specialties** (heavily tied to basic industries) employ over **7.7 million people**. 👉 Source:[ Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/226323/us-construction-employment-since-2000/)

So if we combine agriculture, energy, mining, forestry, utilities, and industrial specialties, the **basic industries sector supports over 30 million U.S. jobs** in total.

# Is Basic Industries a Good Career Path?

Yes — and here’s why:

* **Stability** → These jobs provide essentials (food, energy, raw materials). They’ll never disappear.
* **Growth** → Renewable energy, eco-farming, and advanced manufacturing are expanding.
* **Diverse entry points** → You don’t always need a degree. Many jobs start with trade school, apprenticeships, or on-the-job training.
* **Pay potential** → Skilled roles like petroleum engineer or power plant operator earn six figures.

# Best Paying Jobs in Basic Industries

Not all basic industry jobs are low-paying. Some pay six figures, especially in oil, gas, and utilities.

Here are **examples of the best-paying jobs in basic industries**:

* **Petroleum Engineer** → Average salary: **$131,800/year** (BLS).
* **Chemical Engineer** → Average salary: **$105,500/year**.
* **Industrial Production Manager** → Average salary: **$103,000/year**.
* **Power Plant Operator** → Average salary: **$94,790/year**.
* **Mining and Geological Engineer** → Average salary: **$100,090/year**.
* **Agricultural Manager** → Average salary: **$75,760/year**.

👉 These jobs often pay more than many office jobs in other industries.

# What Do Basic Industries Jobs Pay on Average?

If you’re not in a top role like an engineer or manager, salaries are still competitive. On average:

* Entry-level roles (farming, logging, construction helpers): **$30,000 – $45,000/year**.
* Skilled trades (welders, electricians, machine operators): **$45,000 – $70,000/year**.
* Advanced professionals (engineers, plant managers, supervisors): **$80,000 – $130,000/year**.

So, depending on your skill level, you can earn anywhere from **$15/hr to six figures annually**.

# Jobs in Basic Industries (Salary Breakdown)

Here’s a **comprehensive list of jobs** across different basic industries — more detailed than Indeed’s version:

# Agriculture &amp; Food

# How Many Jobs Are Available in Industrial Specialties?

Industrial specialties include construction, mechanical work, plant operations, and industrial engineering.

* In the U.S., there are **7.7 million jobs in construction** (Statista, 2024).
* Industrial engineers alone hold about **350,000 jobs**.
* Skilled trades like welders, machinists, and electricians have **hundreds of thousands of open positions**.

So the answer: **Millions of jobs exist in industrial specialties in the U.S. today.**

# How Many Posts Are There in an Industry?

When people ask this, they usually mean: **how many types of jobs exist in one industry?**

In basic industries, the number is massive. For example:

* Agriculture → farmers, food scientists, farm equipment operators, agronomists.
* Mining → drill operators, geologists, engineers, safety officers.
* Utilities → electricians, line installers, power plant operators, supervisors.
* Forestry → loggers, environmental scientists, conservation officers.

Each industry has **dozens of unique posts** across different skill levels.

597,1loy9la,Why does Software/Computer Science pay more than traditional/mechanical engineering?,confusedneedhelp2,/r/careerguidance/comments/1loy9la/why_does_softwarecomputer_science_pay_more_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1loy9la/why_does_softwarecomputer_science_pay_more_than/,0,10,1751366109.0,"Main question is to discuss but also tell me what I offer should pick?

Hello, So Ive been lucky to get multiple job offers I can take as a recent university graduate, I did a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. So the offers I received for the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms everyone knows and puts on a pedestal as well as the mining engineering Fly in fly out offer.

Second path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical/mining engineering roles offered.

I’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pay for mechanical/traditional engineers at the same top company FAANG was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path.

Thanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role

But I’m just really curious to why this is the case even matching at a top company so it’s a bit more even the software/tech engineers get paid more than the traditional/mechanical engineers like even from levels fyi and from my own experiences and offers and friends/acquaintances have told.
Even my dad is a team lead in mining engineering as a mining engineer yet my Software Engineering offer at FAANG pays more than that which is crazy.

TLDR, FAANG software engineering offer laid 130k more than my highest traditional engineering offers which included mechanical and mining engineering job offers at top firms for traditional engineers such as Boeing, Defence and Rio Tinto. Also FAANG offered me interview and salary for Software Engineer and Mechanical Engineer role but the Software Engineering role still paid significantly higher so I just went with that.

My only gripe with not going with the software engineering job is that I won’t be seen as a real engineer by my family even though I’d earn more than them so I need help please guys with convincing my family too",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677908,2025-07-01T20:35:09,Rio Tinto,2025

**IWM up again in premarket. Is at the 52w high resistance, after big breakout. Calls build on 215 and 220 in the positioning data. If we can hold this 211.88 52w high level, we head higher to 215+.**

[https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25](https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25) 

**Similarly Traders bet on return to 52w highs on TNA. Leveraged small caps so beware of that.**

[https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE](https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE) 

**I think the IWM, small cap buy case is strong. I was in from before CPI as I thought it was too bearish and would see squeeze. But I think CPI and unemployment data is now pointing to sept rate cut. I think Trump winning is bullish for Small caps too. I think there's reasons there for IWM to run**

**VIX: Slight spike yesterday, but traders are still V short volatility, with vix in contango. V much skewed to ITM puts. Traders will try to crush VIX again.**

[https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M](https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M) 

Dow Jones positioning also looks bullish, with my target at 40k.

**Rotation we saw yesterday is normal given soft inflation print, which makes chance of rate cuts more likely. Hence traders rotated from mag7 into interest rate sensitive IWM. But there's no panic in markets, credit default swaps plunged, hence conditions bullish Traders will buy back Mag7 too soon.**

Some MAG7 more bullish than others. MSFT&lt; AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL the most bullish. NVDA somewhat. TSLA less so, as we see traders take profits. Its normal though given they had the robotaxi news, not just rotation. 

GOLD AND OIL POSITIONING ARE BULLISH AFTER CPI. 



DATA LEDE:

CHINA BALANCE OF TRADE data showed stronger than expected exports, up 8.6% vs 8% expected. Stronger global demand. 

However, still weak domestic demand, as imports fell -2.3% vs 2.8% expected.

German wholesale prices come in at -0.3% MOM vs 0.2% expected. 

US PPI coming premarket.

US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Numbers and Inflation expectation numbers after market opens. 



YESTERDAY CPI REVIEW: Overall a v bullish CPI print, which supports September cut imo. This coupled with labour market data means Fed shouldn’t hesitate to cut rates. 

Lowest Y/Y CPI print since March 2021

First M/M decrease since May 2020. Down -0.1% vs expectation of 0.1% increase. 

Shelter component had smallest increase since Aug 2021

The drop in airline fares was corroborated by Delta airline earnings. 



MARKETS:

WE SAW PROFIT TAKING ON SPX AND NASDAQ YESTERDAY AS TRADERS ROTATED INTO SMALL CAPS WHICH HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. 

SPX sold off form 5640 to 5577, before recovering slightly. Is currently trading at 5592. Just lost the gains from Wednesdays move. 

NASDAQ: Bigger sell off, as is more heavily weighted to the Mag7, which saw the most selling. Dropped from 20,700 to 20200. Flat here. 

Dow Jones: Moving higher, confirmed breakout, moved up to 39,800. Next target looks like 40k

GER40: European markets higher after soft CPI yesterday. 

Chinese market higher from the added restrictions on short selling which is an artificial support of the HKG market, also following US CPI hence supporting lower rates in US which helps chinese exports. 

Nikkei drops after hitting ATH earlier in the week. 

GOLD moving higher above 2400 after soft CPI

Oil recovering, positioning improving after Dollar weakness from CPI lead to recovery. 

VIX - jumped yesterday, but traders still v short on vix, hence we probably see sell off again.

599,1l2yb4l,Has the once premier Treasury department lost its mojo?,Leland-Gaunt-,/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1l2yb4l/has_the_once_premier_treasury_department_lost_its/,https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/influential-or-enfeebled-has-treasury-lost-its-mojo-20250527-p5m2p2,1,11,1749017603.0,"When Ted Evans ran the federal Treasury in the 1990s, the former telephone linesman spoke in a whisper, but he wasn’t shy of speaking truth to power. When he really wanted to make a point, he sometimes tapped his fist on the table.

“No minister, you cannot do that,” Evans told treasurers and assistant treasurers, several past officials say. His successor, Ken Henry, delivered a [scathing assessment](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-jdx1w) of Howard government climate and water policies in front of the entire department’s staff in 2007, calling them “frankly bad”.

Such fierce displays of independence are unthinkable for today’s Treasury, a sign of how much the department and politics have changed.

For much of its 124-year history, Treasury has been a driving force behind economic policies that have made Australians among the richest in the world: far-reaching tax changes, balancing the budget, freeing financial and job markets, championing competition and selling government assets.

Treasury’s advice guided the nation through shocks including the [2008 global financial crisis](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/how-australia-learned-the-wrong-lessons-from-the-gfc-20230913-p5e4bs) and [2020 pandemic](https://www.afr.com/politics/how-the-pandemic-changed-australia-in-2020-in-9-charts-20221201-p5c2tf), in lockstep with the Reserve Bank of Australia.

Alongside the departments of prime minister, finance and foreign affairs, Treasury sits at the apex of the public service and has traditionally attracted the brightest economic policy minds.

From their grand building inside Canberra’s rarefied parliamentary triangle, Treasury officers have been trusted advisers to prime ministers and treasurers and staunch defenders of the public interest.

“Economic rationalism” ruled the day in Treasury’s golden age in the 1980s and 90s. That meant controlling government spending, advocating tax reform, opposing government interventions and promoting free markets.

“Treasury’s contribution to the life, the development and the growth of our nation is far-reaching and long-lasting,” Evans wrote to mark the centenary of the Treasury in 2001. “That contribution reflects the several generations of Treasury people, public servants, who have assisted the governments of the day to improve the lot of all Australians.″⁣

But Treasury exceptionalism is now in question. Government spending, outside the pandemic, is the highest in 40 years. Despite huge revenue windfalls from Australia’s 20-year [mining boom](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5kywb), federal debt is about to blow through $1 trillion due to pandemic stimulus and a spending [surge led](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5kq5d) by the $50 billion National Disability Insurance Scheme. A [decade of budget deficits](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/debt-hits-seven-year-low-before-decade-of-deficits-20241001-p5kf03) is forecast.

Productivity growth is the [worst in 60 years](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5lx9u). There has been no substantive tax reform in 25 years. Governments are more willing to intervene in the economy, re-regulating labour markets and subsidising industries with billions of dollars in taxpayer money.

All of this has led to questions about the waning influence of the traditional premier department of government. An uncomfortable question is now being whispered in Canberra: “What’s happened to Treasury?”

*The Australian Financial Review* has spoken to more than 30 current and former Treasury officials, former treasurers and economic policy experts to understand what is going on and how the department has changed. Some spoke anonymously to speak frankly or because most public servants are not authorised to speak publicly.

Has the Treasury lost its hard economic rationalist edge? Is the problem not with the Treasury itself but its political masters? Does Treasury’s decline simply mirror the broader public service since John Howard’s “[night of the long knives](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5l9pv)” in 1996 when six department secretaries were sacked, putting a chill over frank and fearless advice? Can Treasury compete with investment banks and consultants for the best talent?

In a post-pandemic political backdrop of big spending, [entitlement and policy cowardice](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5lwx0), the answers are important not only for the institution but also for the country because a strong and influential Treasury is crucial to the nation’s wellbeing.

Former treasurer Peter Costello says the Treasury should be above the political influence of the treasurer of the day. Eamon Gallagher

“Treasury should be a great department of state,” says Peter Costello, the Liberal treasurer from 1996 to 2007 when Evans and Henry were secretary.

Treasury, he says, must be above the political whims of the treasurer of the day and the immediate political cycle.

“It is not there to do short-term political bidding of the treasurer, or worse, for his political office.

“He should do that for himself.”

Under Treasurer Jim Chalmers and secretary Steven Kennedy, Treasury has proposed taxing [unrealised gains](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5m1hn) in superannuation, defended income tax [bracket creep](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5ldpj), backed imposing temporary price caps on coal and gas and argued that subsidies for household energy bills help reduce inflation.

These interventions are not positions that Treasury would have backed in earlier decades, say experienced officials. Henry has criticised taxing unrealised gains, while economists have disputed that subsidies can sustainably lower inflation.

Alex Sanchez, a former senior economic adviser to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, was underwhelmed by Treasury during his three years in government.

“You would expect Treasury to be more aggressive on the economic challenges we have: low-cost \[emissions\] abatement. Dismal productivity. A broken tax system and the relentless growth in the state,” he says.

“Instead we have an enfeebled institution which sees the cost of these problems transferred to Australians.”

&gt;

Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy and Treasurer Jim Chalmers in May 2022. 

**Chalmers and Kennedy speak most working days**. The treasurer and the man regarded as the most powerful bureaucrat in Canberra first crossed paths during the 2008 global financial crisis.

Chalmers, then 30, was a political adviser to treasurer Wayne Swan, and Kennedy, about 15 years older, had been seconded from Treasury to prime minister Kevin Rudd’s office. The government took Henry’s advice to “go hard, go early and go households” with a $50 billion stimulus and guarantee for banks.

After the crisis, Swan initiated the last attempt at major tax reform, a review led by Henry, finalised amid an iron ore price boom. But the botched attempt to introduce a mining super profits tax, which was comprehensively defeated by big miners BHP and Rio Tinto, burned Swan and contributed to Rudd losing his job.

But today, Chalmers is a strident defender of the Treasury. He says no one in parliament has a more substantial appreciation of the department than him.

“It’s well-led, deeply and centrally engaged, respected and influential, cerebral and consequential,” Chalmers says.

“There’s not a major decision taken anywhere in our government or indeed any government that doesn’t take its advice into consideration in one way or another.”

Chalmers is a left-of-centre Labor treasurer. In a defining essay in 2023, [*Capitalism after the crises*](https://www.themonthly.com.au/february-2023/essays/capitalism-after-crises), he proposed a grand vision for “values-based capitalism”, seen as a [shift away](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5cg93) from economic rationalist orthodoxy. He wrote about revamping the nation’s long-standing market-based economic model and attacked “neoliberalism”.

Kennedy’s sympathies are also towards progressive policies. A psychiatric nurse earlier in his career, he cares deeply about climate change – for which he received the public service medal in 2016 – full employment and inequality. Kennedy is more comfortable with bigger government than past Treasury bosses.

Kennedy has told colleagues that he prefers to be completely frank with treasurers – in private. He does not believe in running debates that could embarrass Chalmers, or his predecessor Josh Frydenberg, in public. That makes it difficult for outsiders to judge Treasury advice to the government because it is deliberately confidential.

“The way I tend to approach Treasury is I want it to be relevant and influential to the decisions that the government is going to take,” Kennedy says*.*

But he insists that Treasury forms its own views and remains at arms length from the elected government.

“Of course, we’re a part of the executive, but we form our advice independently, and that’s what we focus on,” he says.

“We won’t be directed by the government of either persuasion. We will sit down, and we will form our advice independently.

“Certainly, you could criticise us that, you might think our advice is not as influential as it might be. I accept that could be the case.”

Treasury pushed back against Albanese’s $8.5 billion election promise on Medicare and resisted his push to subsidise domestic-made solar panels, a senior official from another department says. But Albanese proceeded anyway.

Another official says Treasury and the Department of Finance initially in 2022 suggested tougher budget rules, more substantial spending cuts and revenue measures, but there was no political appetite from the government.

The rejections have made officials more cautious about recommending budget savings because they know that despite their many hours of work developing savings they are unlikely to be adopted, one of the officials says.

Elected ministers are not obliged to follow the Treasury advice. But they do need to consider it and work with the public service, so the system doesn’t break down.

&gt;

While Chalmers and Kennedy are considered ideologically and professionally aligned, a senior bureaucrat says Kennedy has sometimes come under enormous pressure from the treasurer and the relationship is not as easy as it may appear.

Chalmers and his office have pressed Kennedy to talk up the disinflationary effect of government subsidies for energy bill rebates in speeches and in the budget papers.

“It’s sometimes hard to know if it’s Steven himself or the words of Jim ringing in his ears,” one observer says.

Like Evans, Kennedy is softly spoken. Some officials turn up the volume on their hearing aids when he speaks at group meetings.

He does not appear to enjoy conflict or tension. “Steven hates confrontation,” a former senior official says.

Chalmers [can be a robust personality with public servants behind closed doors](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/cold-controlled-anger-jim-chalmers-battle-to-control-the-narrative-20250212-p5lbmu), including RBA governors Michele Bullock and predecessor Philip Lowe.

Others say Kennedy is not averse to delivering difficult messages to Chalmers in private.

“Steven hasn’t always toed the line completely with Jim and Jim doesn’t like that,” a senior government official says.

Kennedy has led the department since 2019, and has been praised by both sides of politics. He is respected by Scott Morrison and Frydenberg for his work, particularly during the pandemic.

Kennedy was a key player in the Coalition’s unprecedented $300 billion stimulus in response to the pandemic. This included the $89 billion JobKeeper wage subsidy, $30 billion in cash flow support for businesses, $2.6 billion HomeBuilder program, and billions more for unemployment benefits and healthcare.

The stimulus was hailed by many economists for rescuing the economy during pandemic lockdowns. But it faced criticism for wasting money on profitable companies and contributing to an inflation surge.

Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn has spent many hours speaking to Kennedy since the “Team Australia” response to the COVID crisis and on a range of other economic matters.

“I think he’s smart, pragmatic and constructive,” Comyn says. “He’s spoken publicly about the challenge of fiscal sustainability and the importance of national security and resilience.”

Since the pandemic, Kennedy has been influential in pushing the government and RBA to target a lower unemployment rate. As a result, the jobless rate is a low 4.1 per cent and inflation is back inside the RBA’s 2 per cent to 3 per cent target band, an historic achievement.

A former RBA board member says Kennedy has served both sides of politics with distinction and honesty.

“He will privately explain the government’s view and his own view, and distinguish between the two where necessary,” the board member says.

Peter Downes has known Kennedy since the 1990s, when Kennedy worked at the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

“Steve is extraordinarily hardworking, honest and dedicated to the national interest,” says Downes, director of Canberra-based Outlook Economics.

“Probably the most striking impression I have was how hard he worked when COVID hit.

“We’ve never seen anything like that before, outside of war, and he worked himself to the point of collapse.”

A key ambition for Kennedy is to keep Treasury relevant. He has told colleagues that Treasury under Henry was more akin to a “think tank”, whereas today it has “influence”, according to people who have recently worked at Treasury.

This is not a criticism of Henry but reflects that after the introduction of the GST in the early 2000s, there was little further reform happening under Howard once the mining boom took off, so Treasury had more idle resources to research big issues.

“I think he figures it is better to be inside the room, than being so hardline that you become irrelevant and are frozen out,” one observer says.

Treasurer Paul Keating famously froze out his outspoken Treasury boss, John Stone, in the early 1980s. There were periods when they did not talk to each other.

Keating stopped listening to Stone, going [around his back](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54j7m) with other officials to float the dollar in 1983 against Stone’s wishes. “Under John Stone, Treasury always said ‘no’ and became irrelevant,” journalist Robert Gottliebsen [recalled](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-kaiy1) in 1989.

The modern Treasury is more pragmatic and less hardline than in the past. A former senior Treasury official, who has served Labor and Coalition treasurers, backs Kennedy’s desire to operate within the “art of the possible”.

“You have to give frank and fearless advice, but not to the point of going to war with the minister and becoming irrelevant,” the retired official says. “You have to keep lines of communication open.”

But another former Treasury veteran now working at another department at a senior level laments that advice provided to governments is not as independent and frank as it was a couple of decades ago.

“In my observation the political class these days on both sides is increasingly sensitive about receiving critical advice and as a consequence, the bureaucracy pulls its punches,” the veteran says.

“You can be frank and fearless but will pretty quickly be sidelined, or you can heavily tailor advice but then this gives governments cover or even encouragement to do what we know is bad policy.”",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.677992,2025-06-04T16:13:23,RT,2025

**Trade fights meet tech hype.**  New U.S. tariffs and the coming Nvidia earnings drop investors into a tug-of-war between protectionism and AI-fuelled optimism.

• Tariffs on Indian textiles, jewelry and auto parts—and Europe’s fear of resource nationalism—darken the export outlook, while Asian and European traders watch for potential Fed rate cuts and Nvidia’s numbers with the S&amp;P 500 at record highs.

*Why it matters:* Higher barriers risk choking global goods flow just as shale expansion (Saudi, Argentina, China) and AI capex ramp up.  Small businesses stay upbeat, yet workers worry AI will make job losses permanent—an economic split policymakers can’t ignore.

601,1ku6jvh,Murray Watt’s first task as environment minister,CommonwealthGrant,/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1ku6jvh/murray_watts_first_task_as_environment_minister/,https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/environment/2025/05/24/murray-watts-first-task-environment-minister,19,9,1748074366.0,"Murray Watt, known for his effectiveness, is confident he can deliver long-delayed environmental reform. His first and most consequential task is the ‘carbon bomb’ project awaiting approval. By Mike Seccombe.

Murray Watt’s appointment as environment minister gives Kelly O’Shanassy a measure of hope.

“I do think that he’s a good appointment,” says the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, “because he has a reputation for fixing really hard things.”

It’s true. Watt has come to be seen as one of the government’s foremost fixers, prepared to take on powerful, even dangerous, vested interests. As agriculture minister he took on the farming lobby and steered legislation through parliament, ending the live sheep export trade.

As minister for employment and workplace relations, he pushed through laws cracking down on corruption in the construction industry, involving bikie gangs and the CFMEU, over the objections of that union and others with strong links to the Labor Party. He was given extra police protection at the time.

Now, though, he confronts an even more intractable – if less physically dangerous – problem: reforming Australia’s main national environment law.

The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, legislated in 1999 by the Howard government, has been, to quote the prominent businessman and former Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman Graeme Samuel, “an abysmal failure”.

In October 2019 then environment minister Sussan Ley appointed Samuel and an expert panel to review the EPBC Act. A year later the Samuel review came back with a damning report and called for a radical overhaul.

Among its 38 recommendations were: legally binding national standards to protect wildlife, critical habitats and heritage sites; independent oversight and enforcement of those standards; the prioritisation of Indigenous engagement and protection of cultural heritage; better data collection; and reform of the environmental offsets regime, which did not adequately protect critical habitat from development.

Nothing came of it. Just as nothing came of a previous independent review by eminent bureaucrat Allan Hawke 10 years earlier.

“EPBC reform has been promised, and not been delivered, for nearly a decade and a half now,” says O’Shanassy.

Now it has been promised again. As an indication of his intent to get it done this time, the prime minister has appointed the fixer. And as an indication of his intent, Watt almost immediately jetted off to Western Australia, a state whose Labor government stymied the most recent reform effort.

“I wanted to make Western Australia my first interstate trip,” he tells The Saturday Paper from Perth on Wednesday.

“You know, obviously there are some major decisions pending about projects, but my main job, as I see it, in this role, is to shepherd through reforms to the EPBC legislation. And I think everyone recognises that those laws were a particular flashpoint in Western Australia.”

His trip west was a whirlwind of consultations: with Premier Roger Cook, with various state ministers whose responsibilities intersect with his, with mining groups, business groups, environment advocates and First Nations organisations.

The breadth of Watt’s engagement with environmental organisations is impressive; among them O’Shanassy’s venerable ACF, as well as the Pew Charitable Trusts, Marine Conservation Society, Greenpeace, WWF and the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation, chaired by former Treasury secretary and banker Ken Henry.

“I’ve very deliberately chosen to meet a broad range of stakeholders because I’m genuinely interested in everyone’s point of view on these reforms,” he says.

“I’m committed to being seen as an honest broker.”

How he comes to be judged will of course depend in substantial part on whether or not he can land those reforms. Initial impressions, however, will depend on another decision he must take first. Watt has committed to making a call by the end of this month on a proposal to extend the life of Woodside Energy’s North West Shelf fossil gas project to 2070, which will in turn facilitate the opening up of new gas fields in the Browse Basin.

“It is a slow-moving Juukan Gorge. If you want any credibility on First Nations rights in Australia, you really cannot be approving this gas processing plant.”

If he waves it through, he will effectively detonate what O’Shanassy calls a “carbon bomb”, which will release the equivalent of an estimated 4.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is roughly 10 times Australia’s current total yearly emissions.

Watt nevertheless considers his “main job” to be reform of the EPBC Act.

Political machinations have always trumped environmental concerns, most risibly in 2022 when – literally on election eve – Labor’s shadow minister, Terri Butler, under challenge by the Greens in her Brisbane seat of Griffith, promised that, if elected, Labor would establish an independent environment protection agency. She lost her seat, although Labor won the election.

In what was widely seen as a vindictive act, the new prime minister, Anthony Albanese, appointed his leadership rival Tanya Plibersek to the environment portfolio.

Last November, Plibersek was close to striking a deal with the Greens and independent Senator David Pocock to get legislation through the Senate establishing an EPA. The Greens had dropped a demand for a climate trigger to be incorporated in the so-called Nature Positive legislation.

This was a big concession on the Greens’ part. A climate trigger would have meant proposed developments would have been assessed on the basis of their greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on climate change. There was an agreement in writing.

Without first informing Plibersek, however, Albanese summoned the then Greens leader Adam Bandt and environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young to tell them the deal was off.

Premier Roger Cook claimed credit for pranging it, in the interests of his state’s powerful mining industry.

Just ahead of this year’s election, Albanese also shot a large hole in the EPBC Act to protect the Tasmanian salmon farming industry.

Under the law, the environment minister had the power to reconsider a decision to permit an activity if “substantial new information” came to light about its environmental impact. Conservation groups had called for such a reconsideration, on the basis that industrial fish farming in Tasmania’s Macquarie Harbour threatened the extinction of the Maugean skate.

In order to prevent the loss of a relative handful of jobs in the industry and to improve Labor’s chances of winning a couple of seats in north-west Tasmania, the government pushed through legislation to amend the EPBC Act, severely limiting the reconsideration power. Environmental lawyers say the change has implications far beyond the fish-farming industry.

The net result is that despite Plibersek’s efforts, Australia’s environment laws were arguably even weaker at the end of the Albanese government’s first term than they were at the start, when they already were clearly in urgent need of repair. As the 2021 state of the environment report summarised, conditions were “poor and deteriorating as a result of increasing pressures from climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and resource extraction.”

Says O’Shanassy: “There’s an extinction crisis. More than 2000 species, plants and animals are threatened with extinction.”

This is the mess Watt inherits.

Under Plibersek, the reform process was broken into several tranches, an approach that was opposed by environment groups, for good reason.

The bills Plibersek failed to get through parliament last year aimed to create two new bodies to inform decisions – Environment Protection Australia and Environment Information Australia – and establish better compliance and enforcement mechanisms. But as Justine Bell-James, an expert in environmental law at the University of Queensland, wrote in The Conversation this week, “the centrepiece of the initial reforms – the new environmental standards themselves – were missing”.

O’Shanassy seconds this criticism.

“We certainly prefer the reforms to be done together,” says O’Shanassy, “because they’re interconnected. If you create a national EPA without creating national environmental standards – which are essentially the rules that determine nature protection – then the EPA is going to be overseeing a broken act.

“So our big ask of Murray is to get this done this year and make sure that we’ve got an EPA \[with\] national environmental standards.”

It appears that is what Watt intends to do.

“One thing I am considering is whether we broaden out the reforms beyond what was in the bill that we put to the parliament,” he says. “There seems to be quite a degree of support for doing that, across the spectrum.”

“What was known as stage three of the reforms would have picked up things like setting national environmental standards … streamlining approvals processes, trying to eliminate duplication between the federal government and the state processes. So they’re the types of things that could potentially be rolled in to a broader package.”

Watt suggests the post-election political climate might be conducive to more sweeping reform given the changes to the leadership of both the Greens and Liberal Party.

“Sussan Ley was the minister for the environment who commissioned the Samuel review, that really kickstarted this reform process and if you look back at what she said at the time, you’d be able to find statements from her that she was supportive of the reforms. She wanted to legislate for national environmental standards,” he says.

“Equally, I’ve noticed the comments from Larissa Waters, as the new Greens leader, that she wants to be a bit more constructive with the government than what we saw under Adam Bandt.”

One thing Watt definitely won’t do, though, is incorporate in the reforms a “climate trigger” that would require the assessment process to consider the greenhouse gas emissions of new projects.

Interestingly, right back at the start, 13 environment ministers ago, the main architect of the EPBC Act, then Liberal senator Robert Hill, wanted the legislation to include a such a mechanism, which he called a “greenhouse trigger”.

An almighty fight ensued. Powerful members of the Howard government’s right wing, principally Nationals leader John Anderson and industry minister Nick Minchin, along with industry groups, were vehemently opposed.

Hill lost the battle, but proposals for a climate trigger have since been periodically revived. The Greens tried to amend the EPBC Act to include it in 2020 and again 2022, without success. The Labor shadow environment minister, one Anthony Albanese, introduced a private member’s bill, the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Climate Change Trigger) bill 2005.

It was, frankly, not a terribly ambitious proposal, in that it would have required only proposed developments emitting more than 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent a year to be assessed for their climate change impact as part of any approval process.

In any case, it lapsed.

Watt argues the government’s safeguard mechanism, which requires big emitters of greenhouse gases to progressively lower those emissions, has gone “a long way” towards achieving the same end.

“We do think the safeguard mechanism really achieves a lot of what people are seeking from a climate trigger,” he says.

This is only a partial truth, however, based on the way in which carbon emissions are accounted for under international climate change reduction agreements, says O’Shanassy.

“The safeguard mechanism only addresses scope one and two emissions – domestic emissions in Australia – not the emissions coming from burning our coal and gas overseas. That’s the knockout punch for nature,” she says.

The logic of her argument is unassailable. Greenhouse gas emissions do not respect international borders. Burning of Australia-sourced fossil fuels has the same impact on the environment – including in Australia – regardless of where it takes place.

In the case of the North West Shelf proposal, for example, the WA government granted approval on the basis that domestic emissions would progressively phase down to zero by 2050 – in part through the purchase of carbon offsets – and would total less than 140 million tonnes.

That’s a lot, but it is dwarfed by the amount of greenhouse gas that would result from the burning of that gas overseas. The West Australian EPA’s approval document calculated that would be “approximately” 80.19 million tonnes everyyear, out to 2070.

The safeguard mechanism might ensure that Woodside meets its domestic reduction obligations but it does nothing about the global impact of its massive greenhouse gas emissions.

The distinction made between emissions produced by the burning of Australian fossil fuels domestically and abroad is so obviously artificial, O’Shanassy says, “that at some point in time we’re going to win that in the court of law”.

Be that as it may, the impact of the extension of the North West Shelf project on the global climate will not factor in Watt’s decision, to be announced by May 31.

Watt politely but firmly refuses to talk about it, although he acknowledges it is a matter of enormous interest. “If you believe the local media, I’ve been here to talk about and consult people about the North West Shelf. In fact, I’ve explicitly said to people in meetings that I can’t discuss that,” he says.

“I haven’t met with the Western Australian Conservation Council and I haven’t met with Woodside because, you know, each of them have got various applications in for this decision and it’s not appropriate for me to meet at this point in time.”

Nor, he says, is it appropriate even to mention the pros and cons of the proposal. But he does tacitly acknowledge one big con, when I raise it.

The Burrup Peninsula, on which the Woodside gas hub sits, is the site of what is probably the world’s largest collection of rock art, more than a million petroglyphs across an area of more than 37,000 hectares, some of them 40,000 or more years old.

The Murujuga petroglyphs are rapidly being degraded by emissions of nitrogen oxides and “volatile organic compounds” from the Woodside plant. In its report to the WA government, the state’s Environmental Protection Authority warned of potential “serious or irreversible damage to rock art from industrial air emissions”.

It said the extension should be conditional on Woodside cutting those emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2030.

That’s not enough, says O’Shanassy, noting opposition by traditional owners of the land to the extension of the project.

“It is a slow-moving Juukan Gorge,” she says, referencing Rio Tinto’s destruction of ancient rock shelters in 2020. “If you want any credibility on First Nations rights in Australia, you really cannot be approving this gas processing plant.”

The Australian government nominated Murujuga Cultural Landscape for inscription on the World Heritage List January 2023. A decision is due to be made by UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee in July.

The government, Watt says, is “absolutely committed to seeking World Heritage listing of what is a very special and important place”.

We’ll know soon enough whether he prefers jobs, mining company profits and government tax revenues to ancient culture and global climate. The portents don’t look good on this issue, O’Shanassy concedes.

If he grants Woodside its extension, she says, “it would be devastating, particularly for the traditional owners of Murujuga, but for everyone who needs to live on the planet.

“But we can’t blame Murray Watt. It’s the Labor Party’s policy to support fossil fuels.”

She will still think him a good choice as minister. “We do need a serious reformer and by all accounts that’s what Murray Watt is.”

For his part, Watt is prepared to wear opprobrium in this portfolio, as he has in his previous jobs. That is the fixer’s lot.

“I do see this role as being, if you like, a guardian of Australia’s natural environment, while also having responsibility for facilitating sustainable development, given my role in granting or rejecting approvals. It’s a really contested space politically,” he says.

“Every big decision I make, I know that I’m going to be making some people unhappy, whichever way I go, but that’s just … that’s the role.”

605,1ml5o41,"Inside NexMetals’ ($NEXM) August 8 Newsletter: Roadmap for Selebi Mine’s Comeback &amp; Potential 5,000 Jobs as Botswana Diversifies From Diamonds into Copper &amp; Nickel",Cynophilis,/r/wallstreetsmallcaps/comments/1ml5o41/inside_nexmetals_nexm_august_8_newsletter_roadmap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetsmallcaps/comments/1ml5o41/inside_nexmetals_nexm_august_8_newsletter_roadmap/,4,1,1754683807.0,"NexMetals’ CEO Morgan Lekstrom laid out a clear vision in their latest newsletter: reboot the historic Selebi Mines, bring high-grade copper-nickel back into production, and breathe new life into Selebi Phikwe. Here’s what stood out — and why you might want to be paying attention to $NEXM:

**1. Selebi’s Legacy + Community Impact**

•	From Boom to Bust: Selebi Phikwe once thrived on its copper-nickel mill, supporting 5,000+ jobs and fueling schools, shops and families for decades. When the mine closed in 2016, the town’s economy took a huge hit.

•	Social License Front-and-Center: Restarting Selebi isn’t just about ounces—it’s about bringing jobs and opportunity back to a 52,000-person community. NexMetals already employs 300+ local experts to lead the revival.

**2. Infrastructure = De-Risked Restart**

•	Selebi Main (Shaft #2): 375 m vertical shaft with conveyor decline down to 850 m.

•	Selebi North (Shaft #4): 745 m shaft plus a 7° ramp extending to 900 m for truck access.

•	Surface Footprint: Power (220 kV substation), water, roads, rail spur—and even the operational local airport is all ready and active; just waiting for a comeback. All of it vastly shortens the timeline and lowers the capital needed to restart.

**3. High-Grade, Large-Scale Resources**

•	2024 NI 43-101 MRE:

o	Selebi Main: 18.89 Mt @ 3.51% CuEq (Inferred)

o	Selebi North: 3.00 Mt @ 2.92% CuEq (Indicated) + 5.83 Mt @ 3.11% CuEq (Inferred)

•	Those are some of the highest copper-equivalent grades you’ll find in a permitted, past-producing asset.

**4. Seasoned Leadership Driving Execution**

•	Morgan Lekstrom (CEO): 17+ years in mining, led NexGold’s turnaround, technical roles at Freeport &amp; Rio Tinto, and engineering oversight on major projects.

•	Sharon Taylor (VP Exploration): EM-geophysics pro who spent years at Falconbridge, Noranda &amp; Xstrata.

•	Sean Whiteford (President): Ex-BHP &amp; Rio Tinto geologist steering all technical work in Botswana.

•	Boris Kamstra (COO): Civil engineer/MBA with 25+ years delivering mines across Africa.

**5. Catalysts on the Horizon**

•	Aggressive Drilling: Recent intercepts in the 2 km hinge zone have returned exceptionally high grades (4 %+ CuEq) over substantial widths. Drilling to prove out theory that Selebi North connects with Selebi Main.

606,1kwbnja,We all can make India Self-Reliant - some ideas - Embraer etc,Accomplished-Soft644,/r/BJPSupremacy/comments/1kwbnja/we_all_can_make_india_selfreliant_some_ideas/,https://i.redd.it/q6um6znob83f1.png,28,6,1748310912.0,"Reason: Reg. future war preperation - we wont get time later.  We need atleast 3 years to get these things in place and started production and export.

Since 2014, **Modiji has pushed key reforms that laid groundwork for India’s manufacturing growth. Digital India and the Single Window clearance system cut bureaucratic delays, speeding approvals and improving ease of doing business—India jumped from 142nd to 63rd in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking**.

PM Modiji and all Minister have done excellent work since 2014. Issue was mostly at bureaucratic levels.

**Modiji should personally monitor (using digital records) of top 100 major Private companies starting in India and help them in case any babus create issues**.

The Skill India mission trained over 10 million workers, boosting workforce readiness for industry. Make in India and Industrial Corridor projects like DMIC improved infrastructure and attracted $80+ billion in FDI between 2014 and 2023. GST unified taxes across states, reducing compliance costs by an estimated 20%. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have already led to $25 billion in incremental domestic manufacturing investment.

These efforts combined have increased manufacturing’s share of GDP from 15% to about 17% and created over 5 million direct jobs. While progress is real, bureaucracy and supply chains still need tightening for India to fully break foreign dependencies and achieve long-term industrial independence.

**As seen, in case of any future wars, India needs to have a resilient manufacturing system - and USA, China etc might not be as helpful to India because they fear us.**

Hence, India should actively engage with higher probability countries and get things done. Those countries will be hesitant because of the bureaucratic red tapes and risk of inadvertent issues like strikes, state govt refusal etc. Govt should handle these beforehand.

**Govt. should try and fix these**

# 1. Regulatory + Bureaucratic Paralysis

**Problem:** Land, labor, tax, and pollution clearances are delayed by red tape and department turf wars. Even state-level political games can kill centrally approved projects.

**Solutions:**

* **National Digital Clearance Grid (Single Window with SLA + Auto-Fines)**
   * All industrial projects must pass through a single portal with max 60-day SLA (auto-approved if crossed).
   * **₹50,000/day penalty on each department** that exceeds SLA. Public delay log auto-published monthly.
* **Civil Accountability Law for Officers Causing Delays**
   * Bureaucrats who delay clearances without documented cause:
      * **₹1 lakh fine**, withheld promotion for 12 months.
      * Escalation reports reviewed every quarter by an **independent tribunal**.

# 2. Skill Mismatch and Labor Readiness

**Problem:** Indian labor lacks industrial discipline and high-precision training for semiconductors, robotics, or aerospace.

**Solutions:**

* **Industrial Co-Training Institutes with Global OEMs**
   * Partner with Siemens, Bosch, FANUC etc. to open 50+ co-run academies with 6-month in-plant apprenticeships.
   * Goal: Train 50,000 certified high-skill workers/year by 2028.
* **Merit-Based Public Funding for Training Institutes**
   * ₹1,000 crore/year disbursed only to ITIs and colleges placing ≥80% students in core industrial roles.
   * Institutes ranked quarterly; bottom 30% get funding cut by 50%.

# 3. Logistics and Infrastructure Bottlenecks

**Problem:** Poor roads, unstable electricity, and customs delays cripple precision industry timelines.

**Solutions:**

* **Digitized Port &amp; Customs SLA System (Max 72 hrs)**
   * All industrial import/export clearances must go through a real-time online tracker with **72-hour SLA**.
   * Departments violating SLA fined ₹50,000/day. Escalated to ministry after 5 days.
* **ISO-Compliant Industrial Corridors with Infra SLAs**
   * Grade-A infrastructure with 100% power uptime (dual grid + on-site backup), last-mile road access, and dry port within 10 km.
   * Run by **private Japanese/Korean infra firms** under 10-year maintenance contracts with quarterly audits.

# 4. Lack of Industrial Ecosystem

**Problem:** No local supply chains or precision tooling support for imported tech ecosystems.

**Solutions:**

* **₹5,000 Cr Industrial Vendor Boost Fund**
   * 50% capital subsidy for labs, cleanrooms, CNC/tool units, and material testing setups near MNC clusters.
   * Target: 1,000 domestic vendor units certified in 5 years.
* **30% Localization Mandate with Exit Buyback Clause**
   * MNCs must localize 30% sourcing in 5 years or pay 10% industrial cess.
   * If they exit early, India has **right to buy physical assets at 50% depreciated cost**.

# 5. Political Risk and Flip-Flop Policy

**Problem:** Policies get reversed after elections, killing investor trust.

**Solutions:**

* **10-Year Investment Protection Law for Strategic Tech**
   * Guarantees on **tax rates, import policy, and subsidies** for a decade. Must be approved by Parliament, not just ministries.
   * Covers firms in semiconductors, defense electronics, robotics, energy storage, etc.
* **State-Level Breach Penalty Clause**
   * If a state cancels a Centre-approved project, it must compensate 100% of sunk cost.
   * All contracts go through a **Centre-State Investment Tribunal** with 6-month decision deadline.

609,1imyi2y,"Writing check/help for a 'Labor first, LNP last' election campaign for the Chinese community",youngfool999,/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1imyi2y/writing_checkhelp_for_a_labor_first_lnp_last/,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1imyi2y/writing_checkhelp_for_a_labor_first_lnp_last/,25,12,1739280339.0,"Hi everyone, I am writing an article titled 'Labor first, LNP last' to distribute on the Chinese online social platforms to raise awareness amongst the Chinese ethnic voters that LNP is not our friend.

（I'm considering the Chinese title to be 'Labor number 1, LNP number 6', because the word last doesnt really rhyme with first in Chinese. I'm hoping 'LNP number 6' might draw some attraction, been an odd thing to say)

This was inspired by another post where someone shared a Facebook post with really informative content:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1ijnz86/i\_just\_found\_this\_comment\_on\_facebook\_im\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/friendlyjordies/comments/1ijnz86/i_just_found_this_comment_on_facebook_im_not/)

I have incorporated most of that post into this writing with some minor additions, so full credit to them. I have quoted the passage used from the above post, so if you have read that post, you can skip most of the quoted passages here.

There are several key topics which I believe will resonate with the Chinese community: wage stagnation and inflation, housing, tax breaks, immigration, and some touch on crime. While DEI is often seen as a none-issue for the Chinese community but I want to challenge that perception. I believe Niemoller's reflection, ""first, they came for..."" is the perfect opening punch for this article.

Some parts have been translated from Chinese to English, so they might not flow prefectly.

Even after few trims the writing is still quite lengthy (too much to write about!) so many thanks in advance for your time for reading it and I welcome any feedback and comments.

I encourage everyone to share this, whether on a similar social platform for your ethnicity group or simply with your friends and social circle. You have my full permission and blessing etc etc.

**Labor first, LNP last**

In 1946, German pastor Martin Niemöller reflected on the German society and his silence during the rise of the Nazis:

*""First, they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Communist.*

*Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.""*

**The LNP: A party for the wealthy, at war with the rest**

Peter Dutton, the leader of Australia’s opposition (Liberal-National Party, LNP), has openly praised U.S. President Donald Trump, calling him a “big-picture dealmaker.” Meanwhile, Dutton has lead the LNP to launch its attack on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies at home, dismissing DEI policies in the Australian public service as roles do nothing to improve the lives of everyday Australians.

Dutton’s attack on DEI is more than just a conservative talking point. It is a calculated strategy to dismantle hard-won protections for minorities, workers, and disadvantaged Australians. DEI programs aim to ensure fair access to opportunities for everyone. Dutton, closely following Trump’s rhetoric, has branded DEI as divisive and unnecessary.

You may think that LGBTQ+ rights, Indigenous welfare, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), trade unions, affirmative action, or women’s rights do not directly affect you. However, by tolerating or supporting oppression against these groups, you enable a broader erosion of social justice, one that ultimately affects everyone.

As Niemöller warned, injustice left unchecked expands until no one is safe. Every attack on our society’s most vulnerable is a future assault against the next. This is the vicious cycle we are witnessing in the United States, and history has proven time and again that allowing injustice to persist only enables its expansion—until eventually, no one is safe.

The LNP is not our friend.

**LNP: champions of the ultra rich**

&gt;As the next election approaches, expect to hear Coalition politicians and the Murdoch media blaming the “cost of living crisis,” “struggling families,” and the “housing crisis” on the Labor government. These are indeed issues of great concern, but we should take a closer look at how we got here.

&gt;Since 1996, Australia has spent 20 years under Coalition governments. In that same period, Labor has governed for just 9 years—only 3 of which were in a minority government. This means the Coalition has had more than twice the time to shape and influence the Australia we live in today.

&gt;When Labor took office in 2007, the Global Financial Crisis shook the world and devastated economies worldwide. Treasurer Wayne Swan was recognized by The Economist as the ""World’s Best Treasurer"" for steering Australia through the crisis.

&gt;What ultimately led to the downfall of that government was its attempt to introduce a Resource Super Profits Tax (Mining Tax), aimed at ensuring that Australians shared in the wealth generated by the mining boom. (For more on this, read: ""Norway shows how Australia can get a fair return from oil and gas."")

&gt;In 2010, the mining industry spent $28 million on a media campaign attacking the Labor government until Labor was forced to remove Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister. Labor was then pressured into a compromise with the mining industry, resulting in a watered-down version of the tax.

&gt;When Tony Abbott became Prime Minister in 2013, he completely abolished the mining tax.

&gt;Rudd’s original tax plan was estimated to generate $12 billion per year—funds that could have been invested in government services, hospitals, schools, and local industries.

&gt;So, where did that wealth go?  
(to name a few )

* Gina Rinehart is now worth over $30 billion.
* Andrew Forrest has over $20 billion.
* Clive Palmer has over $4 billion.

&gt;Other billionaires you've probably never heard of—Kie Chi Wong, Sam Chong, Chris Wallin, Angela Bennett, Alexandra Burt, and Chris Ellison—have all made their fortunes from Australia's mining industry.

Meanwhile,

* BHP's annual profit is just under $20 billion,
* Rio Tinto’s is around $18 billion, and
* Fortescue’s is close to $15 billion.

&gt;And what about ordinary Australians?

&gt;Wages have stagnated, the cost of living has soared, and resource wealth that should have benefited all Australians has instead been funneled into the hands of a small group of already ultra-rich individuals—thanks to the Coalition’s policies. This is not economic prosperity; this is wealth extraction from the many to benefit the few.

Some more LNP mess that should infuriate the timidest:

* In the 1980s and 1990s, under Labor, Australia was a world leader in solar and renewable energy. From the 1990s to 2010s, the Coalition prioritized mining and LNG exports, causing a mass exodus of talent and innovation in renewable sector.
* Labor introduced Australia’s National Broadband Network (NBN), which was mostly gutted by Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government in 2013. Under Turnbull, the LNP instead wasting billions of taxpayer dollars ‘upgrading’ Australia’s network with outdated technologies and setting back Australia’s internet infrastructure for decades.

**Housing for the Rich, Struggles for the Rest: The LNP’s Legacy**

&gt;In 1999, Coalition leader John Howard introduced a capital gains tax discount on investment properties, leading to a 400% increase in house prices, while average wages only grew by about 120% in the same period.

&gt;In the 2019 election, Labor proposed reforms to make housing more affordable by reducing tax breaks for property investors, and investing in affordable housing. The Coalition and their wealthy backers used all their fear-mongering tactics and Shorten lost the election.

&gt;The result? House prices doubled in major cities, and Australia’s housing crisis worsened.

&gt;This election loss allowed Scott Morrison's Coalition government to govern for another three years—perhaps one of the most scandal-plagued and corrupt administrations in Australian history. Morrison’s biggest policy achievement? Tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest 5% of Australians.

&gt;Three years ago, when Anthony Albanese and Labor came to power, they inherited a global inflation crisis. China, our largest trading partner, had imposed tariffs and trade bans on Australian exports due to Morrison’s foreign policy blunders.

&gt;Albanese reversed Morrison’s tax cuts to provide greater relief to low-income earners. Inflation has since returned to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) preferred range—half of what it was under Morrison. Additionally, through careful diplomacy, all trade restrictions on Australian products have now been lifted by the Chinese government.

&gt;Yes, housing is still an issue they have to fix. But this is not a mess they created, and there is no easy solution.

&gt;I'm not going to sell you that Labor are the answer to all of Australia's problems right now, but if you look back over the past 30 years it's pretty clear that most of our problems started with a Coalition Prime Minister.

&gt;Whatever problems we are facing, Peter Dutton's Coalition and their ultra wealthy backers like Gina Rinehart and Rupert Murdoch are only going to make it worse.

**The Coalition’s Immigration Hypocrisy: Profits Over People**

The Coalition brands itself as a ""tough on immigration"", often claiming that migration hurts jobs, infrastructure, and housing. However, ABS data shows that Australia's immigration takes were the same or even higher under LNP leadership.

Why?

Because big businesses thrive on our immigration policy to supply them with cheap labour.

The Murdoch media and LNP pushes the narrative that ""foreigners are coming to take our jobs"" and slams Labor for opening our doors. But we are now in the realisation that the LNP and their corporate friends welcomes migrants with opening arms despite blaming migrates for our every woe.

Big businesses use immigration to pushdown labour costs, forcing the general workforce to accept low wages and poor working conditions. The LNP and Murdoch media's consistent attack on unions is in unison of this malpractice.

This is a bigger corporate scheme to weakens the bargaining power of local workforce to maximum profit, with the broader effect of social stratification and LNP is their tool for the job.

(Perhaps I'm giving more credits to LNP then they deserve, because this is really a neoliberalism disaster. However, neoliberalism is the policy which LNP subscribes to)

**The Coalition’s Tax Scam: The prefect crime**

The Coalition frequently promotes tax cuts and attack the Labor for 'wasting' money on public spending. Every time the LNP talks about “tax cuts,” remember who benefits most.

For every dollar in tax cuts given to ordinary Australians, the Coalition ensures that their corporate friends receive thousands of times more.

The real losers are not just the low-income and middle-class Australians, but everyone Australian who are not a member of the ultra-wealthy.

Tax cuts mean less government funding for public services, leading to failing public infrastructure, underfunded public healthcare, and declining education quality.

The result? Greater inequality, financial hardship and crime.

We know that poverty and inequality fuels crime. When support systems are dismantled, more people fall into financial hardship, making crime a last resort for survival.

Reducing corporate taxes benefits the wealthiest while neglecting the needs of ordinary citizens. As social safety nets are eroded, rising crime and instability impact everyone.

The Coalition’s tax policies have steadily pushed for wealth inequality, weakened social infrastructure, and as a byproduct, fueled crime, all while enriching corporations and billionaires.

**Conclusion: The Coalition is Not Your Friend**

For decades, the LNP has prioritised billionaires and big corporations over workers, minorities, and the vulnerable.

If you’re concerned or angry (like me) about rising costs, unaffordable housing, wage stagnation, or failing public services, don’t let the Coalition convince you that Labor is to blame.

It’s time to stop falling for their distractions and fear campaigns. The real enemy is an economic system rigged in favour of the wealthy – a system that the Coalition has spent decades protecting.

**Labor first, LNP last.**

I still reply and I’m still happy to answer questions.

Hey! Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on this subreddit. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear)

I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. 

No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. 

There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. 

Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours)

Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. 
There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere.

Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, Agnico Eagle Mines, AngloGold Ashanti, Gerald Group, Petrobras, Shell, starting their own firms, etc.

Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. 

Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest, as well as oil and gas trading), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. 

Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD
PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. 

Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. 

There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. 

The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

Please reach out if you have any comments! ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.679102,2024-12-05T17:03:27,Rio Tinto,2024

Flavia Tata Nardini always wanted to be an astronaut. Now her space-tech firm is on its way to joining the ranks of unicorns, but she almost ran out of cash, twice.

By Yolanda Redrup

8 min. readView original

When Flavia Tata Nardini was a little girl living on a mountain outside Rome, she loved the night of San Lorenzo in the middle of summer. Italian legend says the shower of shooting stars that appears around August 10 evokes the fires that martyred St Lawrence. In reality, they come from the annual meteor shower created by the orbit of the Swift-Tuttle comet.

“I was a space geek,” says Nardini. “It was the most beautiful thing, and it completely inspired me.”

“I always wanted to be an astronaut, I just wanted to go to the stars,” she says.

Today, Nardini is a rocket scientist and the co-founder of an $800 million company, [Fleet Space Technologies](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/management/this-moonshot-tech-firm-is-australia-s-fastest-growing-company-20231113-p5ejhe), which makes and sends shoebox-sized satellites into space and uses artificial intelligence technology to find critical mineral deposits.

Nardini was the fourth of five children. Her mother taught English and French and her father was an architect and entrepreneur. Her parents divorced when she was 10, and her father had money troubles.

Finding school “a little bit easy”, the teenage Nardini played basketball professionally, completed two degrees in aerospace engineering and got her first job as a rocket scientist at the European Space Agency. After a year, she joined the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.

“It was fun working with all these incredible missions – putting satellites on the moon, building propulsion systems for big launches, and this is where I understood that this passion for me was real,” Nardini says.

“I was leading multibillion-dollar projects to go to Mars with satellites.”

When she was 28, Nardini gave up her job for an Australian guy she had met in the Netherlands and relocated to Adelaide. She has two daughters, 12 and 9. Taking care of a baby, she says, with a chuckle, is harder than rocket science.

At the time, Nardini was not worried about her career. She knew South Australia was a hub for defence tech and that the country was “techie”, but she soon discovered the city of churches was nothing like the bustling space tech community she had grown accustomed to in Europe.

“I had this idea of building a rocket concept and most universities did not even understand what I was proposing,” Nardini says.

“The only example of entrepreneurship I had was my dad. Entrepreneurship for me was not something connected to success, but was connected … to a lot of suffering.”

She did not want to be an entrepreneur; she wanted to find a job, but when no jobs existed, Nardini was thrust into being a founder.

**Her first company was not a runaway success**. Called LaunchBox, it taught school kids how to make small 3D-printed satellites, which they launched into space on weather balloons. She founded it with Matt Pearson, who she met at the University of Adelaide, Brian Lim and Inovar Technologies founder Matthew Tetlow.

In 2015, Nardini, Pearson and Tetlow started Fleet. Within 20 minutes of Nardini having the idea for Fleet, Pearson had decided on the company name and bought the domain name. By the end of the day, he had also designed the logo, which the company still uses today.

They raised about $50,000 to fund the business. Pearson put in $25,000 of his own money and the government contributed $25,000 via a grant.

“We were very passionate about the small satellites revolution,” she says. “We started doing what we knew how to do – building satellites, buying licences and doing the minimum.”

A year in, they were approached by one of the country’s largest venture capital funds, Blackbird Ventures. Nardini had never heard of the fund and did not know anything about venture capital, but a month later [Blackbird’s co-founder Niki Scevak](https://www.afr.com/technology/why-blackbird-s-scevak-thinks-he-is-more-buffett-than-vc-20230215-p5cks4) emailed saying the fund would like to invest.

“My first memory of Flavia a decade ago was of her magical ability to bring people together,” Scevak says. “Fleet started with no capital, but Flavia was able to get a satellite launched by running a program for school kids, partnering with a university satellite launch for free, and then including the first alpha version of Fleet on top.

Blackbird ended up leading a $5 million round, which also had participation from Mike Cannon-Brookes’ Grok.

“I sometimes look at the pitch deck we gave to Blackbird for that first round, and it was so good,” Nardini says. “It feels so energetic and powerful and inspiring. Sometimes Matt and I look at it and smile.”

In that deck, they included their aspiration to explore not just the Earth, but also the moon and Mars. Next year, this goal will become a reality when its seismic technology lands on the moon’s surface aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost lunar lander in its second lunar mission.

**The fledgling space-tech company faced its first existential test in 2019**. The company had booked to launch satellites into orbit, including with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, but SpaceX was running six months behind schedule and Fleet’s money was running out.

Nardini called fellow entrepreneur Peter Beck, the New Zealand-based chief executive of Rocket Lab. He was gearing up for his first orbital rocket launch and Nardini told him if Fleet didn’t get its satellites into orbit soon, Fleet was “dead”.

Beck agreed to help but needed the satellites in Auckland in two weeks. The problem was that Fleet’s satellites were thousands of kilometres away with SpaceX in America. Pearson and Nardini raced to build two new satellites by hand using leftover spare parts.

“I remember Peter asking me how much we could pay. Satellites like these are expensive – one kilogram in space costs $50,000 – and I said ‘we have nothing’,” Nardini says.

“He said, ‘Okay, $1.’ That was the moment which Peter made me. We became friends, and I’ve launched many satellites with him after because he saved Fleet.

“Entrepreneurs helping entrepreneurs is the most wonderful thing”.

The launch succeeded, and the pair kicked off a two-week roadshow in 2019, trying to raise its “Series A”, its first significant round of capital, from investors in the US, Hong Kong and Australia.

Investors were slow to commit, and Fleet was again cash-strapped. Nardini was counting on Hong Kong’s Horizons Ventures, which was busy in the middle of the Zoom float.

“I had a one-year-old and a three-year-old and I remember crying in the car,” Nardini says. “My three-year-old asked me why I was crying, and I said it was because I wasn’t sure if I could raise the Series A … and she said to me, ‘Why don’t you park the car and send them a message?’

“I did, I said, ‘I just want to let you know that we really need to close this, and we really need you guys to sign.’”

That worked. Fleet banked $US7.4 million, led by Momenta Ventures and Grok, with contributions from Horizons Ventures, Blackbird and the South Australian government.

**Fleet’s first big customer was Rio Tinto**. Its first big product was CSB ExoSphere, which uses nano-satellites, ground sensors and artificial intelligence to create 3D subsurface models for mineral exploration. The first contract was worth $250,000.

“We had mass manufacturing, clients all over the world, and it all happened so fast after CSB,” Nardini says.

“Artificial intelligence in this space is very complex. It’s very niche. It means you can find deposits without having to do 30,000 drill holes, you only need a handful.

“It means you can find all the copper, without having the huge environmental impact.”

Fleet’s first financial report las year revealed $26.8 million in sales, up from $9.2 million the year before, and over 75 per cent was from ExoSphere.

Australia is the largest market for deployments, followed by Canada and South Asia. It also has a growing presence in Saudi Arabia, including a four-year contract with Saudi miner Maaden.

The same year, Fleet raised $150 million in a Series D round, valuing the company at $800 million – on its way to joining the ranks of unicorns, start-ups worth over $1 billion.

This year, Fleet bought HiSeis, a provider of seismic exploration technology, won a $1.6 million grant to teach secondary school students about satellite technology, and opened a global headquarters and factory at Adelaide Airport, enabling it to produce hundreds of satellites per year.

A decision that helped accelerate Fleet’s growth, Nardini says, was narrowing the focus of the business further after each capital raise.

It’s counterintuitive – more money often means opportunities to expand the breadth of the business – but Nardini knew she needed to hone in on Fleet’s core value proposition.

After its Series A, Fleet focused on customers attached to the energy transition. After Series B, it went all in on resources and critical minerals, and after its $50 million Series C in 2023, it decided to focus on copper players.

“My rule as an entrepreneur is as you grow, you focus. When you focus, that’s when the magic happens,” she says.

**It hasn’t been an easy ride.** Nardini’s marriage broke up, her mother died, and after a difficult third pregnancy she spent seven months in a wheelchair.

“I can’t tell you how I managed to survive that,” she reflects. “It was really, really hard.”

The former couple remain friends and Nardini found love again, marrying her co-founder Pearson last June.

“I wouldn’t do it any other way. I’m a pretty relaxed person, I sleep so much, I take care of myself, I have a good sense of humour – otherwise I wouldn’t have made it,” Nardini says.

“The kids are my life, I spend so much time with them. They are part of everything – they spend time at Fleet, they know space better than anyone else.”

They also know all about big money deals. As toddlers, her daughters started acting out $4 million transactions with their dolls.

Personal expansion is also critical. Every quarter she expects herself to “level up 10 times”. But it’s humour and realism that keep her grounded.

“I don’t take things personally, and Fleet is not my baby. It’s an honour to serve Fleet … but I’m not attached to it in a way that I cannot think or take things personally,” she says.

It means she also has dreams outside of Fleet. During the pandemic, Nardini applied to the European Space Agency to become an astronaut with [her friend, Katherine Bennell-Pegg](https://www.afr.com/life-and-luxury/fashion-and-style/one-in-80-million-australia-s-first-astronaut-awaits-her-moonshot-20250210-p5lb0n). She was one of several hundred selected to take the recruitment tests in Germany but was ultimately not chosen, unlike Bennell-Pegg, who is now eligible for selection on missions.

Her hope to one day go to space is not dead, however – she may just have to fly herself there one day.

Nardini’s biggest hope is that Fleet outlives her. “It is a 100-year journey. My plan for Fleet is that we become the best explorers of this planet, and others,” she says.

“I want it to become one of the biggest tech companies in the world. This is my contribution to humanity.”",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.679187,2025-07-02T07:16:20,Rio Tinto,2025

How Canada’s Mineral Wealth Could Power Europe’s Defense Boom

https://preview.redd.it/0geklyd2rc3f1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcd69116cd4de9c8114ade2c9ae1f11155fda132

Canada’s military and economic playbook just got a serious upgrade. Today, King Charles III, in a rare throne speech appearance in Ottawa, announced Canada’s entry into the European Union’s ReArm Europe plan—now suavely rebranded as Readiness 2030 after some diplomatic side-eye from Italy and Spain \[\]. This move, aimed at boosting Europe’s military production and reducing reliance on U.S. arms, isn’t just about tanks and jets—it’s a golden opportunity for Canada’s critical minerals sector to shine. With a wink to geopolitics and a nod to economic savvy, Canada’s poised to cash in on Europe’s hunger for lithium, cobalt, and rare earths. Let’s unpack how this transatlantic handshake could reshape the critical minerals market, with all the facts and a dash of wit.

**What’s the ReArm Europe Plan, Anyway?**

The ReArm Europe plan, or Readiness 2030, is the EU’s ambitious €800 billion push to supercharge its defense industry, diversify supply chains, and flex some strategic muscle amid global tensions \[\]. Think of it as Europe’s answer to a world where U.S. reliability is wobbling (thanks, Trump) and China’s grip on critical minerals feels like a geopolitical chokehold \[\]. The plan, backed by the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), targets 10% domestic mineral extraction, 40% EU processing, and 25% recycling by 2030 \[\]. It’s a tall order, and Canada, with its treasure trove of critical minerals, is stepping up to be Europe’s new best friend \[\].

**Canada’s Critical Minerals: The EU’s New Crush**

Canada’s no stranger to the critical minerals game. With vast reserves of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs), it’s like the cool kid with the best snacks at the global resource party \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan is set to crank up demand for these minerals, which are the backbone of defense tech—think batteries for drones, magnets for missiles, and electronics for fighter jets. Canada’s already a top supplier of 13 of the U.S.’s 35 critical minerals, including uranium and indium, and it’s eyeing a similar role for Europe \[\].

The EU’s desperate to loosen China’s 98% stranglehold on heavy REEs and other minerals like graphite \[\]. Enter Canada, with its stable politics and ESG-friendly mining cred. The 2021 Canada-EU Strategic Partnership on Raw Materials is already bearing fruit, with seven joint projects in battery production and lithium processing \[\]. Canada’s participation in ReArm Europe could turbocharge these efforts, funneling minerals like nickel and cobalt into European defense supply chains \[\]. Expect Canadian mining stocks to get a patriotic glow-up as EU contracts roll in.

**Economic Upside: Jobs, Investment, and a Little Swagger**

This isn’t just about rocks—it’s about jobs and economic swagger. Canada’s Critical Minerals Strategy, launched in 2022, has poured over $700 million into mining, processing, and recycling, with another $500 million from the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF) up for grabs in 2025 \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan could amplify this, drawing European investment into Canadian mines and processing facilities. Imagine French or German firms cozying up with Canadian SMEs to refine lithium or recycle REEs—cha-ching! \[\]

Indigenous communities stand to gain, too. Canada’s strategy emphasizes economic reconciliation, with initiatives like the National Benefits Sharing Framework ensuring First Nations and Métis reap direct rewards from mining projects \[\]. The EU’s strict sustainability standards align with Canada’s push for responsible sourcing, potentially boosting Indigenous-led projects \[\]. It’s a win-win, assuming Canada can navigate the regulatory maze without tripping over its own red tape \[\].

**Challenges: Not All Glitter Is Gold**

Of course, it’s not all maple syrup and rosy projections. Scaling up mining to meet EU demand means faster permitting—Canada’s eyeing the EU’s 27-month mining permit timeline as a model \[\]. But environmental pushback, like the protests over Portugal’s Barroso lithium mine, could haunt Canadian projects if not handled deftly \[\]. Competition from Australia and African nations, also cozying up to the EU, might keep mineral prices in check, squeezing Canadian margins \[\]. And let’s not forget China’s market muscle—its recent export bans on gallium and germanium sent prices soaring, a reminder of its power to rattle global supply chains \[\].

**Geopolitical Chess: Canada’s Checkmate?**

Geopolitically, this is Canada playing 4D chess. With Trump’s NATO skepticism and Russia’s war in Ukraine shaking up alliances, Canada’s pivot to Europe is a strategic hedge \[\]. The ReArm Europe plan, coupled with Canada’s G7 presidency in 2025, gives Ottawa a megaphone to push for diversified, secure supply chains \[\]. By aligning with the EU, Canada could reduce its own reliance on U.S. markets while positioning itself as a global critical minerals powerhouse \[\]. Checkmate, skeptics.

**What’s Next for Canada’s Mineral Boom?**

The ReArm Europe plan is a game-changer for Canada’s critical minerals sector. Expect a surge in demand for lithium, cobalt, and REEs, with Canadian firms like Neo Performance Materials and Rio Tinto’s Sorel-Tracy scandium plant ready to deliver \[\]. But success hinges on streamlining regulations, securing EU partnerships, and keeping ESG promises. If Canada plays its cards right, it could not only fuel Europe’s defense ambitions but also cement its status as a critical minerals superpower.

So, is this a jackpot for Canada? With the right moves, it’s less a gamble and more a calculated bet on a mineral-rich future. Stay tuned—this transatlantic tango is just getting started.

# U.S. Consumer Confidence Soars to 98.0 in May, Beating Expectations Amid Trade Optimism

U.S. consumer confidence rebounded sharply in May, surging to 98.0 from 86.0 in April, significantly surpassing the forecast of 87.1.

The Conference Board's report showed improvements in both the present situation index (125.9) and expectations index (72.8), indicating a more positive outlook for the economy and labor market. The rebound comes after five consecutive months of decline, largely attributed to the 90-day tariff truce between the U.S. and China, which helped alleviate trade war fears.

U.S. consumer confidence rebounded sharply in May, surging to 98.0 from 86.0 in April, significantly surpassing the forecast of 87.1.

The Conference Board's report showed improvements in both the present situation index (125.9) and expectations index (72.8), indicating a more positive outlook for the economy and labor market. The rebound comes after five consecutive months of decline, largely attributed to the 90-day tariff truce between the U.S. and China, which helped alleviate trade war fears.

A Bold Bet on America’s Mineral Independence

https://preview.redd.it/zoesvrk2plwe1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935bc6bb282e16e76fc38849f7dc13304e3ed50d

Buckle up, America, because the Trump administration is hitting the gas on a mineral revolution that could make the U.S. a powerhouse in critical resources! On April 18, 2025, the White House announced a bold move to fast-track 10 mining projects, a seismic shift to secure domestic supplies of copper, lithium, antimony, and more. This isn’t just a policy pivot—it’s a declaration of independence from foreign mineral overlords, particularly China, and a bullish bet on America’s economic and security future. With the stroke of an executive pen, President Trump’s Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production (March 20, 2025) has set the stage for a new era of self-reliance. Let’s dig into the dirt and unearth why this is the spark America’s been waiting for.

**A Mineral Wake-Up Call**

Picture this: the U.S., the world’s economic juggernaut, is 100% reliant on China for antimony, a mineral critical for everything from missile systems to advanced communications. Rare earths? We’re importing 70% from the same source. Copper, lithium, potash—the list of vulnerabilities reads like a geopolitical horror story ([The New York Times, April 16, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/climate/rare-earths-critical-minerals-china-united-states.html)). China’s recent export bans, like the one on six rare earths, have sounded the alarm louder than a foghorn at a library ([Reuters, April 15, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-signs-order-launching-probe-into-reliance-imported-critical-minerals-2025-04-15/)). The solution? A homegrown mineral boom, and Trump’s fast-track initiative is the dynamite to blast through bureaucratic red tape.

These 10 projects, granted VIP status under the FAST-41 program—a 2015 federal gem that streamlines permitting without gutting environmental safeguards—are America’s ticket to mineral sovereignty. From Arizona’s copper caches to Idaho’s antimony treasure trove, this lineup is a strategic masterstroke to fuel defense, green energy, and infrastructure ([The White House, April 18, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/)). And the best part? The Federal Permitting Dashboard ensures every step is transparent, letting the public keep tabs like a hawk on a field mouse ([Permitting Council](https://www.permitting.gov/projects/title-41-fixing-americas-surface-transportation-act-fast-41)).

**The Fab Ten: America’s Mineral All-Stars**

Here’s the roster of the 10 projects poised to rewrite America’s mineral story, complete with their operators, minerals, and stock tickers for the Wall Street warriors among us ([Reuters, April 18, 2025](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/trump-fast-track-permitting-10-mining-projects-across-us-2025-04-18/), [MINING.COM, April 18, 2025](https://www.mining.com/web/trump-to-fast-track-permitting-for-10-mining-projects-across-us/)):

https://preview.redd.it/5tk86zk7plwe1.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4583e292e3899cc0c10b427059b1105e06f4a902

These projects aren’t just holes in the ground—they’re the backbone of America’s future. Copper, the lifeblood of electrical grids and wind turbines, is in hot demand, with a single wind farm guzzling up to 15 million pounds ([Visual Capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/copper-driving-green-energy-revolution/)). Lithium, the darling of EV batteries, is set to power the clean energy revolution, while antimony could break China’s stranglehold on defense-critical supplies. Potash and phosphate? They’re the unsung heroes keeping America’s farms fertile and food security intact.

**Industry Titans Roar Approval**

The industry is buzzing like a beehive at a flower festival. Jon Cherry, CEO of Perpetua Resources, didn’t mince words: “Today’s Executive Order is a resounding endorsement of American mining, and the Stibnite Gold Project is a prime example of why critical mineral production in America requires immediate attention and prioritization” ([Perpetua Resources Press Release](https://www.investors.perpetuaresources.com/investors/news)). Stibnite alone could supply 35% of U.S. antimony demand in its first six years, a game-changer for national security.

David Park, Standard Lithium’s CEO, was equally pumped: “This special status not only accelerates development but also supports efforts to provide a cost-effective, sustainable domestic lithium supply, vital for tech innovations in energy” ([Finimize](https://finimize.com/content/standard-lithiums-us-project-gets-green-light-from-trumps-executive-order)). Other heavyweights like Rio Tinto, Albemarle, and Hecla Mining haven’t dropped specific quotes, but the industry’s collective cheer is louder than a jackhammer at dawn ([Mining Weekly, April 21, 2025](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/trump-administration-fast-tracks-10-mining-projects-in-critical-minerals-push-2025-04-22)).

**Why Domestic Supply Is Non-Negotiable**

Let’s get real: relying on foreign minerals is like letting your neighbor control your Wi-Fi password. China’s dominance—100% of U.S. antimony, 70% of rare earths—leaves America vulnerable to supply chain shocks ([The New York Times, April 16, 2025](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/climate/rare-earths-critical-minerals-china-united-states.html)). With global demand for copper projected to hit 36.6 million tonnes by 2031 and lithium consumption expected to triple by 2030, the U.S. can’t afford to sit on the sidelines ([DNV](https://www.dnv.com/article/the-role-of-copper-in-the-energy-transition-247342/)). These projects are a clarion call to action, promising jobs, innovation, and a shield against geopolitical curveballs.

Take Resolution Copper, one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper deposits, or McDermitt, a lithium behemoth poised to juice up America’s EV ambitions. Warrior Met Coal’s metallurgical coal will keep steel mills humming, while Michigan Potash ensures farmers aren’t at the mercy of global fertilizer markets. This isn’t just mining—it’s a strategic chess move to checkmate dependency.

**Navigating the Rough Terrain**

Sure, not everyone’s popping champagne. Resolution Copper has sparked pushback from Native American groups, a reminder that progress must tread carefully ([Bloomberg, April 19, 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-19/rio-tinto-bhp-s-resolution-copper-wins-fast-track-status-in-us)). But FAST-41 isn’t a regulatory bulldozer—it keeps environmental protections and public input intact, just with clearer timelines to avoid the 7–10-year permitting quagmires that make Australia’s 2–5 years look like a sprint ([U.S. Department of the Interior, April 17, 2025](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-adds-key-mining-projects-fast-41)).

**The Road Ahead: More to Come**

The White House isn’t stopping here. More projects will join the FAST-41 roster, a rolling thunder of mineral momentum ([The White House, April 18, 2025](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/trump-administration-advances-first-wave-of-critical-mineral-production-projects/)). Investors are already eyeing public players like Rio Tinto (RIO), Perpetua Resources (PPTA), and Albemarle (ALB), while private outfits like Lisbon Valley Mining and Michigan Potash keep things exclusive. The Federal Permitting Dashboard is your front-row seat to watch this saga unfold ([Permitting Dashboard](https://www.permits.performance.gov/)).

**The Bottom Line**

Trump’s fast-track gambit is a middle finger to foreign dependency and a love letter to American ingenuity. These 10 projects are more than mines—they’re the foundation of a self-reliant future, powering everything from tanks to Teslas. With industry titans cheering and the government clearing the path, the U.S. is poised to reclaim its mineral mojo. So, grab your hard hat, America—this is one dig that’s going to pay off big.

* Plan aims to counter China's control over critical minerals
* Fighter jets, submarines, bullets built with minerals processed by China
* ***Trump doesn't plan to establish critical minerals stockpile, sources say***

March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump aims to build metals refining facilities on Pentagon military bases as part of his plan to boost domestic production of critical minerals and offset China's control of the sector, two senior administration officials told Reuters. The move is one of several planned for an executive order Trump could sign as soon as Wednesday after he told [the U.S. Congress last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-address-congress-after-upending-us-foreign-domestic-policies-2025-03-04/) he would ""take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.""

As part of the order, the Pentagon would work with other federal agencies to install processing facilities on its bases, according to the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the administration's deliberations. Using military bases for processing would underscore the importance Trump is placing on critical minerals for national security. Fighter jets, submarines, bullets and other weaponry used by the U.S. military are built with minerals processed by Beijing. Trump also plans to name a critical minerals czar, similar to steps previous presidents have taken to coordinate Washington's focus on other areas, according to one of the sources. The plans are under discussion and could change before Trump signs the order, the sources added.

Some Trump administration officials were spooked by initial signs that China might [restrict critical minerals exports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/) as part of its retaliation for Trump's tariffs or for other reasons, according to a person familiar with their thinking.The U.S. National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. With the Pentagon controlling about 30 million acres of land, the plan would ensure there is available land for the refining facilities, avoiding the controversy that sometimes occurs in host local communities. It would also avoid the need to buy land and avoid using land controlled by other federal department.

# A plan that prioritizes metals processing - rather than an overhaul of U.S. mine permitting -could irk U.S. miners but address a longstanding concern from manufacturers that China controls too much of the global metals processing sector. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the U.S. Geological Survey, for example. It's not clear how Trump's plan for processing facilities on Pentagon bases could work from a regulatory perspective, as the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act would still apply to Pentagon bases and those regulations have hindered private development of processing projects in the past. Trump previously signaled a willingness for alternative uses of lands controlled by Washington. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to open up portions of federal land for [large-scale housing construction](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-2024-09-05/), with zones that would be ""ultra-low tax and ultra-low regulation.""

Trump does not plan in the order to establish a U.S. critical minerals stockpile that would mimic the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the sources said, a step that some in the administration and mining industry had sought. China stockpiles some critical minerals, including cobalt, and the U.S. government last year considered [stockpiling the metal](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/), which is used in missiles, aerospace parts, magnets for communication, and radar and guidance systems. Trump also does not plan to order the Pentagon or other U.S. agencies to require vendors to use only U.S. minerals, what is known as a ""Buy American"" mandate, and one that junior miners especially have said is needed to offset [China's market manipulations](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-miners-push-higher-metals-prices-ward-off-chinese-rivals-2024-07-22/). Nor would the order try to alter the federal mine permitting process, which was set by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, largely because such a move would require an act of Congress. However, it would aim to expand the FAST-41 permitting process for mines, building on a [step Trump took in his first term](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/trump-moves-loosen-mining-regulations-approve-projects-he-exits-2021-01-08/), according to the sources. South32's [(S32.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/S32.AX) Hermosa zinc-manganese project in Arizona was [fast-tracked](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trump-20-wont-reverse-bidens-critical-minerals-push-andy-home-2024-11-21/) by former President Joe Biden, the first mine to receive that treatment. The order would also seek to reclassify mine waste on federal land, mimicking a step that Rio Tinto [(RIO.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RIO.AX), Freeport-McMoRan [(FCX.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/FCX.N) and others have taken to tap [piles of old waste rock](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/miners-turn-bacteria-other-new-ways-leach-copper-waste-rock-2022-05-11/) at U.S. mines previously thought to be worthless.

It was not immediately clear if Trump plans to declare copper as a strategic mineral, which would allow U.S. miners of the widely used metal tap into a 10% production tax credit. Phoenix-based Freeport, the largest U.S. copper miner, told Reuters on Monday it hopes Trump takes that step, which would [save it $500 million annually](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ceraweek-freeport-sees-500-million-annual-boost-if-trump-declares-copper-2025-03-10/).

# MARCH 6th, 2025~The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals

[The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals – The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/the-geopolitics-of-critical-minerals/)

https://preview.redd.it/34e5isrrs1oe1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3837900f6d18552c2d3ecf0fcdabdb398222c222

Trans-Pacific View author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with Thijs Van de Graaf – associate professor at Ghent University, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, and lead author of IRENA’s report on the geopolitics of critical materials (2023) – is the 451st in The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series.

**Explain the role and relevance of critical minerals in the global energy transition.**

The energy transition is, at its core, a materials transition. Batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs) rely on lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements – making clean technologies far more mineral-intensive than fossil fuel systems. An electric car, for example, requires six times more minerals than a conventional one, and an offshore wind farm needs nine times more minerals per megawatt than a gas plant.

But unlike fossil fuels, which must be constantly extracted and burned, minerals are a one-time input. Once mined, they can be used, reused, and recycled – shifting the security equation. The problem is not that we lack these materials, but that supply chains are fragile, refining is concentrated, and demand is rising faster than production can keep up.

**Examine the impact of China-U.S. geopolitical tensions on critical minerals supply chains.**

The China-U.S. rivalry is reshaping global supply chains for critical minerals. China dominates many aspects of the critical minerals supply chain, but it particularly controls refining and processing. While China only mines about 13 percent of global lithium resources, it refines over 60 percent of the world’s lithium. Similarly, it processes 85 percent of the world’s rare earths​. This dominance is not so much linked to resource endowment, but rather strategic industrial policy and capital investment over decades​.

In response, the U.S. is racing to reshape supply chains, incentivize domestic production, and deepen partnerships with resource-rich allies like Australia and Canada. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has kickstarted major investment, while China has retaliated with export controls on gallium and germanium – signaling that critical minerals are now a geopolitical bargaining chip.

The result is a fragmenting supply chain, with competing industrial blocs forming. But reshoring and diversification take time, and in the short term, bottlenecks, price volatility, and political risk will define the landscape.

**What other geopolitical risks are affecting developments in the critical minerals industry?**

Beyond China-U.S. tensions, mineral supply chains are becoming a new arena for geopolitical power struggles. I see three geopolitical risks.

Resource nationalism is surging. Indonesia has banned unprocessed nickel exports to build a domestic processing industry. Chile and Mexico are nationalizing lithium reserves, aiming to move up the value chain – from mining to battery production. The message is clear: mineral-rich countries no longer want to be just suppliers; they want a bigger cut of the profits.

Territorial disputes over mineral wealth are heating up. The Trump administration floated the idea of buying Greenland – rich in rare earths – and recently has begun insisting that Ukraine’s mineral deposits play a role in repaying U.S. military aid. In Africa, Rwanda-backed rebels are seizing key mining regions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Industrial policy is taking center stage. Governments are investing in battery recycling, alternative chemistries, and supply chain resilience. Sodium-ion and solid-state batteries could eventually reduce reliance on lithium and cobalt. But geopolitical urgency is pushing softer issues – like environmental impact and labor rights – off the agenda.

**Analyze the correlation between energy security and national security from the perspectives of Washington, Beijing, and other stakeholder countries.**

Energy security is no longer just about oil and gas. It’s about who controls the materials that power the clean energy economy.

For Washington, reliance on Chinese mineral refining is seen as a strategic vulnerability. The U.S. is doubling down on supply chain resilience through government intervention, incentives, and defense-linked investments.

For Beijing, mineral dominance is a lever of geopolitical influence. China has spent decades securing supply chains, investing in African mines, Latin American lithium, and strategic stockpiles. But China is also vulnerable – it is the world’s largest importer of raw nickel, copper, and lithium, meaning any disruption in its upstream supply could reverberate through its economy.

For Europe, Japan, and emerging economies, the challenge is navigating growing economic nationalism. The EU has launched its Critical Raw Materials Act to boost domestic refining, but with limited resources, it remains dependent on imports. Meanwhile, resource-rich countries like Indonesia and Chile are seizing the moment to extract better deals from global buyers.

The world is entering an era where access to minerals is as strategic as access to oil once was – but with a key difference: a lithium shortage won’t shut down your EV, but it might prevent new ones from being built. The security risks are real, but they play out over a different time horizon.

**Assess the market implications of China-U.S. strategic competition regarding China’s control over critical minerals.**

The China-U.S. competition over critical minerals is reshaping global markets, not just in trade but in industrial power. China dominates refining and processing, not because it has all the resources, but because it built the infrastructure. The West is now racing to catch up, but mining and refining take time, creating fragmentation, price volatility, and geopolitical leverage.

Yet true self-sufficiency is an illusion – China is also the largest importer of key raw materials. Supply chains are not linear but deeply interwoven. The real challenge is not just securing more minerals but rethinking supply itself: investing in recycling, new battery chemistries, and urban mining to break dependencies and build resilience.

Rather than a return to free-market dynamics, we are entering an era where industrial policy and geopolitical strategy dictate the future of critical minerals markets. Governments will continue to heavily intervene in supply chains, whether through subsidies, trade restrictions, or strategic partnerships.

# Ottawa unveils investments to bolster nation's energy security and reduce its reliance on authoritarian governments.

As trade disputes with the United States escalate and the demand for critical minerals continues to rise, the Canadian government steps up its efforts to leverage the nation's critical minerals advantage.

During a March 3 presentation at the 2025 Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto, Canada's Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson unveiled more than C$600 million ($415 million) in new funding and tax credits aimed to accelerate mining and enable the development and expansion of critical minerals in Canada.

""The investments and initiatives announced today will create good jobs for Canadian workers and businesses, support economic opportunities, bolster its energy security, reduce our reliance on authoritarian governments and contribute to a resilient and secure future,"" Wilkinson said.

This federal funding package includes two primary components: a tax credit to boost domestic mineral exploration investments and a C$500 million ($346 million) commitment to infrastructure in Canada's richest critical mineral regions.

""By investing big in critical minerals research and infrastructure development, we are not only accelerating our transition to a low-carbon economy but also securing generational economic opportunities for Canadians to take the lead in the global shift to net zero,"" said Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne.

[Canada's critical minerals list was assembled from the viewpoint of a mining powerhouse positioning itself as the global supplier of choice for the minerals and metals essential to modern living.](https://preview.redd.it/5y2oa171r1oe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dad0031b7c5c87ce91205a82c4cdea072f3665f)

# Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

Canada's Mineral Exploration Tax Credit encourages Canadians to invest in Canada-based companies to explore for minerals and metals on Canadian soil.

Because junior mining companies typically do not turn a profit until they sell their mineral exploration projects or advance them into production, the money invested in exploration is considered a loss on financial balance sheets. The Canadian government developed a way to turn this loss into a financial gain for Canadian investors.

Canada's Income Tax Act allows Canadian companies to transfer mineral exploration expenses to individual investors through flow-through shares. For tax purposes, the mineral exploration expenses are considered to have been incurred by the investor, not the company, and can reduce the investor's taxable income.

Under the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, individual investors can claim a 15% tax credit for eligible mineral exploration expenses. Only Canadian companies can participate in flow-through financings, and all the investments that flow tax credits to Canadian investors have to be spent on projects in Canada.

There had been some concern that the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit would expire on its sunset date at the end of March. However, Wilkinson announced that the program will be extended for two years.

This extension is expected to generate C$110 million ($76 million) in new mineral exploration investments across Canada.

""With this proposed extension to the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we continue to foster the sustainable development of Canada's natural resources, create well-paying jobs for Canadian workers in the mining sector and grow our economy,"" said Minister of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc.

# Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund

The Canadian government is also continuing to invest heavily in building the infrastructure needed to support critical mineral projects across the nation.

Launched in 2023, the C$1.5 billion ($1 billion) Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund is addressing the nation's infrastructure gaps to connect critical mineral projects to markets through clean energy, electrification, and transportation infrastructure projects.

From C$60 million ($41 million) to support [highway and hydroelectricity projects in British Columbia and the Yukon](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2024/09/27/news/ottawa-invests-60m-in-northern-bc-yukon/8720.html) to C$43.5 million ($34.5 million) to [fast-track Quebec's mining and mineral processing infrastructure](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/02/12/tech-metals/ottawa-boosts-quebecs-critical-minerals/2134.html), Canada's Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund has already conditionally approved over C$300 million ($207 million) to support more than 30 critical minerals infrastructure projects across the nation.

During his presentation at the PDAC convention, Wilkinson invited businesses and governments in Canada to apply for another $500 million ($346 million), which is now available under a second call for Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund proposals.

""Better infrastructure is key to Canada's critical minerals supply chain,"" said Minister of Transport and International Trade Anita Anand. ""With up to $500 million in new funding under the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, we are accelerating mining and expanding critical mineral development, advancing clean energy and strengthening our economy.""

The expanded initiatives announced in Toronto support Canada's whole-of-government strategy to become a superpower when it comes to delivering the minerals and metals needed for high-tech and clean energy in the 21st century.

""With over $700 million in investments under the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy by the Government of Canada alone in the past two years, Canada's mining and critical minerals industry have successfully risen to the challenge of meeting the ever-increasing international demand for critical minerals,"" said Wilkinson.

# MARCH 3RD, 2025~ For Greenland’s Minerals, the Harsh Reality Behind the Glittering Promise

  
***There is excitement about the potentially lucrative resources scattered around the island, especially the rare earths. But extreme weather, fired-up environmentalists and other factors have tempered hopes of a bonanza.***

[Greenland’s Minerals: The Harsh Reality Behind the Glittering Promise - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/greenland-minerals-trump.html)

[Greenlanders have expressed caution about any new heavy industry. The island’s governing political party swept into office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and shut down one of the most promising mining projects.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times](https://preview.redd.it/k1do6b3nr1oe1.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917ccd7463b65829c1831e78e4bf5e17b227563d)

More than a decade ago, Canadian miners prospecting for diamonds in western Greenland saw on the horizon a huge white hump.

They called it White Mountain and soon discovered it was a deposit of anorthosite, a salt-and-pepper color mineral used in paints, glass fibers, flame retardants and other industries. The same mineral creates a ghostly glow on the moon’s surface.

The White Mountain deposit proved to be several miles long and several miles wide, and “only God knows how deep it goes,” said Bent Olsvig Jensen, the managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials, the company mining the area.

Lumina is backed by European and Canadian investors, but Mr. Jensen said it wasn’t easy to turn the deposit into a mountain of cash.

“You cannot do exploration all year round; you are in the Arctic,” he explained.

He told of fierce winds grounding helicopters and knocking out communications, pack ice blocking ships and temperatures dropping to such a dreadful low — sometimes minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit — that the hydraulic fluid powering the company’s digging machines “becomes like butter.”

Sitting in Lumina’s humble offices in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, with wet snow flakes scissoring down outside the windows, Mr. Jensen brought a dose of sobriety to all the talk of Greenland as the land of incalculable mineral riches. He noted that though the island has dozens of exploratory projects, there are only two active mines: his and a small gold operation.

The gigantic semiautonomous island in the Arctic has seized the world’s attention after President Trump insisted in January that the United States [take it over.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/europe/greenland-trump-denmark-security.html?searchResultPosition=5) Part of the attraction is its rare earths minerals that are vital to high-tech industries and a source of competition across the world.

The natural resources agreement that Ukraine was all set to sign with the administration until the talks [spectacularly blew up on Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/28/us/trump-news) was focused on critical minerals.

The European Union is just as fixated. It recently signed a strategic minerals deal with Rwanda, which is suspected of fomenting instability in mineral-rich Congo next door.

It should be no surprise, then, that Mr. Trump and his allies are excited about Greenland’s mineral scene. Vice President JD Vance has spoken of Greenland’s “incredible natural resources,” and Republican senators recently held a hearing on [“Greenland’s Geostrategic Importance,”](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/nuuk-and-cranny-looking-at-the-arctic-and-greenland-s-geostrategic-importance-to-u-s-interests_2) highlighting its rare earths.

Tech giants like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, along with [some of Mr. Trump’s allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/howard-lutnick-greenland.html), including Howard Lutnick, his commerce secretary, have invested in companies prospecting here. According to [a recent Danish study](https://data.geus.dk/gpub-landingpage/?id=32049), 31 of 34 materials defined as critical by the European Union, like lithium and titanium, are found on the island.

But for every square on the periodic table that Greenland can fill, there’s an even longer list of challenges.

Besides the extreme weather, the island has fewer than 100 miles of roads, only 56,000 residents (which means a tiny labor pool) and a few small ports.

Equally daunting for miners is Greenland’s environmentalist lobby. Many Greenlanders [say they need more mining](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/100000009937431/trump-wants-greenland-but-what-do-greenlanders-want.html?searchResultPosition=7) to become economically and politically independent of Denmark, which keeps it afloat with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual subsidies.

But Greenlanders have also expressed caution about any new heavy industry. They are protective of their environment, which is being shaken up by climate change: The Arctic is [warming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3) nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world, which will most likely make the mineral resources more accessible.

The island’s governing political party swept into office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and shut down one of the most promising mining projects. The next elections are on March 11, and, along with independence from Denmark and closer relations with the United States, safeguarding the environment is at the top of the agenda.

For many Greenlanders, nature is a part of their identity and something they connect to through fishing, hunting, hiking and spending time outdoors.

“We have lived with nature for as long as we have been here, in sustainable ways,” said Ellen Kristensen, an environmentalist in South Greenland.

# APRIL 22nd, 2025~Supply Chain Challenges Sees Government Support for Critical Minerals-companies

[Supply Chain Challenges Sees Government Support for Critical Minerals-companies - Article | Crux Investor](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/posts/supply-chain-challenges-sees-government-support-in-critical-minerals-companies)

https://preview.redd.it/5r6yho6uddwe1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9861a7a1820280136b817e323178ea92d7f2dee

* **Recent trade tensions and tariffs have disrupted metals markets, causing short-term price volatility but potentially creating long-term opportunities for companies with strategic positioning.**
* **Critical minerals including rare earths, titanium, copper, and nickel face supply chain challenges due to Chinese dominance, prompting Western nations to pursue alternative sources and strategic investments.**
* **Government and non-Chinese funding support for critical minerals is accelerating globally, starting with the US implementing its Executive Order to boost domestic production through funding, expedited permitting, and strategic initiatives.**
* **Companies focused in one or many of the critical minerals are advancing significant projects across rare earths, titanium, copper, lithium, and potash.**
* **The investment thesis for critical minerals remains strong despite market volatility, supported by supply chain diversification needs, government funding, technical barriers to entry, and growing demand from energy transition and defense applications.**

The geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities have dramatically elevated the squeeze on critical minerals—rare earths, titanium, copper, and nickel. These have emerged as crucial components in the global push toward energy transition, defense applications, and technological advancement.

The global market for critical minerals has been largely dominated by Chinese production and processing capabilities, particularly for rare earth elements crucial to defense applications and electric vehicles. This concentration of supply has prompted Western nations and companies to pursue alternative sources and supply chain.

# The Market Dynamics in Trade Tensions

Recent tariff announcements have significantly disrupted global metals markets, with nickel prices retreating to 2020 levels at approximately $14,000 per ton. As industry expert Mark Selby observed,

&gt;***""Trump's done a great job basically wiping out the entire base metal complex, including nickel. So in the last few days here, we've taken prices all the way back to 2020 levels.""***

This price volatility reflects immediate market uncertainty rather than fundamental weakness in nickel's supply-demand dynamics. The implementation of wide-ranging tariffs has created confusion throughout supply chains that have developed over decades.

# states Mark Selby, CEO Canada Nick

Despite this near-term volatility, the market appears to be approaching what industry experts call the ""grand convergence,"" where various production methods approach cost parity. Current nickel prices have fallen well into the cost curve, suggesting limited additional downside potential. This cost-driven floor provides relative protection compared to other metals.

While near-term volatility persists, the fundamental supply-demand dynamics remain supportive of stable to higher prices once policy clarity emerges. As Mark Selby succinctly observes:

&gt;""This is some short-term pain, but this is, again, perversely super helpful for any of us in the critical mineral space who can sell our stuff anywhere in the world outside the United States.""

# Government Support and Strategic Funding

Policy developments in the United States have significantly strengthened the position of domestic critical mineral producers. The recent tariff announcements impacts with similar trends noted by Mark Selby in the nickel sector:

&gt;***""This Trump nonsense basically just reinforces that stack \[of government funding\] is going to show up much more vigorously and much more quickly than it had before.""***

For companies like [**American Critical Minerals**](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/companies/american-critical-minerals), with projects addressing multiple critical minerals (both potash and lithium), developments create significant opportunities for accelerated permitting and financial support. [President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) aimed at accelerating domestic production of critical minerals, including potash and lithium. American Critical Minerals Corp., which is developing the Green River Potash and Lithium Project in Utah, has welcomed this development.

In a [news release](https://acmineralscorp.com/news-releases/american-critical-minerals-applauds-us-presidential-executive-order-to-increase-expedite-domestic-critical-mineral-extraction/), President and CEO of American Critical Minerals, Simon Clarke expresses the company's take,

&gt;""We are delighted that Potash is now being officially treated as a Critical Mineral in the US. Given the growth in domestic agriculture, and the fact that potash is the major ingredient in all key fertilizers, it is clear that being reliant on foreign powers for over 92% of the potash it consumes is a threat to US Food Security.""

The Executive Order includes several provisions that could directly benefit critical mineral projects, including invoking the Defense Production Act, facilitating buyer agreements, expediting procurement, accelerating access to private and public capital, and creating a Dedicated Mineral and Mineral Production Fund for Domestic Investments administered by the Development Finance Corporation.

[**Pensana**](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/companies/pensana-plc)'s Chairman Paul Atherley added his observation highlighting EXIM's support (to [Rare Element Resources](https://www.rareelementresources.com/investor-information/news-releases/2025/03/25/rare-element-resources-announces-exim-letter-of-interest-for-bear-lodge-project-funding)) to increase the american mineral production including rare earths:

&gt;***""There is some great work being done by EXIM Bank. They have just announced a strategic critical minerals resource initiative, it's to realign supply chains to the US.***""

# Strategic Adaptations to Trade Disruptions

Companies with production flexibility across different markets hold advantages during this period of trade uncertainty. For critical mineral producers, the ability to sell into multiple markets provides resilience against market disruptions. As Selby confirms, ""All of this Trump stuff is net-net long-term helpful for us"" in terms of accelerating government funding and support for critical mineral projects outside the US market.

This disruption presents strategic opportunities for those positioned correctly in the market. Companies that can redirect production to markets outside the United States face less exposure to tariff impacts. For development-stage projects, governmental support is likely to increase as nations prioritize domestic supply chains.

[**Pensana**](https://www.cruxinvestor.com/companies/pensana-plc)'s Chairman, Paul Atherley, articulates a strategic approach beyond simple resource extraction:

&gt;***""The issue is, do you mine your product and sell at the mine gates and basically dig and ship to China, which has all the mid-stream processing, or do you start to go downstream?"" \[Pensana has chosen to\] go all the way down to produce a mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a midstream product, which can then be sent to - doesn't necessarily have to go to China - somewhere else to be turned into an oxide and ultimately a metal.""***

# The Investment Thesis for Critical Minerals

* **Supply Chain Diversification**: Companies developing resources outside China's control represent strategic investments as Western nations prioritize supply security for defense and technology applications.
* **Government Support Premium**: Projects receiving strategic government funding may achieve enhanced economics independent of market prices, creating potential value regardless of commodity price fluctuations.
* **Strategic Flexibility Advantage**: Companies with the ability to sell into multiple markets hold significant advantages in navigating trade disruptions and can potentially benefit from redirected supply chains.
* **Technical Barriers to Entry**: Demonstrated challenges in developing cost-effective processing facilities create moats for established producers and those with advantageous deposit characteristics.
* **Long-Term Demand Growth**: The energy transition, defense applications, and emerging technologies (e.g., humanoid robotics) create sustained demand growth trajectories despite near-term volatility.
* **Jurisdictional Premium**: Assets in politically stable, mining-friendly jurisdictions like Australia may command valuation premiums as supply chain security concerns intensify.
* **Strategic M&amp;A Potential**: High-quality critical mineral projects located near major deposits may become acquisition targets, as demonstrated by BHP-Lundin's C$4.5 billion acquisition of Filo Mining.
* **Vertical Integration Value**: Companies moving beyond mine-gate sales to produce midstream or downstream products may capture additional margin and strategic positioning in global supply chains.

The critical minerals sector represents a strategically vital opportunity amid global supply chain realignment. While near-term market volatility stemming from trade tensions may impact valuations, government support, technical barriers to entry, and fundamental supply-demand imbalances create compelling long-term investment cases. Companies that have secured strategic land positions, demonstrated technical feasibility, and positioned themselves within emerging non-Chinese supply chains are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this structural shift.

As governments worldwide accelerate funding for domestic critical mineral projects, investors may find asymmetric opportunities in companies that align with national strategic priorities while maintaining operational flexibility across global markets. The convergence of national security interests, energy transition requirements, and traditional mineral scarcity suggests that despite cyclical price movements, the secular trend for critical minerals remains decidedly positive.

The Trump administration has moved to expedite permitting for ten [mining](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/mining) [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) across the US as part of a broader effort to boost domestic production of critical minerals and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains.

The selected [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) – spanning [copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper), lithium, [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold), potash, and [coal](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/coal) – include developments by participants such as Rio Tinto, Hecla [Mining](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/mining), Albemarle, Warrior Met [Coal](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/coal) and Perpetua [Resources](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/resources). 

They represent the first wave of initiatives under President **Donald** **Trump**’s recent executive order aimed at increasing American mineral production.

[Projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) greenlit for fast-track permitting include Rio Tinto’s Resolution [Copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) in Arizona, Perpetua’s Stibnite [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) in Idaho, Albemarle’s Silver Peak lithium mine in Nevada, and Warrior Met [Coal](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/coal)’s Alabama [operations](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/operations). 

Also on the list are the McDermitt lithium [exploration](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/exploration) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project), Caldwell Canyon phosphate [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project), Libby and Lisbon Valley [copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects), the South West Arkansas bromine [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project), and the Michigan potash development.

The [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) have been added to the federal permitting dashboard under the FAST-41 programme, providing increased transparency and accountability in the federal [environmental](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/environmental) review process. This marks the first use of the council’s transparency authority under the critical minerals directive.

""We look forward to showcasing the many benefits the federal permitting dashboard can bring to critical [infrastructure](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/infrastructure) [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) as part of President Trump’s executive order on increasing American mineral production,” said acting executive director at the permitting council, **Manisha** **Patel**.

The designation makes permitting timelines and review milestones for each [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) publicly available.

Resolution [Copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) said that it appreciated the federal government's recognition of the role domestic [copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) production played in supporting national security, manufacturing, and economic resilience. 

""There is growing recognition of the urgent need to develop domestic sources of [copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) and other critical materials to support the nation's energy security and industrial base,"" said Resolution [Copper](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/copper) general manager **Vicky** **Peacey**. ""We are committed to playing a meaningful role in helping to deliver these materials and will continue to engage constructively in the national dialogue."" 

Peacey said Resolution remained committed to an inclusive, and respectful collaborative process that incorporates feedback from local communities, Tribal Nations and all stakeholders. 

""More than a decade of extensive consultation and collaboration with Native American Tribes and local communities has directly led to major changes to the [mining](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/mining) plan to preserve and reduce potential impacts on cultural interests, and this ongoing dialogue will continue to shape the [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project),"" said Peacey.

Meanwhile, Perpetua president and CEO **Jon** **Cherry** said that being recognised as a transparency [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) by the White House underscored the strategic value of the Stibnite [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project), which is uniquely positioned to supply the critical mineral antimony – essential to national security and energy technology.

He said that Trump's executive order was right to recognise that if the US was going to compete against China, it had to deploy federal tools to even the playing field for domestic [mining](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/mining) [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects). 

""Defense Production Act Title III awards, the US Export-Import Bank's China Transformational Exports Programme and Make More in America initiative, and other programmes that extend capital for critical mineral production can help meaningfully push back against China's attempts to clinch global control over critical minerals,"" Cherry stated.

The Stibnite [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) is poised to produce [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold) and the only domestically mined source of antimony. With China's recent ban on antimony exports to the US, the [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) represents a crucial step toward restoring American supply chain resilience. The Stibnite [gold](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/gold) [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) could supply up to 35% of US antimony demand during its initial six years of production, based on the 2023 US Geological Survey antimony commodity summary.

The final federal decision, the US Army Corps of Engineers Clean Water Act 404 permit, is on track for a decision in the second quarter.

Meanwhile, Australia-based Jindalee CEO **Ian** **Rodger** said that being included among the first ten FAST-41 transparency [projects](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/projects) validated the McDermitt lithium [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project)'s strategic importance to US mineral security.

The McDermitt [project](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/project) hosts one of the largest lithium [resources](https://www.miningweekly.com/topic/resources) in the US, positioning it as a potentially significant contributor to the country’s clean energy transition and domestic battery supply chain

# NIOCORP MENTIONED: APRIL 21st, 2025~Geopolitical Factors Reshape Rare Earth Mineral Supply Chain – What’s Next?

Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of 17 metals essential for various modern technologies. Applications include electric vehicle motors, such as the approximately 2.5 kg of neodymium used in a Tesla Model Y, and defense systems. An F-35 aircraft incorporates over 900 pounds of REEs, while a Virginia-class submarine utilizes 9,200 pounds. The global supply chain for these materials, long defined by China’s market dominance, is experiencing shifts due to geopolitical actions. These include export controls implemented by China, efforts by the United States to increase domestic supply, and negotiations involving Ukraine’s mineral resources. What’s next for rare earth minerals?

https://preview.redd.it/7eopm5a4ddwe1.png?width=320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e199c50b7b4cf794ce04efd62b6402f11e5f962

China has a dominant position in the global rare earth market. It accounts for nearly two-thirds of global raw REE mining and controls the majority of the subsequent processing stages, particularly for heavy REEs, where its processing share approached 100 percent until recently. In early April 2025, China implemented new export restrictions targeting seven medium and heavy rare earths—samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—as well as magnets derived from them. Exporters now require special licenses, reportedly involving processing times of 45 days or more. Concurrently, 16 US firms, primarily in the defense and aerospace sectors, were added to an export control list, restricting their access. Market data indicated immediate effects, with the price of dysprosium increasing approximately 30 percent month-over-month to $300 per kilogram in April 2025. China’s REE exports to the US reportedly decreased by 52 percent year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. These controls have been reported as both a response to US tariffs and a use of resource supply as a strategic tool.

The United States is highly reliant on imports for REEs and other critical minerals, importing 100 percent of its supply for at least 15 such minerals and sourcing over 70 percent of its REE imports from China. In response to this dependency, the US government has initiated several measures to bolster domestic supply chains. Recent executive orders focus on streamlining mine permitting processes, identifying federal lands suitable for mineral production, and employing the Defense Production Act (DPA) to support domestic industry. ***The Department of Defense has allocated over $439 million since 2020 towards establishing a domestic “mine-to-magnet” supply chain, with the stated goal of meeting US defense requirements by 2027. Efforts include supporting potential domestic projects such as the Elk Creek Project in Nebraska and the Halleck Creek deposit in Wyoming, complementing existing operations like MP Materials in Mountain Pass, California, which mainly processes light REEs.*** Significant challenges remain, including long mine development timelines (averaging 18-29 years in the US), high capital costs ($500 million to $1 billion reported for a mine and separation plant), environmental regulations, and a lack of sufficient domestic capacity for processing heavy REEs.

Ukraine has substantial mineral resources and has become a factor in global REE supply discussions. The country holds deposits of 22 out of 34 materials designated as critical by the European Union, including significant lithium, graphite, and titanium reserves. Estimates suggest Ukraine holds around 5 percent of global REE reserves, although assessments of commercial viability often rely on Soviet-era geological surveys conducted 30 to 60 years ago. Negotiations are ongoing between the US and Ukraine regarding potential access to these minerals, possibly linked to US aid. Reports indicate Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has expressed caution regarding the terms, while other officials see potential benefits. An outline agreement was reportedly signed recently. The ongoing conflict significantly complicates resource development. Reports indicate approximately 20 percent of Ukraine’s mineral deposits and about 50 percent of its potential REE deposits are located in Russian-occupied or contested areas. Damage to infrastructure, particularly energy generation vital for mining, presents another major obstacle. Russia has also reportedly offered the US joint ventures in occupied Ukrainian territories. Substantial investment and modern exploration would be required to develop these resources, contingent on security and stability.

China’s established control over REE processing and its recent export restrictions have prompted the US to intensify efforts aimed at supply chain diversification and domestic production enhancement. Ukraine presents potential mineral resources, but development faces significant geopolitical and practical hurdles due to the ongoing conflict and uncertain economic viability based on current data. These dynamics will likely contribute to increased price volatility in critical mineral markets, and a global push towards developing alternative REE sources and processing capabilities outside of China.

China currently dominates global refining for critical minerals essential to modern economies — including lithium, cobalt, nickel, natural graphite, and rare earth elements — making it the primary supplier of processed inputs for advanced technologies, such as semiconductors, aerospace components, energy storage systems, and electric vehicle batteries. Even minerals mined outside of China are often sent to Chinese-owned smelting and processing plants. This near-monopoly grants Beijing significant leverage over global supply chains, heightening concerns over U.S. dependence on Chinese-controlled refining operations. China’s [recent](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) export controls on processed rare earth elements, issued in response to U.S. tariffs, bring into focus this strategic vulnerability.

The U.S. military depends heavily on these minerals for a variety of [defense applications](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/national-security/). For example, gallium-arsenide chips are used in electronic warfare systems that power the [AN/ALQ-99 jamming pod](https://www.navair.navy.mil/product/ALQ-99-Tactical-Jamming-System), neodymium-iron-boron magnets are [critical](https://www.sfa-oxford.com/knowledge-and-insights/critical-minerals-in-low-carbon-and-future-technologies/critical-minerals-in-defence-and-national-security/) to the F-35’s flight control systems, and antimony is used in ammunition and artillery shells. These dependencies underscore the national security risks posed by China’s dominance in critical mineral refining.

Although encouraging private sector investments in refining, friendshoring, stockpiling resources, and streamlining permits has been helpful, these efforts fail to address a core issue: The United States lacks domestic refining and advanced processing capabilities. To achieve true mineral independence, the United States should adopt offensive industrial policies that build up the mineral refining sector. This requires establishing a federal initiative for critical mineral processing that builds on existing efforts by expanding funding, prioritizing states with optimal conditions for facilities, streamlining permitting, investing in workforce development, and securing allied supply chains.

**Current Defensive Solutions Help but Face Significant Hurdles**

China has historically weaponized its mineral dominance by imposing export restrictions on strategic materials to pressure rival economies. In [2010](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/revisiting-china-japan-rare-earths-dispute-2010), China restricted [rare earth elements exports](https://www.netl.doe.gov/resource-sustainability/critical-minerals-and-materials/rare-earth-elements) to Japan amid a territorial dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, triggering price spikes worldwide. In [2023](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_germanium_and_gallium.pdf) and [2024](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2024/long-term-outlook-of-gallium-remains-uncertain/), China imposed export controls on germanium and gallium, which are critical for semiconductor production. The United States has taken different approaches in response to these restrictions. After China’s 2010 rare earth elements embargo, the United States, the European Union, and Japan filed a [case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earths_trade_dispute) against China at the World Trade Organization, ultimately forcing Beijing to remove export quotas by 2015. The United States also [revived](https://www.geologyforinvestors.com/mountain-pass-americas-once-and-future-rare-earth-king/) rare earth mineral processing, including efforts to reopen the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine in California. In 2023, Washington intensified its “[friendshoring](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/05/friendshoring-critical-minerals-what-could-the-us-and-its-partners-produce?lang=en)” strategy by allocating additional resources to domestic mining and refining through the Department of Defense and Department of Energy budgets, while also strengthening supply chain partnerships with allies like Canada and Australia.

U.S. efforts to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals face a number of significant hurdles. First, domestic refining expansion remains slow, with new processing plants and smelters taking 10–20 years to become operational. For example, the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine, which reopened after China’s 2010 export controls, still sent [98 percent](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_rare_earths_part_1.pdf) of its raw materials to China in 2019 due to the lack of U.S. processing capacity.

Investors are hesitant to fund U.S. refining and processing facilities due to [uncertain returns](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/A-Critical-Minerals-Policy-for-the-United-States-Final-Report.pdf), shifting federal policies, political instability, and environmental [opposition](https://www.erm.com/insights/critical-minerals-how-the-mining-sector-can-accelerate-the-energy-transition/). High-capital expenditures make mining and processing less attractive to investors, especially when compared to tech sectors that require minimal upfront investment and offer higher returns. Additionally, China maintains a fully integrated supply chain — from extraction to refining, smelting, and manufacturing — making it far cheaper and more efficient to process minerals domestically than in the United States. Expanding U.S. domestic mineral extraction is also challenging, as moving from exploration to consultation and full-scale operations can take at least a decade.

Even if extraction increases, investors remain concerned that Chinese firms could [flood](https://www.wsj.com/business/china-us-critical-minerals-fight-50b5cbda) the market with minerals to drive down prices and make U.S. operations financially unsustainable. This played out with lithium in 2023, when oversupply triggered a sharp drop in prices. Similarly, although not driven by deliberate economic policies, nickel prices fell in 2024 due to overproduction by Chinese firms focused on short-term profits. This trend was further amplified by the adoption of a new chemical [processing](https://www.strausscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Alvin-Camba-Indonesia-Memo.pdf) technique that significantly boosted output. Because extraction and refining must scale together to create a cost-effective, fully integrated U.S. supply chain, these barriers severely hinder progress.

Second, while capacity is gradually expanding, alternatives to Chinese processing and refining remain. In Japan, companies like [Sumitomo](https://www.smm.co.jp/en/corp_info/location/overseas_group/) Metal Mining have historically focused on refining nickel and cobalt, but the government has recently [taken](https://www.sojitz.com/en/news/article/20230307.html) steps to expand rare earth refining. The Australian government is also scaling up support for rare earths processing, providing [grants](https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/king/media-releases/supporting-rare-earths-processing-future-made-australia) to firms such as Australian Strategic Materials Limited and extending [financing](https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/king/media-releases/additional-help-rare-earths-refining-future-made-australia) to Iluka Resources. In South Korea, [Korean Zinc Company, Ltd.](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/korea-zinc-talks-with-us-buyers-supply-antimony-chairman-says-2025-01-09/); POSCO Future M Company, Ltd.; and LS-Nikko Copper Inc. are active in [mineral processing](https://www.kedglobal.com/batteries/newsView/ked202411190004). Despite the efforts of these three countries, China still dominates [85 percent](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/14/rare-earth-mines-00071102) of rare earth refining, [90 percent](https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog/post/57351/china-is-the-worlds-leading-graphite-pro) of global graphite processing, and nearly all of germanium, gallium, and tungsten refining. Japan, Australia, and South Korea also face capacity constraints, higher processing costs, and competing [domestic priorities](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/south-koreas-demand-for-critical-minerals/) that limit their ability to fully support U.S. demand. Moreover, their geographic [proximity](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/asia-new-center-geopolitics) to China heightens their vulnerability in the event of armed conflict.

Third, while stockpiles can provide a temporary [buffer](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235963503_Limits_to_the_critical_raw_materials_approach), they do not eliminate the need for secure, long-term supply chains, as reserves will eventually deplete. China’s [dominance](https://optilogic.com/resources/blog/how-chinas-rare-earth-metals-export-ban-will-impact-supply-chains/) in the sector makes it difficult for the United States to determine optimal stockpile levels, especially given competing demands between military and civilian industries. Current forecasting models, such as those developed by the [Institute for Defense Analyses](https://ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/d/da/dataworks-2022-forecasting-with-machine-learning/ns-d-33017-dataworks_forecasting_final.ashx), include considerations for critical civilian sectors. However, these models do not account for the downstream impacts of supply disruptions across the broader industrial base. Additionally, stockpiling is [costly](https://www.irena.org/Digital-Report/Geopolitics-of-the-Energy-Transition-Critical-Materials), requiring specialized storage, maintenance, and periodic replenishment to prevent material degradation. Adding to the complexity, China’s ability to [manipulate](https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/how-can-a-financial-reserve-maintain-supply-of-domestic-critical-minerals) mineral markets complicates U.S. procurement strategies: If prices surge, replenishing stockpiles becomes prohibitively expensive, whereas price crashes reduce incentives for domestic extraction and refining.

Fourth, streamlining permits is often proposed as part of a solution, but it alone does not guarantee rapid resource extraction. Mining projects typically take [15–20](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/discovery-to-production-averages-15-7-years-for-127-mines) years to reach full-scale production due to a lengthy process involving exploration, feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and construction. Political shifts between administrations frequently result in [policy reversals](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/permit-times-for-mining-exploration-how-long-are-they.pdf) on environmental regulations, creating uncertainty for long-term investments. Additionally, local opposition and legal challenges can cause significant delays, as seen with the [Thacker Pass lithium mine](https://nevadacurrent.com/2023/02/07/thacker-pass-lithium-mine-clears-most-legal-challenges-minus-a-judge-ordered-waste-rock-review/) in Nevada, which, despite its potential to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate, has faced years of lawsuits and protests that have stalled progress.

Efforts to secure mineral independence remain incomplete, with one of the most pressing challenges being the absence of robust domestic refining and smelting capacity within the United States.

**The Limits of Previous Funding Initiatives**

The Biden administration created funding initiatives aimed at strengthening critical mineral supply chains. These included the Inflation Reduction Act, Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act, and Defense Production Act, each of which played a role in supporting the domestic industry. The Inflation Reduction Act provided subsidies for battery production and clean energy initiatives, generating over $224 billion in investments. The [CHIPS Act](https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/08/two-years-later-funding-chips-and-science-act-creating-quality-jobs-growing-local) allocated $30 billion to private sector projects across 15 states, supporting the construction of 16 new semiconductor manufacturing facilities and creating more than 115,000 manufacturing jobs. However, these initiatives remain too fragmented, with resources spread across various agencies with competing priorities, rather than focusing on scaling up refining and metallurgical processing. The Defense Production Act, arguably the most impactful initiative, allocated $150 million specifically to critical minerals, funding key projects such as [$19 million](https://thefederalnewswire.com/stories/664558723-department-of-defense-awards-19-million-to-establish-domestic-tin-processing-facility) for a tin smelting and refining facility in Pennsylvania, [$37.5](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-37-5-million-department-of-defense-grant-under-the-defense-production-act/) million for developing the Graphite Creek deposit and refining operations in Alaska, and over [$100 million](https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/customer_files/pdfs/critical_minerals_alliances_2024.pdf) to establish a U.S.-based rare earth separation plant.

Biden also expanded Department of Energy initiatives and increased Department of Defense contracts to boost domestic production. The Department of Energy allocated [$19.5 million](https://netl.doe.gov/node/14182) toward securing domestic supply chains, and the administration budgeted an additional [$43 million](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/funding-notice-fiscal-year-2024-vehicle-technologies-office-batteries-funding) to enhance battery technologies for electric vehicles. However, a greater portion of the Department of Energy’s overall funding — particularly the Office of Science Financial Assistance Program’s [$500 million](https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/department-energy-announces-500-million-basic-research-advance-frontiers-science) open call — was distributed across a range of areas only marginally connected to critical resources or mineral processing, such as fusion energy sciences, nuclear physics, and biological and environmental research. The Defense Department awarded a [$26.4 million](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3912485/department-of-defense-awards-264-million-for-low-cost-domestic-production-of-hi/) grant to support a niobium refining plant in Pennsylvania. Yet, this remains just one project among many shortcomings in the effort to establish a self-sufficient U.S. supply chain.

Despite these notable investments, Biden-era initiatives largely failed to directly and adequately address refining and smelting, leaving a critical gap in the supply chain. Current funding levels remain insufficient to close the structural deficit in domestic processing capacity, keeping the United States dependent on foreign supply chains for critical minerals.

**A Federal Critical Mineral Processing Initiative: The Path to U.S. Independence from China**

Currently, the Department of Defense lacks a strong rationale to invest billions in processing facilities or mines, given that it is widely understood that military demand for critical minerals represents only a small [fraction](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47982) of overall usage. Although exact figures for defense consumption of these materials are difficult to estimate, U.S. military consumption of rare earth elements, for instance, accounts for less than [0.1 percent](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-107176) of global demand. Nevertheless, there are strong national security reasons to subsidize the industry. Military demand is projected to [triple](https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/news-publications/inside-supply-management-magazine/blog/2022/2022-07/rare-earth-metal-supply-chains-move-into-mainstream/) — from $15 billion in 2022 to $46 billion by 2046. Most global processing capacity is concentrated in China, a strategic rival to the United States in multiple ways. The private sector is unlikely to make significant investments without substantial government backing. Furthermore, many of these materials are irreplaceable in key defense systems. Any supply disruption could result in production delays or directly undermine combat readiness.

A federal critical mineral processing initiative is essential to eliminate U.S. dependence on China for critical minerals. Congress will need to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few decades. Replacing China’s copper smelting and refining capacity alone would require approximately [$85 billion](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/news/wood-mackenzie-moving-awat-from-china-could-hamper-energy-transition/). To jumpstart this initiative, Congress should allocate $20–40 billion of seed and debt funding over the next decade through a Critical Minerals Industrial Act, forming a strategic public-private partnership that incentivizes U.S. firms to invest in and expand refining and smelting facilities. This legislation will differ from the [Critical Minerals Security Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3631/text) of 2024, which emphasizes reporting and recommendations, and the [Critical Mineral Consistency Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/714/text) of 2025, which prioritizes transparency.

Once funding is allocated, the first step would be to ensure effective fund distribution across key investment areas. Grants and tax rebates should be provided to U.S. companies investing in refining, smelting, and metallurgical processing. Additionally, public-private partnerships should be established to enable U.S. companies — such as those in technology, aerospace, energy storage, automotive, and defense — to serve as offtake partners, securing lower refining and smelting costs in exchange for long-term supply commitments. Federal agencies such as the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, and the International Development Finance Corporation should expand low-interest loan programs to support domestic processing facilities. To shield these investments from political shifts, the Defense Production Act should be used to fast-track funding for these projects.

The second step would be to strategically select U.S. states with the most favorable conditions for large-scale refining and smelting operations. These states must have ample land, mining-friendly laws, proximity to ports or mineral deposits, and existing infrastructure. Optimal locations include Texas, Arizona, Utah, and West Virginia, all of which offer strong regulatory environments and existing industrial capacity. Oklahoma would also be a possible location. Governor Kevin Stitt has offered incentive [packages](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/04/25/panasonic-project-ocean-oklahoma-governor-signs-lucrative-business-incentive-proposal/7439441001/) to relocate processing facilities to the state. Utah, which also has lithium, beryllium, and tungsten deposits, is home to [Kennecott Utah Copper](https://www.riotinto.com/en/operations/us/kennecott), a division of Rio Tinto, which operates the Bingham Canyon Mine — already equipped with smelting and refining facilities that contribute eight percent of U.S. annual copper production. [Rare earth elements](https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/wvu-awarded-8-million-to-extract-rare-earth-elements-from-mine-waste) in coal-related streams, including acid mine drainage and coal waste byproducts, have been discovered in West Virginia. However, the process of extracting these elements is not yet commercially viable. Texas offers a [pro-business legal environment](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/business-climate), no state income tax, and strong [port infrastructure](https://www.portofbrownsville.com/expanding-capabilities/) for importing raw materials. Arizona has [fast-tracked](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/documents/files/az-mine-permit-guide.pdf) mining permit laws and access to large reserves of copper, lithium, and rare earth elements. Currently, California’s Mountain Pass Mine Rare Earth Mine, operated by [MP Materials](https://mpmaterials.com/), is the only active rare earth mining and processing facility in the United States.

The third step deals with streamlining the permitting process for refineries and smelters. In China, smelters often take two to three years to obtain permits. By contrast, the process takes 7 to 10 years in the United States. According to an [S&amp;P Global Report](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf), it takes an average of 29 years to bring a new mine online in the United States, making it the second slowest country in the world for mine development. For example, the [Thacker Pass lithium](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2024/Lithium-Americas-Provides-a-Thacker-Pass-Construction-Plan-Update/default.aspx) project submitted its initial operations plan in August 2019, but it was not until 2024 that the Department of Energy finalized a loan to support its development, including the construction of a sulfuric acid plant and a lithium processing facility. Similarly, the [Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine](https://www.eurare.org/docs/internalGuidanceReport.pdf) secured its environmental permits in 2010 to construct a new rare earth processing facility but did not complete construction until [2014](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1489137/000148913715000007/mcp1231201410k.htm), even though it had on-site processing facilities that smelt and refine rare earth ore into finished products. These delays might be mitigated by using the existing fast-track approval process established under the [Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/fastact/) of 2015 to accelerate the development of critical mineral infrastructure. This legislation is particularly well-suited for this role, as it streamlines permitting for projects that already exist and are supported by federal investment programs.

The fourth step focuses on workforce development to ensure the United States has the necessary manpower to operate these facilities. By 2029, an estimated [221,000 workers](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/08/why-the-us-has-a-serious-mining-worker-shortage.html?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin%7Cmain) in the mining sector will retire. Given the scale of expansion required in both mining and refining, the United States will need four to five times that number of workers. The workforce challenge is exacerbated by several factors: an [aging](https://www.mining.com/web/mining-industry-dogged-by-retirements-and-lack-of-new-recruits/) workforce due to retirements; [declining](https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-needs-more-mining-engineers-solve-its-critical-mineral-challenges) academic programs, as many universities have shut down metallurgy and materials science programs because of declining student interest; and an economic shift away from heavy industry, resulting in a lack of training opportunities for young professionals to enter the field. Currently, only 14 Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology-accredited programs remain, including the University of Utah, West Virginia University, and the Colorado School of Mines. The U.S. government provides limited financial support for programs, such as the [Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers](https://research.njit.edu/materials-research-science-and-engineering-centers-mrsec-0). Recent legislation and programs, including the Mining Schools Act (which allocated [$10 million](https://www.myjournalcourier.com/opinion/article/invest-mining-overcome-dominance-19980846.php) from 2024 to 2031) and the National Science Foundation’s [Regional Innovation Engines Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/regional-innovation-engines), provides funding for these partnerships. While the government has rightly maintained support for these initiatives, they still fall short of addressing the scale of the challenge.

Alternatively, the United States could import skilled workers from abroad. However, the U.S. immigration process for highly skilled workers is [notoriously slow](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/unlocking-potential-high-skilled-immigrants/), and national security [concerns](https://apnews.com/article/chinese-student-republican-visa-ban-946e613a8dace3b0092580fa6fe4e50b) may limit foreign student enrollment in metallurgy programs. Additionally, global competition for talent is fierce, with countries like China, Australia, Canada, and Germany actively recruiting the same workforce. The U.S. government must allocate massive sums of funding to expand training programs and rebuild the talent pipeline.

Finally, once these four steps are in place, the United States should strengthen allied supply chains by requiring all federally funded defense, infrastructure, and energy products to [use](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-treasury-allows-miners-access-clean-energy-manufacturing-subsidy-2024-10-24/) 100 percent U.S.-processed critical minerals. Furthermore, the United States should also deepen trade [partnerships](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership) with Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea to jointly invest in refining and diversifying raw materials, and to secure long-term off-take contracts with private and government partners. Existing frameworks, such as the State Department’s [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership) — a multilateral initiative with 14 countries aimed at strengthening critical mineral supply chains — and [AUKUS](https://www.pm.gov.au/media/joint-leaders-statement-aukus), the trilateral security partnership focused on advanced technologies and critical materials, provide a foundation for advancing this strategy.

**Conclusion**

Given the urgency to break away from Chinese dependence, pursuing these five steps to secure U.S. mineral independence is not only a matter of economic security, but one of national survival. Without a federal critical minerals processing initiative, the U.S. government can use the Defense Production Act to seize access to raw materials, but that power has clear limits — especially in sustaining production over time. The government can also seize domestically available mineral stockpiles. However, as of 2022, the United States remained [more](https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/mineral-commodity-summaries-us-geological-survey-2024-report) than 50 percent import-dependent for 51 nonfuel mineral commodities and fully reliant on imports for 15 of them.

On the processing and smelting side, seizure is only the first step. Without domestic capacity to refine these materials, they remain militarily useless. In an armed conflict with China, the United States would lose access to critical Chinese processing facilities. Existing U.S. processing capabilities are limited, and without serious investment, the Department of Defense would face real constraints in scaling production. This is not theoretical: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate [ventilator production](https://som.yale.edu/blog/usage-of-the-defense-production-act-throughout-history-and-to-combat-covid-19), yet still encountered major delays due to limited industrial infrastructure. Compounding the issue is the U.S. reliance on foreign-owned intellectual property for key defense technologies. The Defense Production Act cannot override or replicate proprietary [intellectual property](https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/customer_files/pdfs/critical_minerals_alliances_2024.pdf) in areas like microelectronics, rare earth processing, advanced battery chemistries, or the specialty alloys used in hypersonic and stealth systems. Without access to that knowledge or the means to replace it, even seized raw materials cannot be turned into military capability at scale.

**Subject:** Five Questions as we head into 2025!

Good Afternoon, Jim!

   As we wait with many....  I've gotta ask a few more questions leading up to a years end 2024 **REDDIT REVIEW** &amp; the AGM! Rumor has it team Niocorp is in talks with the new administration as 2025 approaches. 

Jim - As 2024 nears an end- Trade Tariffs, China, Critical Minerals &amp; a new administration are on deck. The table is set for Critical Minerals to take center stage.

1. *\*\*\*Are several entities such as (DoD, U.S. &amp; Allied Governments &amp; Private Industries) “STILL” Interested securing Off-take Agreements for Niocorp's remaining Critical Minerals (Titanium, Niobium 25%, Rare Earths, CaCO3, MgCO3 &amp; some Iron stuff* ***as 2025 approaches?****) - Should Financing be secured??*

 ***RESPONSE:***

***""Several USG agencies are working with us to potentially provide financing to the Elk Creek Project.  And, yes, we are in discussions with the National Defense Stockpile, which (like much of the USG) is much more intensely interested in seeing U.S. production of scandium catalyze a variety of defense and commercial technologies.""***

# APRIL 13th, 2025~Trump plans order to enable critical metals stockpiling: Financial Times[U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is planning an executive order to allow the stockpiling of critical metals from the Pacific seabed, according to the Financial Times.](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/#facebook)

Trump has already invoked emergency powers to boost the ability of the U.S. to produce critical minerals as part of a broad effort to ramp up the development of domestic natural resources and make the country less reliant on foreign imports, especially from China.

There is a broader push to fast-track deep-sea mining applications under U.S. law and the stockpile of the metals, including traces of rare earth minerals, is being considered as part that effort, the [FT reported](https://www.ft.com/content/2205fc9a-67b5-4112-9b7f-cd89d011f5bb), citing people familiar with the plans. It would give U.S. access to an inventory of critical minerals in its own territory in case of a conflict with China, the newspaper reported, citing another person familiar with the matter.

China is by far the world’s biggest supplier of rare earth minerals, which comprise 17 elements in the periodic table. It accounts for almost 70% of the world’s production of rare earths, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Amid growing geopolitical trade tensions, Beijing has said that it will tighten controls on exports of seven types of rare earths.

# APRIL 11th, 2025~Status and Outlook for the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office

[Status and Outlook for the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office | Insights | Holland &amp; Knight](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/04/status-and-outlook-for-the-us-department-of-energys-loan-programs)

# Highlights

* The Trump Administration is leveraging the U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office (LPO) as a strategic tool to catalyze private sector investment in energy infrastructure. This approach aims to enhance U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, strengthen supply chains and reinforce the nation's energy dominance.
* The LPO aligns with Trump Administration goals by being an extremely cost-effective policy tool. It leverages the government's balance sheet at a fraction of the cost of grants or tax credits, enabling the deployment of billions of dollars for critical energy projects that create jobs and drive down costs for consumers.
* The recent resurgence of the LPO is largely due to statutory changes made by the 2020 Bipartisan Energy Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. These laws expanded the program's accessibility, reduced fees, clarified lending terms and introduced new programs to finance clean energy and infrastructure projects.

Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on this subreddit. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear)

I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. 

No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. 

There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. 

Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours)

Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. 
There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere.

Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc.

Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. 

Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. 

Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD
PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. 

Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. 

There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. 

The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

Please reach out if you have any comments! ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.681786,2024-12-01T03:45:40,Rio Tinto,2024

Like if someone with strong experience, both in or outside of the industry, told him to step down as he is part of the problem, would he step down. 

Or does Rugby Australia owe Rennie an apology? 

Will people still come out for wallabies test matches next year?  

Can you really just blame lack of centralisation for the bad results and leave it at that. 

But unfortunately alot of the interview goes on about Eddie, he's gone now. what's the plan for the fucking future. 

He says grassroots and state reformation through centralisation and alignment. He acknowledges the system is broken.

 They go on to talk about branding, how the wallabies brand is damaged, he states it can bounce back referencing the springboks after 2017, saying victory is needed. 

He is then compared to Qantas and Rio Tinto ceos stepping down due lack of accountability, and asked what's the difference in sporting industry compared to regular corporate industry. He says that because he is passionate about rugby, he should therefore stay. 

Then was the wallabies 2023 campaign overbudget?, apparently yes. apparently significantly so. 

Goes onto to talk about Eddie talking to Japan before the RWC and his personal feelings on the matter, states Eddie's agent and Eddie confirmed that there was nothing in it. Says time will tell if he lied or not.

 Talks about how he took the job when no one wanted it, and that Phil Waugh will be an extremely competent CEO.

 Talks about how alot of past CEOs and Chairman's were old boys from the Shore School and if that's nepotism. He states it's purely coincidental, and is then asked about the games elite status problem. He says they are trying to make it less so by spreading the RWC to every states, by planning to invest more into grassroots in the future and how they want Western Sydney suburbs access for talent. 

The tineline for the alignment and centralisation of Australian rugby is that it depends on the different state unions. 

Goes on about how they need a strong team to captalise on lions, rwc 2027 and wrwc 2029.

That the new wallabies coach recruitment process will be as transparent as possible, says the role is still very attractive. The qualifications needed of the coach will be decided by the Rugby committee. 

Then starts on what his personal and subsequent families mental health is after this ordeal of 2023. 

Finishes on that the 2027 cup will deliver 2 and a 1/2 billion dollars to Australia with RA getting 100 million dollar check from it.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.681800,2023-11-08T23:44:34,Rio Tinto,2023

My reason for taking the program is because:
1) I like engineering
2) I want to go into mining and Australia has a well developed mining sector
3) In Australia It seems WA is where most of the FIFO jobs are so I’d like to be closer to that area for networking opportunities and to familiarise myself with the environment.

What I’ve heard:
1) ECU is less prestigious but has been steadily developing its reputation and is good now
2) Life at ECU is more manageable I.e the lecturers teach better, are more supportive and campus vibe is better
3) Best companies only want people from prestigious universities so Curtin is better
4) Curtin is over crowded and less supportive teaching community

*shall we assume my average is 65% should I graduate from Curtin and 72% from ECU 

My Questions:

1) How will going to ECU affect me getting into a good company say Rio Tinto or BHP as compared to Curtin

2) Neither of these programs seem to be accredited so how does that affect my career trajectory? Do I need to do some exams to be accredited and then become an engineer? 

3) in Australia have you seen it be difficult for internationals to land good FIFO grad programs? I assume to remedy this I should do extra activities and internships thus maybe its better to go ECU because I’ll have more time and support to do this? I haven’t heard good things about Curtin support so I’m just assuming here

I already have an internship with DeBeers, marketing director in my current chess club, the project director for Engineering Without Boarders and did private tutoring for 2 months.

This thread is quite long so I really appreciate any help you decide to give",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.681808,2025-01-31T00:57:59,RT,2025

[The Pentagon is seen from the air in Washington, U.S., March 3, 2022. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/File Photo](https://preview.redd.it/qz054930p1oe1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1df90ac5f4bc776b6b3386b75a257968854725)

* Plan aims to counter China's control over critical minerals

* ***Trump doesn't plan to establish critical minerals stockpile, sources say***

March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump aims to build metals refining facilities on Pentagon military bases as part of his plan to boost domestic production of critical minerals and offset China's control of the sector, two senior administration officials told Reuters. The move is one of several planned for an executive order Trump could sign as soon as Wednesday after he told [the U.S. Congress last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-address-congress-after-upending-us-foreign-domestic-policies-2025-03-04/) he would ""take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.""

As part of the order, the Pentagon would work with other federal agencies to install processing facilities on its bases, according to the sources, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the administration's deliberations. Using military bases for processing would underscore the importance Trump is placing on critical minerals for national security. Fighter jets, submarines, bullets and other weaponry used by the U.S. military are built with minerals processed by Beijing. Trump also plans to name a critical minerals czar, similar to steps previous presidents have taken to coordinate Washington's focus on other areas, according to one of the sources. The plans are under discussion and could change before Trump signs the order, the sources added.

Some Trump administration officials were spooked by initial signs that China might [restrict critical minerals exports](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-curbs-exports-strategic-minerals-2025-02-04/) as part of its retaliation for Trump's tariffs or for other reasons, according to a person familiar with their thinking.The U.S. National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. With the Pentagon controlling about 30 million acres of land, the plan would ensure there is available land for the refining facilities, avoiding the controversy that sometimes occurs in host local communities. It would also avoid the need to buy land and avoid using land controlled by other federal department.

# A plan that prioritizes metals processing - rather than an overhaul of U.S. mine permitting -could irk U.S. miners but address a longstanding concern from manufacturers that China controls too much of the global metals processing sector. China is a top global producer of 30 of the 50 minerals considered critical by the U.S. Geological Survey, for example. It's not clear how Trump's plan for processing facilities on Pentagon bases could work from a regulatory perspective, as the U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act would still apply to Pentagon bases and those regulations have hindered private development of processing projects in the past. Trump previously signaled a willingness for alternative uses of lands controlled by Washington. As a presidential candidate, he pledged to open up portions of federal land for [large-scale housing construction](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-new-proposals-did-trump-make-during-his-economic-speech-2024-09-05/), with zones that would be ""ultra-low tax and ultra-low regulation.""

Trump does not plan in the order to establish a U.S. critical minerals stockpile that would mimic the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the sources said, a step that some in the administration and mining industry had sought. China stockpiles some critical minerals, including cobalt, and the U.S. government last year considered [stockpiling the metal](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/), which is used in missiles, aerospace parts, magnets for communication, and radar and guidance systems. Trump also does not plan to order the Pentagon or other U.S. agencies to require vendors to use only U.S. minerals, what is known as a ""Buy American"" mandate, and one that junior miners especially have said is needed to offset [China's market manipulations](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-miners-push-higher-metals-prices-ward-off-chinese-rivals-2024-07-22/). Nor would the order try to alter the federal mine permitting process, which was set by the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, largely because such a move would require an act of Congress. However, it would aim to expand the FAST-41 permitting process for mines, building on a [step Trump took in his first term](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/trump-moves-loosen-mining-regulations-approve-projects-he-exits-2021-01-08/), according to the sources.

The order would also seek to reclassify mine waste on federal land, mimicking a step that Rio Tinto [(RIO.AX), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RIO.AX), Freeport-McMoRan [(FCX.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/FCX.N) and others have taken to tap [piles of old waste rock](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/miners-turn-bacteria-other-new-ways-leach-copper-waste-rock-2022-05-11/) at U.S. mines previously thought to be worthless.

It was not immediately clear if Trump plans to declare copper as a strategic mineral, which would allow U.S. miners of the widely used metal tap into a 10% production tax credit. Phoenix-based Freeport, the largest U.S. copper miner, told Reuters on Monday it hopes Trump takes that step, which would [save it $500 million annually](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ceraweek-freeport-sees-500-million-annual-boost-if-trump-declares-copper-2025-03-10/).

# MARCH 6th, 2025~The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals

[The Geopolitics of Critical Minerals – The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/the-geopolitics-of-critical-minerals/)

https://preview.redd.it/34e5isrrs1oe1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3837900f6d18552c2d3ecf0fcdabdb398222c222

Trans-Pacific View author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with Thijs Van de Graaf – associate professor at Ghent University, energy fellow at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics, and lead author of IRENA’s report on the geopolitics of critical materials (2023) – is the 451st in The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series.

**Explain the role and relevance of critical minerals in the global energy transition.**

The energy transition is, at its core, a materials transition. Batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles (EVs) rely on lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements – making clean technologies far more mineral-intensive than fossil fuel systems. An electric car, for example, requires six times more minerals than a conventional one, and an offshore wind farm needs nine times more minerals per megawatt than a gas plant.

But unlike fossil fuels, which must be constantly extracted and burned, minerals are a one-time input. Once mined, they can be used, reused, and recycled – shifting the security equation. The problem is not that we lack these materials, but that supply chains are fragile, refining is concentrated, and demand is rising faster than production can keep up.

**Examine the impact of China-U.S. geopolitical tensions on critical minerals supply chains.**

The China-U.S. rivalry is reshaping global supply chains for critical minerals. China dominates many aspects of the critical minerals supply chain, but it particularly controls refining and processing. While China only mines about 13 percent of global lithium resources, it refines over 60 percent of the world’s lithium. Similarly, it processes 85 percent of the world’s rare earths​. This dominance is not so much linked to resource endowment, but rather strategic industrial policy and capital investment over decades​.

In response, the U.S. is racing to reshape supply chains, incentivize domestic production, and deepen partnerships with resource-rich allies like Australia and Canada. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has kickstarted major investment, while China has retaliated with export controls on gallium and germanium – signaling that critical minerals are now a geopolitical bargaining chip.

The result is a fragmenting supply chain, with competing industrial blocs forming. But reshoring and diversification take time, and in the short term, bottlenecks, price volatility, and political risk will define the landscape.

**What other geopolitical risks are affecting developments in the critical minerals industry?**

Beyond China-U.S. tensions, mineral supply chains are becoming a new arena for geopolitical power struggles. I see three geopolitical risks.

Resource nationalism is surging. Indonesia has banned unprocessed nickel exports to build a domestic processing industry. Chile and Mexico are nationalizing lithium reserves, aiming to move up the value chain – from mining to battery production. The message is clear: mineral-rich countries no longer want to be just suppliers; they want a bigger cut of the profits.

Territorial disputes over mineral wealth are heating up. The Trump administration floated the idea of buying Greenland – rich in rare earths – and recently has begun insisting that Ukraine’s mineral deposits play a role in repaying U.S. military aid. In Africa, Rwanda-backed rebels are seizing key mining regions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Industrial policy is taking center stage. Governments are investing in battery recycling, alternative chemistries, and supply chain resilience. Sodium-ion and solid-state batteries could eventually reduce reliance on lithium and cobalt. But geopolitical urgency is pushing softer issues – like environmental impact and labor rights – off the agenda.

**Analyze the correlation between energy security and national security from the perspectives of Washington, Beijing, and other stakeholder countries.**

Energy security is no longer just about oil and gas. It’s about who controls the materials that power the clean energy economy.

For Washington, reliance on Chinese mineral refining is seen as a strategic vulnerability. The U.S. is doubling down on supply chain resilience through government intervention, incentives, and defense-linked investments.

For Beijing, mineral dominance is a lever of geopolitical influence. China has spent decades securing supply chains, investing in African mines, Latin American lithium, and strategic stockpiles. But China is also vulnerable – it is the world’s largest importer of raw nickel, copper, and lithium, meaning any disruption in its upstream supply could reverberate through its economy.

For Europe, Japan, and emerging economies, the challenge is navigating growing economic nationalism. The EU has launched its Critical Raw Materials Act to boost domestic refining, but with limited resources, it remains dependent on imports. Meanwhile, resource-rich countries like Indonesia and Chile are seizing the moment to extract better deals from global buyers.

The world is entering an era where access to minerals is as strategic as access to oil once was – but with a key difference: a lithium shortage won’t shut down your EV, but it might prevent new ones from being built. The security risks are real, but they play out over a different time horizon.

**Assess the market implications of China-U.S. strategic competition regarding China’s control over critical minerals.**

The China-U.S. competition over critical minerals is reshaping global markets, not just in trade but in industrial power. China dominates refining and processing, not because it has all the resources, but because it built the infrastructure. The West is now racing to catch up, but mining and refining take time, creating fragmentation, price volatility, and geopolitical leverage.

Yet true self-sufficiency is an illusion – China is also the largest importer of key raw materials. Supply chains are not linear but deeply interwoven. The real challenge is not just securing more minerals but rethinking supply itself: investing in recycling, new battery chemistries, and urban mining to break dependencies and build resilience.

Rather than a return to free-market dynamics, we are entering an era where industrial policy and geopolitical strategy dictate the future of critical minerals markets. Governments will continue to heavily intervene in supply chains, whether through subsidies, trade restrictions, or strategic partnerships.

# Ottawa unveils investments to bolster nation's energy security and reduce its reliance on authoritarian governments.

As trade disputes with the United States escalate and the demand for critical minerals continues to rise, the Canadian government steps up its efforts to leverage the nation's critical minerals advantage.

During a March 3 presentation at the 2025 Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto, Canada's Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson unveiled more than C$600 million ($415 million) in new funding and tax credits aimed to accelerate mining and enable the development and expansion of critical minerals in Canada.

""The investments and initiatives announced today will create good jobs for Canadian workers and businesses, support economic opportunities, bolster its energy security, reduce our reliance on authoritarian governments and contribute to a resilient and secure future,"" Wilkinson said.

This federal funding package includes two primary components: a tax credit to boost domestic mineral exploration investments and a C$500 million ($346 million) commitment to infrastructure in Canada's richest critical mineral regions.

""By investing big in critical minerals research and infrastructure development, we are not only accelerating our transition to a low-carbon economy but also securing generational economic opportunities for Canadians to take the lead in the global shift to net zero,"" said Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne.

[Canada's critical minerals list was assembled from the viewpoint of a mining powerhouse positioning itself as the global supplier of choice for the minerals and metals essential to modern living.](https://preview.redd.it/5y2oa171r1oe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2dad0031b7c5c87ce91205a82c4cdea072f3665f)

# Mineral Exploration Tax Credit

Canada's Mineral Exploration Tax Credit encourages Canadians to invest in Canada-based companies to explore for minerals and metals on Canadian soil.

Because junior mining companies typically do not turn a profit until they sell their mineral exploration projects or advance them into production, the money invested in exploration is considered a loss on financial balance sheets. The Canadian government developed a way to turn this loss into a financial gain for Canadian investors.

Canada's Income Tax Act allows Canadian companies to transfer mineral exploration expenses to individual investors through flow-through shares. For tax purposes, the mineral exploration expenses are considered to have been incurred by the investor, not the company, and can reduce the investor's taxable income.

Under the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, individual investors can claim a 15% tax credit for eligible mineral exploration expenses. Only Canadian companies can participate in flow-through financings, and all the investments that flow tax credits to Canadian investors have to be spent on projects in Canada.

There had been some concern that the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit would expire on its sunset date at the end of March. However, Wilkinson announced that the program will be extended for two years.

This extension is expected to generate C$110 million ($76 million) in new mineral exploration investments across Canada.

""With this proposed extension to the Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we continue to foster the sustainable development of Canada's natural resources, create well-paying jobs for Canadian workers in the mining sector and grow our economy,"" said Minister of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc.

# Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund

The Canadian government is also continuing to invest heavily in building the infrastructure needed to support critical mineral projects across the nation.

Launched in 2023, the C$1.5 billion ($1 billion) Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund is addressing the nation's infrastructure gaps to connect critical mineral projects to markets through clean energy, electrification, and transportation infrastructure projects.

From C$60 million ($41 million) to support [highway and hydroelectricity projects in British Columbia and the Yukon](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2024/09/27/news/ottawa-invests-60m-in-northern-bc-yukon/8720.html) to C$43.5 million ($34.5 million) to [fast-track Quebec's mining and mineral processing infrastructure](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/02/12/tech-metals/ottawa-boosts-quebecs-critical-minerals/2134.html), Canada's Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund has already conditionally approved over C$300 million ($207 million) to support more than 30 critical minerals infrastructure projects across the nation.

During his presentation at the PDAC convention, Wilkinson invited businesses and governments in Canada to apply for another $500 million ($346 million), which is now available under a second call for Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund proposals.

""Better infrastructure is key to Canada's critical minerals supply chain,"" said Minister of Transport and International Trade Anita Anand. ""With up to $500 million in new funding under the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund, we are accelerating mining and expanding critical mineral development, advancing clean energy and strengthening our economy.""

The expanded initiatives announced in Toronto support Canada's whole-of-government strategy to become a superpower when it comes to delivering the minerals and metals needed for high-tech and clean energy in the 21st century.

""With over $700 million in investments under the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy by the Government of Canada alone in the past two years, Canada's mining and critical minerals industry have successfully risen to the challenge of meeting the ever-increasing international demand for critical minerals,"" said Wilkinson.

# MARCH 3RD, 2025~ For Greenland’s Minerals, the Harsh Reality Behind the Glittering Promise

  
***There is excitement about the potentially lucrative resources scattered around the island, especially the rare earths. But extreme weather, fired-up environmentalists and other factors have tempered hopes of a bonanza.***

[Greenland’s Minerals: The Harsh Reality Behind the Glittering Promise - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/greenland-minerals-trump.html)

[Greenlanders have expressed caution about any new heavy industry. The island’s governing political party swept into office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and shut down one of the most promising mining projects.Credit...Ivor Prickett for The New York Times](https://preview.redd.it/k1do6b3nr1oe1.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=917ccd7463b65829c1831e78e4bf5e17b227563d)

More than a decade ago, Canadian miners prospecting for diamonds in western Greenland saw on the horizon a huge white hump.

They called it White Mountain and soon discovered it was a deposit of anorthosite, a salt-and-pepper color mineral used in paints, glass fibers, flame retardants and other industries. The same mineral creates a ghostly glow on the moon’s surface.

The White Mountain deposit proved to be several miles long and several miles wide, and “only God knows how deep it goes,” said Bent Olsvig Jensen, the managing director of Lumina Sustainable Materials, the company mining the area.

Lumina is backed by European and Canadian investors, but Mr. Jensen said it wasn’t easy to turn the deposit into a mountain of cash.

“You cannot do exploration all year round; you are in the Arctic,” he explained.

He told of fierce winds grounding helicopters and knocking out communications, pack ice blocking ships and temperatures dropping to such a dreadful low — sometimes minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit — that the hydraulic fluid powering the company’s digging machines “becomes like butter.”

Sitting in Lumina’s humble offices in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, with wet snow flakes scissoring down outside the windows, Mr. Jensen brought a dose of sobriety to all the talk of Greenland as the land of incalculable mineral riches. He noted that though the island has dozens of exploratory projects, there are only two active mines: his and a small gold operation.

The gigantic semiautonomous island in the Arctic has seized the world’s attention after President Trump insisted in January that the United States [take it over.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/world/europe/greenland-trump-denmark-security.html?searchResultPosition=5) Part of the attraction is its rare earths minerals that are vital to high-tech industries and a source of competition across the world.

Tech giants like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, along with [some of Mr. Trump’s allies](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/business/howard-lutnick-greenland.html), including Howard Lutnick, his commerce secretary, have invested in companies prospecting here. According to [a recent Danish study](https://data.geus.dk/gpub-landingpage/?id=32049), 31 of 34 materials defined as critical by the European Union, like lithium and titanium, are found on the island.

But for every square on the periodic table that Greenland can fill, there’s an even longer list of challenges.

Besides the extreme weather, the island has fewer than 100 miles of roads, only 56,000 residents (which means a tiny labor pool) and a few small ports.

Equally daunting for miners is Greenland’s environmentalist lobby. Many Greenlanders [say they need more mining](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/100000009937431/trump-wants-greenland-but-what-do-greenlanders-want.html?searchResultPosition=7) to become economically and politically independent of Denmark, which keeps it afloat with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual subsidies.

But Greenlanders have also expressed caution about any new heavy industry. They are protective of their environment, which is being shaken up by climate change: The Arctic is [warming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3) nearly four times as fast as the rest of the world, which will most likely make the mineral resources more accessible.

The island’s governing political party swept into office four years ago on an environmentalist platform and shut down one of the most promising mining projects. The next elections are on March 11, and, along with independence from Denmark and closer relations with the United States, safeguarding the environment is at the top of the agenda.

For many Greenlanders, nature is a part of their identity and something they connect to through fishing, hunting, hiking and spending time outdoors.

“We have lived with nature for as long as we have been here, in sustainable ways,” said Ellen Kristensen, an environmentalist in South Greenland.

Mining giant Rio Tinto (ASX, LON, NYSE: RIO) and UK refinery developer Green Lithium are partnering to establish an end-to-end lithium supply chain aimed at supporting the UK and EU’s automotive and manufacturing industries
....

....
Green Lithium’s ambitious plan to build and operate a large-scale lithium refinery in Teesside, England, is the backbone of the announced partnership. The facility will produce high-purity lithium chemicals for both the UK and EU markets, utilizing advanced technology designed for low-carbon, environmentally friendly processing of spodumene concentrate.
....

...
UK Industry and Decarbonization Minister Sarah Jones praised the partnership, emphasizing its potential to strengthen the local economy and the UK’s critical minerals supply chain. “It will not only support high-skilled jobs in the North East but boost our critical minerals supply chains as we continue to build a cleaner, greener future for our automotive industry and drive forward our mission to net zero,” Jones said.

635,1e1fen6,"I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket Post CPI. We saw rotation from MAg7 into IWM yesterday. here is how traders are positioned going forward, and some of the best plays to watch.

**IWM up again in premarket. Is at the 52w high resistance, after big breakout. Calls build on 215 and 220 in the positioning data. If we can hold this 211.88 52w high level, we head higher to 215+.**

[https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25](https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25) 

**Similarly Traders bet on return to 52w highs on TNA. Leveraged small caps so beware of that.**

[https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE](https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE) 

**I think the IWM, small cap buy case is strong. I was in from before CPI as I thought it was too bearish and would see squeeze. But I think CPI and unemployment data is now pointing to sept rate cut. I think Trump winning is bullish for Small caps too. I think there's reasons there for IWM to run**

**VIX: Slight spike yesterday, but traders are still V short volatility, with vix in contango. V much skewed to ITM puts. Traders will try to crush VIX again.**

[https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M](https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M) 

Dow Jones positioning also looks bullish, with my target at 40k.

**Rotation we saw yesterday is normal given soft inflation print, which makes chance of rate cuts more likely. Hence traders rotated from mag7 into interest rate sensitive IWM. But there's no panic in markets, credit default swaps plunged, hence conditions bullish Traders will buy back Mag7 too soon.**

Some MAG7 more bullish than others. MSFT&lt; AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL the most bullish. NVDA somewhat. TSLA less so, as we see traders take profits. Its normal though given they had the robotaxi news, not just rotation. 

GOLD AND OIL POSITIONING ARE BULLISH AFTER CPI. 



DATA LEDE:

CHINA BALANCE OF TRADE data showed stronger than expected exports, up 8.6% vs 8% expected. Stronger global demand. 

However, still weak domestic demand, as imports fell -2.3% vs 2.8% expected.

Trade surplus highest since 1990

German wholesale prices come in at -0.3% MOM vs 0.2% expected. 

US PPI coming premarket.

US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Numbers and Inflation expectation numbers after market opens. 



YESTERDAY CPI REVIEW: Overall a v bullish CPI print, which supports September cut imo. This coupled with labour market data means Fed shouldn’t hesitate to cut rates. 

Lowest Y/Y CPI print since March 2021

First M/M decrease since May 2020. Down -0.1% vs expectation of 0.1% increase. 

Shelter component had smallest increase since Aug 2021

We saw a big fall in airline fares, down 5%, and we saw a big drop in used car prices. 

The drop in airline fares was corroborated by Delta airline earnings. 



MARKETS:

WE SAW PROFIT TAKING ON SPX AND NASDAQ YESTERDAY AS TRADERS ROTATED INTO SMALL CAPS WHICH HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. 

SPX sold off form 5640 to 5577, before recovering slightly. Is currently trading at 5592. Just lost the gains from Wednesdays move. 

NASDAQ: Bigger sell off, as is more heavily weighted to the Mag7, which saw the most selling. Dropped from 20,700 to 20200. Flat here. 

Dow Jones: Moving higher, confirmed breakout, moved up to 39,800. Next target looks like 40k

GER40: European markets higher after soft CPI yesterday. 

Chinese market higher from the added restrictions on short selling which is an artificial support of the HKG market, also following US CPI hence supporting lower rates in US which helps chinese exports. 

Nikkei drops after hitting ATH earlier in the week. 

GOLD moving higher above 2400 after soft CPI

Oil recovering, positioning improving after Dollar weakness from CPI lead to recovery. 

VIX - jumped yesterday, but traders still v short on vix, hence we probably see sell off again. 



EARNINGS:

  
JPM 

EPS of 4.4 vs estimate of 4.28.

Adjusted revenue of 50.99B vs 50.21B estimate.

637,1g1v4q0,Advice for moving from FIFO engineering to a city engineering job,Valuable-Stick7745,/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1g1v4q0/advice_for_moving_from_fifo_engineering_to_a_city/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1g1v4q0/advice_for_moving_from_fifo_engineering_to_a_city/,5,9,1728719170.0,"Hi all,

Just for some background: I’m a 25-year-old mechanical engineer working FIFO as a mechanical maintenance engineer for Rio Tinto. I live in Perth, Western Australia, and fly to the Pilbara on an 8:6 roster.

My day-to-day focuses on maintaining assets such as crushers, vibrating screens, conveyors, stackers, reclaimers, ship loaders, and more. The main goal of my role is to get assets running again after a major breakdown or when they aren’t operating as designed. This involves a lot of quick thinking and problem-solving under time pressure. When there are no breakdowns, my work shifts to defect elimination (DE) projects aimed at improving the reliability, safety, or ergonomics of the equipment. These projects often result from investigations into past breakdowns or plant inefficiencies.

However, since I work for the client, much of the detailed design engineering for these DE projects is outsourced to external consultancies specializing in specific equipment or processes. For example, these consultancies might perform FEA analyses or redesign hydraulic circuits. My role, on the other hand, involves coming up with the initial concept and scope, overseeing the design to ensure it meets Australian standards and company guidelines, and confirming that it works practically without introducing safety or ergonomic issues for the teams working on the equipment.

Now to my concern:
My goal is to return to a city-based role after 3-5 years in my current job (I’m currently one year in). However, I realize that I won’t have the same level of technical design experience as many engineers working in consultancies, which is a bit concerning. That said, I don’t really want to move into a design-focused role—I love what I do now, which involves broader engineering responsibilities, managing people, and working through breakdowns. My preference would be to transition into a project engineering role or a position that values the skills I’ll develop on-site.

So, my question is:
Is it realistic to secure a city-based engineering job coming from my current role? Any advice or insights from people who’ve made similar transitions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.682311,2024-10-12T18:46:10,Rio Tinto,2024

**Virus update -**

**Infection rates have risen sharply in South Kore**a in the past 24 hours with [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/](http://archive.is/6xK89) now saying there are 1,765 cases reported there - that's a jump of 10%.  In the past 3 minutes since I have been typing, a BBC news flash via their app says the UK has identified another 2 cases (bring our total to 15, one has been in Italy, the other in Tenerife) whilst select other countries include Italy (470), Japan (207), Iran (141) and  Kuwait (43) at time of typing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Saudi Arabia has banned entry for pilgrims** to perform Umrah in Mecca or visit the Prophets mosque in Medina as well as all entry from countries with significant outbreaks according to media based in the country.   [Link](http://archive.is/dpB7l).  There are no reports yet as to whether the Hajj at the end of July will go ahead (*Note from me: I've been looking for news on the topic for a few days now and not noticed anything yet*).

&amp;#x200B;

**US government response** \- The US president Donald Trump has appointed VP Mike Pence to lead the US government's management and response to the virus.  He views the risk as ""very low"" and doesn't think a spread in the US is inevitable (unlike his health experts who do) says the Guardian in today's live blog (6:58am UK time stamp, [link](http://archive.is/wip/XlcUu))

&amp;#x200B;

**Major stock markets continue to drop -** The twitter handle Investingcom (which I can't link to) says that multiple stock markets in Europe are already down over 2% this morning whilst US futures indicate a drop of (at time of writing) 1.4% when they open in a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**Supply chain specific news**

&amp;#x200B;

**US Pharma supply chain sustainability** \-  The Washington Post has run a story ([Link](http://archive.is/vwSMM)) reporting that for the US it's not possible to identify where drugs come from or even how much is being imported.  Pharma companies tend to buy active pharmaceutical ingredients (API)  in bulk it explains, adding that this isn't tracked.  “We cannot determine with any precision the volume of API that China is actually producing, or the volume … entering the U.S. market,” Janet Woodcock, director of FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research told Congress last autumn/fall [Link](http://archive.is/wip/DXQzi).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Major shortage of masks in US hospitals are likely soon** \- HMFA (the US Hospital Management and Financial Association) is reporting ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/hsvb1)) that most hospitals are experiencing delays of three to five days on orders of N95 respirators because the majority of the manufactured masks are needed in the country of manufacture; this means there isn't much surplus available to ship to meet US demand.  On Feb. 26, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told the House Appropriations Committee that the country has a stockpile of 12 million N95 masks, but according to HHS estimates, it needs 300 million to cover an emergency. The article adds that the maximum annual production capacity in the U. S. and Mexico is 65 million (*Note from me: I couldn't find any information whether this can be ramped up further).*  

&amp;#x200B;

 **Uniserve predicts return to normality in China by beginning of March** \-  in its latest blog post on its website ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/H8uB4)) it says the situation is stabilising and that production will return to 98% by week 11 but that transport restrictions will be lifted slower that factories .   Airfreight capacity is at 50% whilst trucking is at 40% (personal note: this is an improvement, two weeks ago it was around 10%).   Supply chains are likely to be disrupted until at least April.   It warns of new threats in Europe if outbreaks develop there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Surcharges introduced due to virus disruption** \- Supply chain giant DB Schenker announces Corona Impact surcharges on exports to the far East, India and Middle East and for LCL (Less than full Container Load) from March 1st.  [Link to their website announcement](http://archive.is/wip/mFOfu).

&amp;#x200B;

**Air cargo likely to surge in demand** \- Atlas air (a large cargo airline) expects a surge in demand from China over the coming weeks according to its chairman and CEO adding that the group was getting a “lot of calls from some very experienced and knowledgeable shippers, freight forwarders and brokers” ([Air Cargo World Link](http://archive.is/wip/cY74T)).  The company has been taking volunteers to fly in and out of China and implemented some programs including premium pay to do so.  He expects the demand to remain even when the commercial belly capacity (passenger planes) return to the market due to a huge amount of demand.  *Note from me: For now the cargo only carriers have the market almost entirely to themselves due to passenger flight suspensions but all airports except for Wuhan are reported as operating normally for cargo freight.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Seafreight: Inactive container tonnage hits a new record** \- Splash247.com reports ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/DE7uW)) that 2.04m teu (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit, the unit of measure in container shipping) are not being used at present.  This beats the previous high of 1.59m when Hanjin shipping collapsed as well as the 1.52m teu level at the height of the global financial crisis.  They report that a shortage of truck drivers remains whilst the PRC's ports still have more than twice the recent average of containers waiting to be unloaded.

&amp;#x200B;

**Australian consumers starting to experience hygiene product shortages** \- Supermarket chain Coles says in a Yahoo Finance report ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/FKrwk)) it's running low on hand sanitiser and hand wash products with shortages expected for other non food related products such as stationery, clothing and electrical goods.  It is also keeping an eye on the availability of local based suppliers who source raw materials or packaging from China.  Rival chain Woolworths is also reporting high demand for hand sanitiser.  *Note from me: the same might be happening in the UK, I decided to get some hand sanitiser and Boots (a major drug store here and the obvious go to) seems to be sold out via its website.  In the end I used a b2b supplier who happily sold it to me as a b2c consumer and will ship to my home address.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Australian companies beginning to experience other shortages too** \- Business Insider reports  ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/je583)) that Unleashed (a supply chain software company) says that some customers either can't get deliveries or are only getting partial deliveries.  With infections continuing to rise in Japan and South Korea, more areas may be put underneath restrictions next month, exacerbating the disruption.  Price rises may rise and in some cases may have to be passed on to the consumer.  A finance portfolio manager is also quoted in the article, saying that short term disruption is manageable for the next month or two but after that component part inflation and availability issues may increase.  He adds that SARS is not a relevant benchmark because it was less contagious, had a shorter incubation period and was quicker to recover from, and adds that the (stock) market has been complacent so far in pricing in adverse outcomes.  *Personal note: If that's the case, expect global stock markets to fall further as a result.*  Continuing the article, it adds that Treasury Wine Estates (which sells much of its wine to China) has experienced significant drops in demand whilst various retail and tourism related firms are also experiencing significant drops in share prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question marks over whether the new iPhone will roll out on time** \- Reuters reports ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/lkqar)) that this is the time of year when Apple engineers fly out to Asia to fine tune manufacturing face to face in March through to May before production ramps up in June.  There is a problem; they're not travelling.  A former Apple engineer identifies that it's hard to do the necessary engineering collaboration if you're not working face to face, a view echoed by an executive in a semi conductor firm that supplies smartphone companies.  ""You're really talking about two lost months, which in the consumer electronics cycle is huge.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Profit warning from Microsoft** \- Microsoft has warned it no longer expects to hit it's Q3 earnings for its ""More Personal Computing"" division due to supply chain impacts from the virus.   Its Q3 ends March 31st and the divison's activities include windows, Surface, accessories and gaming plus MSN advertising.  [CNBC Link](http://archive.is/wip/KXKzN)

&amp;#x200B;

**Another warning from LOL Surprise! Doll maker MGA Entertainment** \- There's been several articles due to their (rather vocal) senior execs that I've recently highlighted and this is another - the founder has told Yahoo Finance ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/qxJdU)) that this is the worst disruption he's ever seen.  Already one of his most popular toys will be delayed by seven weeks because production has dropped by 60% compared to last year meaning the company will miss Easter.  Already he is worried about being able to catch up for the all important autumn season.  The company depends on China for nearly 90% of its production and whilst workers are returning to factories, raw material shortages remain a major problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**No problem with toy manufacturing says Xinhua** \- The Chinese state news agency carries a report ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/sC3fi)) contradicting MGA Entertainment above suggesting that Chinese toy manufacturing is not experiencing difficulties.  It quotes the VP of product development at University Games as saying "" The Chinese government and the factories are doing a great job, really planning ahead and making sure that they get ahead of the virus, so that we're ready to continue our operations just as soon as everything is clear"".  *Personal note: The article is somewhat ruined because the examples Xinhua has cited are all companies with annual revenues under $10m USD (according to a quick internet check) whilst MGA Entertainment's revenue last year was $9.6 billion USD.

Georgia port (a major US Seaport) expects a hit to the local economy - AJC (A Georgia based news outlet) says ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/7amSI)) that the state's economy is likely to start taking economic impacts very soon with shipments into the state's ports dropping up to 40% in March and April.  Cuts and closures in China have not yet evidenced themselves in Georgia because sailing time is 30 days.  About 440,000 jobs (roughly 1 in 9) jobs is dependent on the ports and the commerce that moves through them with half of those jobs based in metro Atlanta.  Jobs are likely to be threatened if the problems persist for more than a few months the executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority said.  *Personal note: expect major European seaports to report the same in a week or two as their time lag is even longer than Georgia's.*

**Electrical equipment and data centre infrastructure giant Schneider Electric** affected - the company says ([link](http://archive.is/wip/k1G55)) its Q1 revenues could be down as much as €300m (approx $326m USD) due to factory closures in China halting production.  Techerati reports that 80% of the factories have now reopened (Personal note: it doesn't say how operational they are which is really important).  The CEO expects to make up the losses by the end of the year.  The data centre industry as viewed in the article as being fairly shock resistant as they have piles of inventory and can cope until at least March.  Nevertheless, some large tech firms are experiencing share price falls whilst one analyst from IDC thinks the worst is still ahead for the industry.

**Stock out threats to small-scale Amazon sellers who use China factories** \- the WSJ reports ([link](http://archive.is/fjfcW)) that Amazon's ranking algorithm heavily penalises products that are out of stock meaning they appear lower in searches.  To avoid this, sellers are rising prices to avoid stock outs whilst attempting to shift production to other countries.  One Michigan based seller of kitchen products said that he doesn't think the Amazon platform has ever ""seen such a massive amount of inventory problems as we are about to see"", adding a supplier in Southern China has warned him that even if the local government lets them reopen, they will be short staffed for weeks whilst workers from other provinces self quarantine.  Already the kitchen seller is out of two products and his rankings are dropping on Amazon as a result.  Amazon is said to be working with suppliers to secure additional inventory plus given advice on how to protect the health of accounts on the platform.  The article goes on to give several examples where many sellers will begin to run out of products by early to mid March.  It adds that other sellers are already beginning to worry about stockpiling enough Christmas inventory due to the long lead times involved.

**Africa e-commerce is also beginning to be impacted** \- QZ reports ([Link](http://archive.is/wip/n9F8a)) that Jumia (the rapidly growing Amazon of Africa) has said in its Q4 earnings report that immediate growth prospects may be impacted by the Coronavirus outbreak.  Its CEO clarified that they are starting to face issues with fulfilling cross border sales and many of its sellers (like Amazon above) are starting to face procurement issues which is affecting both availability and prices.

**Indian steel industry woes** \- Business Standard (a major English language business newspaper in India) says ([link](http://archive.is/wip/OPFyd)) that continued weak demand due to the virus is expected to keep domestic steel prices under pressure. China's domestic hot-rolled coil prices have dropped to 39,000 rupees in recent days although a price rise of 500-750 rupees per tonne is expected from March 1 due to global coking coal prices (a key ingredient) rising due to difficulties in shipping it out of China.  Iron ore prices have also dropped due a decline of imports from China due to the virus causing global prices to drop from $125 per tonne to $83 a tonne.

Their first patient was recorded on Jan 23 and they currently are reported as having 93.  The situation is not helped by a mandatory 14 day quarantine for arrivals with travel history to China whilst there's been a sharp rise in Indian and Bangladeshi workers requesting to return to their home country.

TORONTO, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Goliath Resources Limited (TSX-V: GOT) (OTCQB: GOTRF) (FSE: B4IF)** (the **“Company”** or **“Goliath”** ) is pleased to announce that an agreement has been made for **McEwen Mining Inc. (NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX)** to make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources.

**Strategic Investment Highlights**

* Post transaction, McEwen Mining will own 3.76% of the issued and outstanding shares of Goliath Resources.
* McEwen Mining will pay in McEwen Mining shares worth C$10 million based on the closing price of McEwen Mining and Goliath Resources on January 28, 2025.
* McEwen Mining will receive a half warrant, exercisable at C$2.50 for 12 months.
* Goliath Resources will own 868,056 shares of McEwen Mining.

**Roger Rosmus, Founder and CEO of Goliath Resources, states:** *“We are delighted to have McEwen Mining make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources. Rob McEwen recognized the potential of our Surebet high-grade gold discovery in 2023, and has made three personal investments through private placements since then. Our 2024 drilling campaign was a major breakthrough season for the Surebet high-grade gold discovery in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. The discovery is noted for having a series of stacked gently dipping veins with widespread high-grade gold. It is fortunate to have a remarkable content of visible gold which is in all the rock units (sediments, contact of the sediments and volcanics, and in the volcanics, as well as in the intrusion related dykes) with abundant fine-grained visible gold, including coarse-grained visible gold. In our 2023 drilling, we found visible gold in 32% of the drill holes and in 2024 that increased to 92%. Our recently reported drill hole intersection was our best to date returning 10 meters of 132.93 g/t gold equivalent (plus several high-grade holes with multiple intercepts, system remains wide open) making for a gram/meter intersection that puts it in the top percentile of all intersections throughout the world in the past 20 years. Each season we have seen the discovery get better and saw several pleasant surprises in 2024, including the high percentage of visible gold in our deeper drilling into the system, and our remarkable recently reported intersection. We still have 89 pending holes from the 2024 drilling season to report and think we may have made a second important discovery, this one a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) 35 km to the north of Surebet. Rob* *McEwen* *is a member of the Order of Canada and a Canadian Mining Hall of Fame member due to his record of philanthropy and* *the tremendous success he had building Goldcorp from a small gold miner to a success story when Goldcorp mined its bonanza-zone at their Red Lake Mine, making it one of the lowest cost miners of high-grade gold in the gold mining sector. His recognition of the success of the Surebet discovery in 2023 has been greatly appreciated and we are pleased to have McEwen Mining join our shareholder roster with this strategic investment. We are also very pleased that Goliath Resources will be a significant shareholder of McEwen Mining due to their combination of being a gold miner, their extensive drilling on their gold projects and their world-class copper asset that is in the top 10 undeveloped copper projects ranking in the lowest cost quartile as well.”*

**Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner of McEwen Mining, states:** “ *The Goliath Resources team has done a terrific job advancing their Surebet high-grade gold discovery in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia and McEwen Mining is thrilled to make a strategic investment into Goliath Resources. What initially caught my attention was the high-grade gold they discovered, and that it was a grassroots discovery in the Golden Triangle which is a prolific gold mining jurisdiction, one of the most important in Canada. Worldwide, grassroots discoveries of high-grade gold in a mining-friendly jurisdiction well-known for high-grade gold mines are exceedingly rare. They were able to make the grassroots discovery due to it until fairly recently being covered by glaciers and permanent snowpack that have receded to expose a large area of outcropping rock that has now been significantly advanced over the past few drilling seasons. McEwen Mining is committed to gold mining, our gold mines are benefitting from the record high prices of gold in 2024 and we have an updated resource coming out in the first quarter of 2025 on our Fox Complex, where we also have a 69,500 meter (budgeted for $9.7 million) drilling campaign underway. We are also moving our Los Azules copper development project toward a feasibility study in the first half of 2025 and are contemplating taking McEwen Copper public after the feasibility study is published* *(McEwen Mining owns 46.4% of McEwen Copper, Stellantis owns 18.3%, Nuton is a Rio Tinto venture that owns 17.2% and Rob McEwen owns 12.7% of McEwen Copper). I believe strongly that the future is very bright for both copper and gold, and that McEwen Mining is well positioned for significant growth potential in those metals with our assets. We look forward to seeing the pending assays from Goliath Resources’ Surebet discovery and their new VMS discovery and we are pleased to be enthusiastic shareholders of Goliath with this strategic investment.”*

**Golddigger Property**

The Golddigger Property is 100% controlled and covers an area of 91,518 hectares in the world-class geological setting of the Eskay Rift, within 3 kilometers of the Red Line in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. This area has hosted some of Canada’s greatest mines including Eskay Creek, Premier and Snip. Other significant and well-known deposits in the Golden Triangle include Brucejack, Copper Canyon, Galore Creek, Granduc, KSM, Red Chris, and Schaft Creek. Goliath controls 56 kilometers of the Red Line which is a geologic contact between Triassic age Stuhini rocks and Jurassic age Hazelton rocks used as key markers when exploring for gold-copper-silver mineralization.

The Surebet discovery has exceptional continuity and excellent metallurgy with gold recoveries of 92.2%, with 48.8% of it as free gold from gravity alone at a 327-micrometer crush (no cyanide required to recover the gold). The metallurgy completed to date shows no deleterious elements are present such as mercury or arsenic.

The Property is in an excellent location in close proximity to the communities of Alice Arm and Kitsault where there is a permitted mill site on private property. It is situated on tide water with direct barge access to Prince Rupert (190 kilometers via the Observatory inlet/Portland inlet). The town of Kitsault is accessible by road (190 kilometers from Terrace, 300 kilometers from Prince Rupert) and has a barge landing, dock, and infrastructure capable of housing at least 300 people, including high-tension power.

Additional infrastructure in the area includes the Dolly Varden Silver Mine Road (only 7 kilometers to the East of the Surebet discovery) with direct road access to Alice Arm barge landing (18 kilometers to the south of the Surebet discovery) and high-tension power (25 kilometers to the east of Surebet discovery). The city of Terrace (population 16,000) provides access to railway, major highways, and airport with supplies (food, fuel, lumber, etc.), while the town of Prince Rupert (population 12,000) is located on the west coast and houses an international container seaport also with direct access to railway and an airport.

[U.S. Moves Big on Critical Minerals - NAI 500](https://nai500.com/blog/2024/11/u-s-moves-big-on-critical-minerals/)

https://preview.redd.it/cprmbr7i3g7e1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60f44cdfbb30c85aa831f7ecf8837a3f4cd836e3

# Last Friday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 8446, the Critical Mineral Consistency Act, with a vote of 245 to 155. This bill amends the Energy Act of 2020 by expanding the definition of critical minerals to incorporate the Department of Energy’s (DOE) list of critical materials into the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) list of critical minerals.

  
[H.R.8446 - 118th Congress (2023-2024): Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8446?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22H.r.+8446%22%7D&amp;s=4&amp;r=2)

***The legislation has garnered bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats.***

The concept of critical minerals has been emphasized by developed Western nations like the U.S. and the EU. Against the backdrop of increasing localization and regionalization in the mining industry, Western countries view resource security as a key component of national and economic security. The U.S. began establishing a critical minerals list in 2018.

# According to the U.S. Energy Act, the DOE’s list includes materials essential for clean energy technology, criteria focused on U.S. economic and national security, significant supply chain risks, and fundamental roles in product manufacturing. Compared to the USGS list, the DOE’s list covers more areas, including materials like copper, ELECTRICAL STEEL, fluorine, silicon, and silicon carbide, which are critical materials but not classified as critical minerals.

  
By broadening the definition, the new bill mandates that the USGS include materials from the DOE’s list within 45 days of their addition to the DOE’s critical materials list. This legislation will next proceed to the Senate for approval.

Juan Ciscomani, an Arizona representative and the bill’s sponsor, stated that critical minerals are vital for the U.S. economy, national security, and clean energy technologies. With increasing demand for these strategic resources, the U.S. must ensure a reliable supply. The bill aims to eliminate discrepancies between the USGS and DOE lists and strengthen the domestic supply chain by including copper, electrical steel, silicon, and silicon carbide in the critical minerals list.

Adam Estelle, CEO of the Copper Development Association, noted that this vote highlights copper’s crucial role in driving America’s energy future, transportation electrification, job creation, and infrastructure enhancement, marking a significant victory for U.S. manufacturing, the clean energy transition, and national global competitiveness.

The bill promotes the standardization of criteria for identifying critical minerals and aims to reduce reliance on foreign imports by encouraging domestic mining, refining, and recycling. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) stated that if the bill becomes law, critical mineral projects, including copper projects, would qualify for the FAST-41 permitting process, making approvals more efficient, predictable, and timely.

# *****NIOBIUM'S ROLE IN ELECTRICAL STEEL***

# Niobium (Nb) is a transition metal that is often used as an alloying element in the production of electrical steels, particularly in the manufacture of high-performance steels for electrical applications. The key uses of niobium in electrical steel are as follows:

# 1. Improving Magnetic Properties

Niobium is used to improve the magnetic properties of electrical steels, especially the **core loss** and **magnetic permeability**. When niobium is added to electrical steel, it enhances the material's ability to carry alternating current with minimal energy loss. This is crucial for applications in transformers, motors, and other electrical devices, where energy efficiency is paramount.

# 2. Enhancing Strength and Ductility

Niobium enhances the **strength** and **ductility** of electrical steel. By adding niobium to the steel, the grain structure is refined, which improves the mechanical properties of the steel. This results in better formability, allowing for thinner sheets, which is especially important for reducing the size of components like transformer cores and electrical motor laminations.

# 3. Grain Refinement

Niobium acts as a **grain refiner** in the production of electrical steel. It promotes the formation of fine, uniformly distributed grains, which improves the steel's **magnetic performance**. Smaller grains lead to reduced energy losses (core loss) when the material is exposed to alternating magnetic fields.

# 4. Reducing Core Loss

Niobium can significantly reduce **core loss**, a critical factor in transformer efficiency. By enhancing the material's microstructure, niobium helps reduce hysteresis and eddy current losses, which are common in electrical steel used for transformer cores and electric motor laminations.

# 5. Improving High-Temperature Stability

Niobium improves the **high-temperature stability** of electrical steels. This is beneficial for applications where the material may be exposed to high operational temperatures, such as in certain industrial motors and high-power transformers. Niobium's presence helps prevent the degradation of magnetic properties at elevated temperatures.

# 6. Better Performance in Laminated Sheets

Electrical steels are often produced in **laminated sheets** to reduce energy losses. The addition of niobium contributes to the **interlaminar insulation** and improves the overall performance of the laminated sheets, especially in high-frequency applications.

# 7. Improving the Surface Finish

Niobium can also help achieve a better **surface finish** in electrical steels, which is important for minimizing losses and improving the electrical efficiency of the components.

# Common Applications of Niobium-Alloyed Electrical Steels:

* **Transformers:** Niobium helps improve transformer efficiency by reducing core losses.
* **Electric Motors:** It is used in motor laminations to enhance efficiency.
* **Generators:** Niobium-alloyed steels are used in the production of generator cores.
* **Inductors and Chokes:** These components benefit from the improved magnetic properties of niobium-steels.

# In summary, Niobium plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of electrical steels, particularly by improving their magnetic properties, strength, ductility, and overall efficiency in electrical applications. Its ability to refine grain structure and reduce energy losses makes it an essential alloying element for high-performance electrical steel used in transformers, motors, and other electrical devices.

# OLDIE BUT GOODIE IF YA HAVEN'T SEEN IT AUGUST 2024 OPINION ~Space Saga Continues: Scandium +

  
[Space Saga Continues: Scandium + - MMTA](https://mmta.co.uk/space-saga-continues-scandium/)

# Scandium

In my last missive, I had a quick look at some of the challenges that have successfully to be met by metals when they are used “in space”. And, prior to that, at a couple of specific metals: beryllium and gallium. I shall, now, turn my attention to scandium, especially in aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) alloys, and why it may be used effectively in the space industry.^(1)

**SBIR**

A good a place to start, both interesting and fun, is with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme here in the US which encourages “…domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/ R&amp;D) with the potential for commercialization.”

Perhaps indicative of the growing recognition of scandium’s (and Al-Sc’s) potential, SBIR (Department of Defense (DoD)/ Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)) recently (on June 12) closed a “solicitation” entitled “Advancing Scandium Use in Metal Alloys for U.S. Weapon System Production and Sustainment” ^(2). To quote further from the solicitation:

“Potential DoD applications for Al-Sc alloy include the production and sustainment of *missiles*, aircraft, *space launch vehicles, satellites*, solider systems, military ground vehicles, marine applications, and other weapon systems (e.g., small arms and artillery).”^(3) (*italics mine*)

If you think back to some of the challenges faced by “metals in space”, with the characteristics and properties they have, scandium and Al-Sc look pretty useful contenders. As the solicitation states:

“Scandium can impart high strength properties to Al alloys which allows for reduced weight designs (compared to traditional Al alloy) and components for a wide range of defense platforms and other military items. Al-Sc alloys exhibit increased resistance to high temperature and corrosion when compared to common Al alloys. Of further interest, is the high weldability of Al-Sc alloy. Alloys with high weldability can reduce manufacturing labor and other costs associated with joining components and structures. Al-Sc alloy can be especially useful when used as a powder or wire in additive manufacturing.”^(4)

(I should, however, note that Al-Sc alloys are not new. They have been around a long time now. First recognized in the 1950s^(5), they were developed by scientists in the former USSR, not least for aerospace usage. And, having been used in the MiG 21 and MiG-29, continue, I believe, to be used in some Russian MiG fighters.)

**Additive Manufacturing**

Whilst the solicitation details quite a number of areas in which the DoD/DLA are particularly interested, for me the one that stands out especially is “additive manufacturing”. As a layperson, simplistically, for me, this last falls under the descriptor “3D printing”.

Some six years ago now, reports were being published about collaborative work done by Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics with the Fraunhofer ILT to “3D print a high-performance scandium/aluminum alloy (Al-Mg-Sc-Zr) using selective laser melting (SLM) technology”.^(6) A couple of years later 3D printing was again mentioned, in the context of SpaceX Crew Dragon.^(7)

A couple of months after this mention of SpaceX, Relativity Space, a Los Angeles-based private American aerospace manufacturing company and Australian metals recovery and industrial water treatment company Clean TeQ (developer of Al-Sc alloys and owner and operator of one of the most significant and highest-grade accumulations of scandium ever discovered), announced that they were teaming up to develop Al-Sc alloys for the 3D printing of launchers for commercial orbital launch services.^(8)

One of the results of their collaboration was the production of the 110 foot tall Terran 1 3D printed (with Al-Sc alloy) launch rocket — for the massive sum of $12 million.^(9) The first and only Terran 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral on March 23, 2023. Unfortunately, it was not a success, with the second stage failing to ignite.

However, while its launch may have been a failure, taking its performance as, essentially, demonstrating “proof of concept”, Terran 1 was subsequently “retired” and, since then,

Relativity Space has been working on Terran R, a medium-to-heavy lift reusable rocket, also 3D printed.10 Starting in 2026, will also launch from Cape Canaveral.

More recently, and with both more depth and greater focus on Al-Sc alloys specifically, there was an excellent piece in this year’s spring edition (Vol 10. No. 1) of Metal Additive Manufacturing, the magazine for the metal additive manufacturing industry, entitled “Scandium’s impact on the Additive Manufacturing of aluminium alloys.”^(11)

Pointing out that, in additive manufacturing (AM), “\[u\]nlike other manufacturing processes, weight is time in AM – and time is money; raw material costs take a back seat when it comes to overall part cost.” (Important, I believe, when it comes to scandium.)

The result, the authors (Jonathan Meyer and James E Barnes) believe, is that “\[i\]t is time to embrace the future with AM and scandium. AM enables using ‘premium’ materials and promotes lighter designs. Using less raw material and enabling lighter designs are inherently sustainable. The industry needs a high-strength aluminium alloy to improve the business case of using AM and aluminium.” And that they have made the case that either scarcity or supply chain issues are increasingly being resolved and, in any case, very little scandium is required to begin making an impact.“^(12)

This last should provide the DoD/DLA with at least a modicum of comfort when you consider that current supply of both scandium metals and scandium compounds is, essentially, controlled pretty much by China and Russia. (That said, in addition to developing operations in Canada, there are plans for the mining of scandium ore in the US.)

And, indeed, to round things off on both the 3-D printing and scandium production fronts, on June 13, Scandium Canada, which operates the Crater Lake project in northeastern Quebec “one of the few primary scandium deposits globally”, announced that, having worked with McMaster University on the 3D-prining of aluminium scandium powders for part production, it had now resolved some problems around solidification cracking and was looking at patent applications.^(13)

With its weight, strength and 3D “printability” advantages scandium and in particular, Al-Sc alloys have, I believe, considerable potential in the space saga. And, it would appear, even if it is, currently, not available to we here in the US in significant quantities, this may not pose insurmountable challenges. Whether or not it gets used extensively in a military context, with concerns about cost always to the fore in anything to do with space, going forward I believe we’ll see more about its use in aerospace and especially space.

# Three-Phase Commercialization Program

**NioCorp and Nanoscale are pursuing a three-phased development plan for commercial production of AlSc master alloy.  The goal of this program is to achieve full-scale AlSc master alloy production at approximately the same time as the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the “Elk Creek Project”) achieves commercial operation and planned production of approximately 100 tonnes per year of scandium oxide.**

1. ***Pilot scale batch production of 10 kilogram master alloy ingots***\*\*. Master alloy produced will be fully analyzed (metals and gases) at independent test facilities.  Ingot samples will be available for third-party examination and prospective customer testing / sampling.\*\*
2. ***Commercial demonstration production of 100 kg ingots***\*\*. NioCorp expects to perform this work at a third-party ingot casting facility, which is expected to significantly reduce development timelines and cost as well as leverage existing facility permits and operator experience.  The objective of this stage will be to optimize the production process and operating conditions.\*\*
3. ***Full scale commercial production of master alloy***\*\*. Assuming successful results at the pilot scale and commercial demonstration stages, and once project financing is obtained, NioCorp intends to secure an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction contractor to construct, start up, and commission a full-scale production facility with the capacity to consume up to the Elk Creek Project’s projected scandium production of approximately 100 tonnes (Sc metal contained in master alloy) per year.  NioCorp intends to co-locate the full-scale production facility with the Elk Creek Project in Nebraska in order to take advantage of the infrastructure (i.e., low-cost power, water, and natural gas) that will be in place for mining operations.\*\*

Trump Pledges to Accelerate Approvals for Projects Worth $1 Billion or More
The president-elect’s vow to expedite permits and trim environmental reviews addresses key obstacles in boosting energy and mining investments.

By John Haughey
12/11/2024

President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 10 pledged to expedite permitting and trim environmental reviews for investors financing large-scale job-creating and power-generating projects.
“Any person or company investing One Billion Dollars, Or More, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals. Get Ready to Rock!!!” Trump wrote in a mid-afternoon post on Truth Social.
The president-elect did not quantify if he had specific industries in mind in offering expedited “approvals and permits” for $1 billion-plus projects, but permitting reform has been a theme in Congress over the past two years, especially for energy and mining proposals.

Among measures that could be adopted before the lame-duck Congress adjourns on Dec. 19 is the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, adopted by the Senate Natural Resources Committee in July without further advance.
The measure, co-sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (I-W. Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), streamlines permitting and restricts litigation timelines, among other initiatives.
With a Republican trifecta assuming the mantle in Washington in January, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the landmark 1970 law that requires federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews before approving large-scale development and energy projects, is near certain to be revamped.


According to a 2020 White House Council on Environmental Quality study, securing final NEPA environmental permits for a project takes an average of 4 1/2 years; for electrical transmission projects, it takes an average of 6 1/2 years.
Those timelines stretch into decades when it comes to mining proposals.


“Right now, it takes anywhere to 10 to 30 years to build a mine, which is why we don’t have a mining industry in America,” Critical Minerals Institute Director Melissa Sanderson told The Epoch Times, citing “permitting absurdities” as one of the biggest hurdles that startups must overcome in getting projects started and sustaining them before they can get ores, minerals, and fossil fuels to market.
Sanderson, a board member with Australia-based American Rare Earths, which is developing several mining projects in Wyoming and Arizona, said slashing permitting timelines and environmental reviews is not merely an economic issue but a matter of national security with China dominating the production and processing of critical minerals needed for semi-conductors and weapons systems.
“The government needs to consolidate all of its department [reviews] so the company can present one, and only one, application” when proposing a project, Sanderson said.
Right now, if a company wants to build a mine on the nation’s mineral-rich federal lands, it usually must file a permit with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) first.

“And they grind along and then you got to go over to” a succession of agencies for further reviews, almost always including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Sanderson said, noting the laborious process can take years and be hamstrung at any point by lawsuits.
The federal permitting process is “cumbersome” and disjointed, she said.
“Each agency has its own procedure and process,” and it is step-by-step sequential instead of simultaneous, she said.
Ideally, she said, every agency “gets one bite at the apple” in one comprehensive 90-day review and then the applicant has 90 days to respond to any issues cited in the permit and environmental reviews.

The 180-day permit review kicks off “a two-year clock” in which all parties resolve issues, she said. If there’s no agency decision at the end of two years, “the project is considered to be approved” and it can begin.
That same timeline applies to litigation, requiring lawsuits to be filed no later than two years after a permit is filed and resolved no later than four years from that date, Sanderson said.
“If a dozen nonprofits and two tribes have issues, they have to come together and present one consolidated complaint that addresses their concerns,” she said.
Without such permitting and litigation timelines and consolidations, the private investment needed to fuel the nation’s domestic energy production will be difficult to secure, Sanderson said.

Investors aren’t going to put their money into something that could take decades to develop, if at all, she said.
“Ten to 30 years? Okay, you call me when you’re in production, buddy,” she said
There’s no reason this can’t happen, Sanderson said, noting “Australia has cut it down to two years. For America to do it in four years would be incredible.”
She cited Rio Tinto’s Resolution copper project in Arizona as an example.

“Twenty years of pouring money into the ground and they still don’t have a mine,” she said.
Trump’s pledge to streamline permitting is a keystone in his “Drill, baby, drill” campaign pitch to deregulate energy production and domestically source key minerals and ores.
“Getting permit reform is the number one priority the federal government should be focused on,” Sanderson said. “Everybody has got to work together in a concerted way.”
Meanwhile, environmental groups opposed the proposal, suggesting it was illegal and a violation of the National Environmental Policy Act, a 54-year-old law that requires federal agencies to study the potential environmental impact of proposed actions and consider alternatives.

Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group, said the plan involved Trump “offering to sell out America to the highest corporate bidder.”
She said it was another example of Trump “putting special interests and corporate polluters in the driver’s seat, which would result in more pollution, higher costs and fewer energy choices for the American people.”
Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, another environmental group, also expressed concern over the pledge.
“There’s a reason Congress requires the government to take a hard look at community impacts to make sure we don’t greenlight projects that do more harm than good,” Adams said.

[Equity investing in China isn't viewed the way equity investing is in America and even in Hong Kong. It's an entirely different philosophy. The majority of their wealth would be tied into real estate instead which is why many Chinese have become wealthy the past decade with a growing demand in urbanized housing.   Also, the government has an insane amount of control in the Chinese equity markets. What is happening to BABA right now is expected of the Chinese government to native Chinese individuals.   There's a reason why BABA and other large Asian companies choose to list under the U.S. and Hong Kong stock exchanges instead. Because it's much easier to raise the capital they need since the financial capacity of Hong Kong and the United States are more geared towards the capital market.   Chinese regulations to go public is very strict and highly regulated. However, there is a lot of fraud involved once the company goes public such as insider trading and falsified statements. There is still a huge mistrust in Chinese equities not just for Americans but the Chinese as well.  To sum it up, the equity market in China is not heavily emphasized as much as it is in the USA. Even comparing Hong Kong's market to China is vastly different.](/r/StockMarket/comments/pvzg3b/in_last_10_years_why_did_msci_china_and_china/hee196k/)

[Wash sales are applied on *replacement* securities.

However, if your old 100 shares are &gt;31 days old (and you keep them), and you buy 100 new shares of BABA, if BABA keeps going down you can sell the new shares &lt;31 days without triggering the wash sale rule, as you did not buy/sell them as replacement stock for your &gt;31 day old shares. However, this does not work if your old 100 shares are &lt;31 days old.  The wash rule applying on *replacement* stock only is why, if you buy a batch of 100 BABA (without having owned/sold BABA in the last 31 days), you can sell half of it at a loss within 31 days without triggering the wash sale rule.](/r/stocks/comments/pw5t4o/can_i_get_around_the_wash_sale_rule_by_buying_the/hef060i/)

[Firstly, shorting Chinese ADR stocks in the US is a popular trade, so that's dragging down the Chinese tech stocks far below their reasonable value.  The reversal in BABA should come in the near or intermediate term. The Hong Kong listed shares are being dragged down by US listed shares being sold and/or shorted, as you can see in the charts comparing the two listings over time. But the market cap of US-listed shares of BABA is dropping relative to the HK-listed shares. At some point, people in the US selling/shorting BABA ADR shares will lose the ability to impact the stock so much.   This is because once the stock hits a certain ratio of HK-listed market cap to foreign-listed market cap, the stock can qualify for StockConnect so that mainland Chinese can buy the HK-listed stock on the mainland exchanges. BABA is getting close to that point.  Edit: I also expect to see a bounce in foreign stocks after the end of the month. Hedge funds &amp; institutional investors have to report their holdings at the end of the quarter, and they spend the last 2 weeks before the end of the quarter selling stocks that they don't want their critics to see them holding. So unpopular or politically sensitive stocks like old energy, foreign stocks and other money-makers will get sold off, or people will suspend buying them, and then buying will resume after the end of the quarter.](/r/stocks/comments/putqb4/baba_never_ending_dip/he7t5jv/)

[I think BABA at this level is a solid buy and hold.   It was overvalued, like everything in the market, at it's ATH.  That plus political pressure has burst the bubble.   These are the kinds of situations you look for if you are investing long-term.    Will it give you 100% in the next year?  Not likely.  But I think if you buy it and let it sit for 5-10 years.  You'll be happy with the investment.    Unless China's economy completely collapses.  But I think that is a bold projection and if you believe that I'm not sure why you would invest in any equities at all.](/r/stocks/comments/putqb4/baba_never_ending_dip/he8nv6z/)

[Seven Recommendations for the New Administration and Congress: Building U.S. Critical Minerals Security](https://www.csis.org/analysis/seven-recommendations-new-administration-and-congress-building-us-critical-minerals)

https://preview.redd.it/wx93d48m9u6e1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6c817b0e57636071fc0836a7869bf72bf4ed8ac

Building minerals security is one of the most bipartisan goals in Washington. The United States first opened its Bureau of Mines in 1910 to coordinate minerals security needs. It was closed in 1996. In many ways, the U.S. government rapidly decelerated its efforts over the subsequent two decades. However, over the last seven years, the United States realized its reliance on China for critical minerals posed serious risks to its national and energy security alongside its economic competitiveness and prosperity.

In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, intending to improve the management of critical minerals needed for economic prosperity and energy security. In 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14017, which led to a review of U.S. critical mineral and material supply chain vulnerabilities. The assessment released by the Biden administration discovered that the overreliance on adversarial countries posed a threat to national and economic security.

The Biden administration and Congress advanced important efforts to address these vulnerabilities, including through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CHIPS and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Minerals Security Partnership, and increased capitalization of the Defense Production Act. However, the United States remains highly reliant on China given its decades-long advantage.

With a new administration and Congress taking office in January 2025, the Critical Minerals Security Program at CSIS has created seven recommendations for accelerating efforts to create resilient minerals supply chains and safeguard U.S. interests.

The current focus of both the U.S. government and industry is on the extent to which tariffs will be used to achieve the overarching objective. The reality is that a combination of sticks and carrots will be required. Permitting reform and subsidies can help build domestic production and processing capabilities. Overusing tariffs can have a negative impact. For commodities that the United States has limited or no supply of or is at early-stage development, imposing high tariffs can have two consequences: (1) it can make goods too expensive for end users to purchase, leading to a chokehold on important U.S. industries and jobs central to economic prosperity and national security, and (2) high tariffs on mineral imports can drive producing countries to export elsewhere (likely China)—which could strengthen China’s dominant position in minerals supply chains. Incentives to invest domestically and in allied countries will be an important carrot to stimulate mineral production and processing. Without this investment, building resilient supply chains will be nearly impossible.

# Recommendation 1: Create a Renewed Bureau of Mines to Expand Domestic Mining Capabilities

Building a new mine in the United States takes an average of [29 years](https://www.eenews.net/articles/us-mine-development-among-worlds-slowest-report-finds/)**—**the second longest in the world. Obtaining [permission](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106395.pdf) to operate a mine in the United States today involves securing federal, state, and local permits, as well as ensuring compliance with redundant regulations. A project can require up to [30 permits](https://natlawreview.com/article/permitting-reform-united-states#google_vignette), many of which are duplicative.

The specific permits needed vary depending on the mine’s location and its proposed operations. Streamlining permits has received bipartisan federal support in both the Trump and Biden administrations. President Trump’s [Executive Order 13953](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-10-05/pdf/2020-22064.pdf) directed agency heads: “As appropriate and consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits and the completion of projects in connection with expanding and protecting the domestic supply chain for minerals.” The Biden administration kept this executive order.

The U.S. [Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-16-165) noted that ineffective government coordination can delay federal permitting by up to three years. Centralizing government support for permitting the creation of a mine through a Bureau of Mines can accelerate permitting and incentivize domestic mine development. [Canada and Australia](https://mineralsmakelife.org/blog/us-lags-in-mine-development/) have agencies that oversee mine development. Establishing a bureau could be done through an executive order or Congress.

There has been bipartisan congressional support for streamlining permitting. In 2024, Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced the [Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4753/text) to streamline permitting. The legislation would simplify the long and expensive process of building mines, while still protecting the environment and surrounding communities.

# Recommendation 2: Develop Incentives to Safeguard U.S. Industries

Building mining and processing capabilities is capital-intensive. Current market conditions are a deterrent to building capabilities**—**lithium, cobalt, and nickel prices are at [multi-year lows](https://www.csis.org/analysis/drivers-base-metals-price-volatility). The IRA sought to provide incentives for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, through provisions such as the [Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Credit](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x), which established mineral sourcing requirements from the United States and countries it has a free trade agreement with (FTA).

However, not all mineral-intensive industries received incentives. The [CHIPS and Science Act of 2022](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip) provided $280 billion for advanced chip manufacturing. Yet, it only included support for chip manufacturing, packaging, and workforce development and provided no support for securing mineral inputs. This poses a significant threat. The United States is highly reliant and dependent on China and Russia for four minerals vital to semiconductor production**—**germanium, gallium, palladium, and polysilicon.

Incentives are also needed for the minerals required for the defense industry, including aluminum, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, indium, manganese, nickel, rare earths, tantalum, titanium, and tungsten. The United States is highly reliant on Chinese firms for sourcing a number of these commodities.

Incentives for the automotive industry remain important to protect domestic firms and U.S. jobs. In June 2024, automotive manufacturing jobs reached a [34-year high](https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2024/08/21/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-auto-manufacturing-jobs-at-34-year-peak/) in the United States—the highest since 1990. The IRA drove the development of a labor-intensive “Battery Belt” of factories in the Southeast. It also mobilized $114 billion in private-sector EV-related investments that are forecasted to create [99,600 jobs](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/inflation-reduction-act-two-years-later-auto-manufacturing-jobs-34-year-peak#:~:text=In%20the%20automotive%20sector%2C%20the,a%20significant%20source%20of%20employment.). Terminating incentives to the domestic automotive sector will generate negative economic consequences—including China further outpacing the United States by creating a cost-competitive EV industry that it can export worldwide, falling behind on research and development, and job losses.

# Recommendation 3: Expand Domestic Capabilities while Bolstering Strategic International Partnerships

At a recent CSIS Critical Minerals Security Program roundtable, a former U.S. ambassador noted, “Processing is often commercially stupid but strategically important for U.S. interests.” Processing profit margins are often [quite low](https://ecfr.eu/publication/material-world-how-europe-can-compete-with-china-in-the-race-for-africas-critical-minerals/) and sometimes even unprofitable. However, without financial support to the private sector to build domestic capabilities, China will continue its processing dominance, leaving the United States vulnerable to China’s more frequent use of export restrictions. Although [China](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x) produces just 10 percent of the world’s cobalt, lithium, and nickel, it imports vast quantities allowing it to process 60–90 percent of the global supply of these base metals. These processing capabilities were built using state support.

The United States has made noteworthy progress in building domestic midstream capacity—over the last four years, it has disbursed over $300 million to build domestic rare earth processing capabilities through the Defense Production Act. However, given that the United States has roughly 1.3 percent of the world’s rare earths, deploying incentives for rare earth mining projects in Brazil and Vietnam, which cumulatively hold [37 percent](https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-chinas-ban-rare-earths-processing-technology-exports-means) of the world’s reserves, will be vital to provide feedstock for separation facilities and manufacturing magnets in the United States.

The recently published final rules for [Section 45X](https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-department-treasury-releases-final-ruling-section-45x) of the IRA seek to do just this—mineral processors that use [both](https://www.eenews.net/articles/treasury-slashes-taxes-to-boost-critical-minerals/) domestic and imported ore from abroad qualify for the credit if, and only if, the processing is done in the United States to create end projects.

The joint domestic-international approach will be vital to building U.S. nuclear power capabilities, which is a bipartisan priority. Historically, it has been highly reliant on Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2022, the United States imported [nearly 25 percent](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-says-us-ban-russian-nuclear-fuel-will-harm-global-market-2024-05-14/) of its domestic enriched uranium consumption from Russia. To reduce this national security vulnerability, the United States is building domestic uranium enrichment capabilities for the first time in decades. Most recently, in September 2024, Orano announced that it would build a multibillion-dollar centrifuge uranium enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. However, the United States has less than 1 percent of the world’s uranium. While it can mine this, in the long-term, expanding support to production in [Australia, Canada, and Namibia](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium), which cumulatively hold 46 percent of the world’s uranium, will be important to feed domestic enrichment facilities and increase nuclear power capacity.

# Recommendation 4: Expand the Beneficiaries List for Current and Future Minerals Incentives

The only beneficiaries of the IRA are those that the United States has a FTA with. This is counterproductive, given the large mineral reserves in countries like Argentina, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Tanzania.

If the United States is to catch up, deploying investment incentives in a wider range of countries to source minerals for domestic processing and manufacturing is key. Tariffs can disincentivize resource-rich countries from exporting their resources to the United States and allied countries and instead encourage exporting to China. In 2022, countries that sent the [largest shares of minerals](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CHN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/25-26_Minerals) to China for processing and/or manufacturing included Australia ($96.4 million), Brazil ($27.6 million), Chile ($20.4 million), Peru ($19.6 million), South Africa ($11.4 million), Guinea ($4.5 million), Indonesia ($4 million) and Kazakhstan ($3.9 million).

The lack of U.S. incentives has enabled China to gain control of many African natural resources—a continent well-endowed with rare earths, palladium, manganese, cobalt, copper, graphite, nickel, and uranium. China’s [foreign direct investment](https://www.csis.org/analysis/window-opportunity-build-critical-mineral-security-africa) in Africa increased from $75 million in 2003 to $4.2 billion in 2020, much of which was concentrated in the extractive sector. The value of trade jumped from $10 billion in 2000 to $25 billion in 2021—over four times the increase between the United States and Africa. Yet, there is little incentive for Western firms to mine in Africa. Morocco is the only country in Africa eligible for IRA benefits even though it has very small mineral reserves.

# Recommendation 5: Reform the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to Better Fund Minerals Projects

The Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was created during the first Trump administration through the [Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2463), also known as the BUILD Act. The U.S. government has turned to the DFC for financing its mineral security needs abroad. The BUILD Act is up for congressional reauthorization in 2025—creating room for necessary reforms to better finance strategic minerals projects.

The DFC has financed a small number of important projects over the last five years that have directly reduced U.S. vulnerability to Chinese export restrictions. This included a [$150 million](https://www.syrahresources.com.au/news/syrah-receives-us-150m-dfc-loan-for-balama) loan to Syrah Resources for a graphite project in Mozambique. The graphite is then sent to Syrah’s processing facilities in Louisiana. It became particularly important after China imposed restrictions on graphite exports in 2023—a significant blow given it processes roughly 90 percent of the world’s graphite. 

There are two actions that can significantly improve the DFC’s capacity to support minerals security interests. First, the White House’s Office of Budget Management should revise its rules to make it easier for the DFC to make equity investments in critical minerals projects. Equity offers an important signal to both companies and countries. Government investment can help attract additional private capital and facilitate government-to-government cooperation and negotiations.

Second, enabling the DFC to invest in high-income resource-rich countries is important. At present the DFC is unable to finance projects in high-income countries such as Chile and Canada, that could provide mineral inputs for vital industries. This can be addressed in the same way that Congress did during the last Trump administration to strengthen Europe’s energy security. The [European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019](https://www.dfc.gov/investment-story/sourcing-critical-minerals-support-global-clean-energy-transition) authorized the DFC to provide financing to energy projects in high-income European countries, including Poland where it provided a $500 million loan guarantee for a liquified natural gas project.

# Recommendation 6: Quickly Appoint Effective Ambassadors in Mineral-Rich Jurisdictions

For too long, nominees at the ambassador level have not been properly equipped to facilitate minerals diplomacy. Appointees in mineral-rich countries have lacked the necessary expertise, resources, and interest necessary to advance mineral security goals. The next administration should take greater care to appoint ambassadors who will provide the support needed to advance minerals diplomacy efforts and prioritize mining objectives. These appointments should be filled quickly—a long delay can negatively impact the bilateral relationship. Ambassadors play a key role in everything from negotiating contracts to engaging in dispute resolution. Industry resounded that a strong U.S. ambassador can de-risk investments in jurisdictions around the world. In Zambia, the appointment of Ambassador Michael Gonzales came after a long period without an ambassador. His appointment ushered in significant advancements in U.S.-Zambia minerals cooperation, including opening the first-ever [Commercial Service Office](https://znbc.co.zm/news/us-opens-commercial-service-office-in-zambia/) at the U.S. Embassy in Lusaka; entering into a [Tripartite Alliance](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023.01.13-E-4-Release-MOU-USA-DRC-ZAMBIA-Tripartite-Agreement-Tab-1-MOU-for-U.S.-Assistance-to-Support-DRC-Zambia-EV-Value-Chain-Cooperation-Instrument.pdf) with the United States, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo for the raw material extraction, processing, and manufacturing for batteries; and providing support to [KoBold](https://www.mining.com/web/zambia-sees-bill-gates-backed-kobold-spending-2-3-billion-on-giant-copper-mine/), a U.S. firm building one of the largest copper projects in Zambia.

# Recommendation 7: Add Copper to the Department of the Interior’s Critical Minerals List

Copper is not identified as a critical mineral by the U.S. Department of Interior, although there is bipartisan consensus that it should be. The department’s list is only revised every three years. This will require changing the methodology for how criticality is calculated can be done through an executive order. In 2022, the United States consumed 1.8 million metric tons of copper, making it the [second largest](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0722/The-Future-of-Copper_Full-Report_14July2022.pdf) consumer in the world after China. But the United States is facing an impending shortage.

Copper is vital for national security, economic competitiveness, and energy security. It is a necessary material for many of the advanced technologies that make up the modern global economy from infrastructure and clean energy technologies to defense technologies, electronics, and automotives. Copper is the [second](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/as-americas-military-rearms-it-needs-minerals-and-lots-of-them/) most widely used material in weapon platforms by weight. Copper wires connect electrical grids, integrated circuits, and telecommunications systems. The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is putting further pressure on copper demand. The data centers that process AI applications could demand up to [200,000 metric tons](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-siphons-copper-supplies-needed-for-green-transition-8fef79e6) of copper per year between 2025 and 2028, adding another 2.6 million metric tons to the copper deficit in 2030.

Adding copper to the Department of Interior’s critical minerals list is an important signal to the private sector. Importantly, it makes copper eligible for existing and future critical minerals incentives, which is vital for encouraging investments in a capital-intensive sector. These incentives can also encourage building domestic refining capabilities. Currently, the United States only has [three smelters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/grupo-mexicos-asarco-reopen-us-copper-smelter-amid-surging-prices-2024-05-24/).

# Conclusion

The United States urgently needs to reduce its reliance on China for the critical minerals that are the bedrock of national and energy security and economic competitiveness and prosperity. Ultimately, while tariffs are protectionist, they can create a chokehold for vital industries and undermine U.S. interests. Innovative instruments are necessary. These recommendations are centered on enhancing the security of key minerals supply chains by addressing domestic bottlenecks, developing new incentives to safeguard U.S. interests, and leveraging commercial diplomacy with allies.

# DEC. 13TH 2024 ~Canada Contemplates Export Tax on Critical Minerals in Response to Proposed Trump Tariffs

[Technology Metals Report (12.13.2024): Canada Contemplates Export Tax on Critical Minerals in Response to Proposed Trump Tariffs - InvestorNews](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/technology-metals-report-12-13-2024-canada-contemplates-export-tax-on-critical-minerals-in-response-to-proposed-trump-tariffs/)

https://preview.redd.it/3fn2tgyq9u6e1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faf5960883c3c907e392d8bdf4c8996762c99315

Last week’s news in the critical minerals sector was marked by several significant developments reflecting the growing geopolitical tensions and strategic movements by major global players.

One of the most impactful announcements came from Canada, where the government is [contemplating](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-danielle-smith-doesnt-support-tariffs-alberta-oil-gas/) an export tax on essential commodities like oil, as well as critical minerals such as uranium and potash, in response to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canadian imports. This proposal has triggered a heated debate among Canadian provincial leaders, with Alberta’s Premier Danielle Smith warning of a national unity crisis and others suggesting various retaliatory measures.

Meanwhile, the [rise](https://www.ft.com/content/14dad9e1-bfda-4c00-b1b6-9dd41842650a) of resource nationalism continues to reshape global strategies for securing critical minerals such as lithium and copper, crucial for technological and green industries. Countries are intensifying state interventions to ensure access to these vital resources, reacting to broader geopolitical conflicts and the ongoing repercussions of the pandemic. This trend is accompanied by significant policy shifts and increased governmental control over mineral resources, highlighting the strategic importance of these materials in the current global landscape.

On the corporate front, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO | ASX: RIO | LSE: RIO) has [announced](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-spend-25-bln-expand-argentina-lithium-project-capacity-2024-12-12/) a substantial investment of $2.5 billion to expand its lithium production in Argentina, signaling strong market demand projections for lithium by 2030. This move is part of a broader strategy by major mining companies to ramp up production capacities for minerals essential for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, amidst fluctuating market prices.

In Europe, the spotlight was on the UK’s strategic [initiative](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/uk-government-offers-a-helping-hand-to-companies-that-extract-critical-minerals/) to enhance its economic resilience and supply chain stability by supporting overseas critical mineral projects. Led by the UK Department for International Trade, this effort is aimed at securing essential minerals like lithium, graphite, and cobalt, which are pivotal for the electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors. The government’s approach includes providing credit guarantees to foster international partnerships, particularly with mineral-rich nations, aligning with broader efforts to build secure and responsible supply chains.

# DOD and NRCan invest in advancing Fireweed Metals' Mactung mine project, supporting North America's critical mineral needs.

***In a strategic bid to establish secure and reliable North American supplies of minerals critical to defense and the broader economy, the U.S. Department of Defense and Canadian government are jointly investing up to US$27.3 million (C$35.4 million) to aid Fireweed Metals Corp. in advancing the Mactung tungsten mine project in eastern Yukon toward a final investment decision, as well as the infrastructure needed to unlock the company's broader critical minerals district along the Yukon-Northwest Territories border.***

Rising global demand and geopolitical tensions have prompted the U.S. and Canada to jointly and independently invest in domestic mineral production and processing, reducing reliance on imports and bolstering supply chains vital to economic growth, technology, and defense.

China's [recent export bans on gallium, germanium, and antimony](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/12/04/tech-metals/china-export-ban-deals-blow-to-us-economy/2052.html) have heightened these concerns.

Under the expanding partnership between DOD and the Canadian government, several Canadian companies have received significant funding to strengthen North America's critical minerals supply chains.

Electra Battery Materials Corp. secured US$20 million (C$27.3 million) from DOD to complete its Ontario Cobalt Refinery, while Fortune Minerals Ltd. received joint investments of US$6.4 million (C$8.7 million) from both governments to advance its NICO cobalt-gold-bismuth-copper project in Northwest Territories.

These collaborations exemplify a coordinated effort to mitigate reliance on foreign sources, particularly China and Russia, while bolstering economic growth and supply chain resilience across the continent.

Marking a critical move in potentially securing North American supplies of tungsten, as well as other minerals critical to both countries, the latest U.S.-Canada collaboration will see DOD award up US$15.8 million (C$22.5 million) in Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III funding to advance Mactung toward a final investment decision; and up to C$12.9 million (US$9.9 million) from the Canadian government, through the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund (CMIF), to lead planning for road and power to support the additional critical minerals assets at Fireweed's flagship Macmillan Pass project.

""The coordinated investments by the United States and Canadian governments underscore the critical importance and strategic value of Fireweed's mineral assets at Macmillan Pass,"" said Fireweed Metals President and CEO Peter Hemstead. ""This joint announcement is a testament to the determination of both governments to unlock this new critical minerals district in Canada.

646,1h6n9v0,Mineral &amp; Energy Economics: Colorado School of Mines- High finance outcomes ,Next_Willingness_333,/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1h6n9v0/mineral_energy_economics_colorado_school_of_mines/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1h6n9v0/mineral_energy_economics_colorado_school_of_mines/,2,1,1733336925.0,"Hey! Many months ago I made a comment that I was an alumni of the program on this subreddit. Since then, I’ve gotten 4-5 people reach out interested, so I wanted to drop an informational post for everyone (I don’t benefit monetarily from promoting this program I swear)

I also figured this post would be appropriate for this forum- a large part of the program consists of people who studied engineering, and they are often some of the most successful alumni. 

No GRE/GMAT required for masters students. 

There is a Reciprocity with University of Denver’s JD program. It allows for up to 6 credit hours to be double counted for the masters degree and 12 to be double counted for the PhD. 

Program length- 1.5 to 2 years (30 credit hours)

Program structure- You have the opportunity to take econometrics electives and economics electives in the mining and energy space. Some examples are Metals and Mining Markets, Economics of Energy and Mining, and Time Series Econometrics, with special focus on energy and other commodity data. 
There are some business classes too, with a personal favorite being Economic Evaluation and Investment Decision Methods. We also have a new course dedicated to commodity trading. It’s worth mentioning- you are allowed to transfer up to 15 credit hours from other graduate programs, either at mines or already taken elsewhere.

Example workplaces of alumni: Morgan Stanley, World Bank, J.P. Morgan, Newmont Mining, Rio Tinto, Vale, Vitol, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, McKinsey &amp; Company, Boston Consulting Group, Bain &amp; Co., the CIA, Stantec, Caterpillar, BMO Capital Markets, Cannacord Genuity, ING, Resource Capital Finance, Xcel Energy, Point 72, Citi, S&amp;P Global, Rystad Energy, Wood Mackenzie, BNP Paribas, Oxy, SSR, Google, Freeport McMoran, Wolverine Fuels, starting their own firms, etc.

Alumni have also worked in public service. Top of my head, I’ve seen alumni working for the USGS, the US Department of Energy (including their labs Argonne, NREL, and Sandia), the U.S. Army, the State of Colorado, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. EPA, as well as many other foreign government roles. 

Jobs include investment bankers, private equity professionals, corporate development professionals, mineral economists, policy advisors and researchers, commodity traders (electricity trading seems to be a popular interest), consultants (whether strategy or otherwise), etc. 

Degrees achievable: Master of Science and PhD
PhDs are fully funded, masters students are funded when available. Total time to complete the PhD is 4 years. There is also the opportunity to earn a dual masters in Energy Technology Economics and Management at IFP in Paris. 

Students pursuing further education have ended up in programs such as the JD programs at Denver, Lewis and Clark and Texas- Austin, in PhD programs in economics at other universities, University of Arizona’s Mining Engineering masters, and at Yale’s MBA program. 

There are opportunities to work part time as a grader or doing research with either the Payne Institute of Public Policy or the Critical Minerals Institute. 

The school is located in Golden, CO. Golden is located near many hiking trails and beautiful mountain features. Skiing and hiking are easily within driving distance. The program also benefits from its proximity to Denver, which is a U.S. mining hub. Many energy companies- both oil and gas and renewables- also call the state home.

Please reach out if you have any comments! ",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:04.683221,2024-12-05T05:28:45,Rio Tinto,2024

#Trading Update

  * Market update – stocks rebounded throughout Asia (w/the exception of mainland China)
and the major Eurozone indices have a mild bid. US futures are up small. Nothing major
occurred overnight on the eco data/monetary fronts although there were a slew of articles
focusing on taxes and infrastructure spending. Axios says Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to couple the two
together in order to secure some support from Democrats (http://bit.ly/2obRa3v) while
Thy God-Emperor Trump may struggle to get the corporate rate much below 28% according to the NYT
(http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV). Overall the broader macro narrative stayed largely unchanged
over the last 12-18 hours (see below). The big focus on Tues will likely be on Fed speakers
(both Yellen and Fischer will be delivering comments) although Brady’s tax meeting will be
important too.

  * Calendar for Tues 3/28 – the focus will be on the US advanced goods trade balance for Feb
(8:30amET), US wholesale inventories for Feb (8:30amET), US Case-Shiller home prices for
Jan (9amET), US consumer confidence for Mar (10amET), some Fed speakers (including
Yellen at 12:50pmET and Fischer on CNBC at ~1:30pmET), Brady’s House Ways sand Means
Committee meeting (at which taxes will be discussed), Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate change executive
order, analyst meetings (CY), and earnings (CCL, DRI, INFO, and MKC pre-open and SONC,
VRNT after the close).

  * FX/TSYs – the DXY is stabilizing after slumping ~45bp on Mon (the DXY is up ~10bp so far
Tues morning). The USD is flat vs. the EUR and JPY and is down small against the GBP.
Treasuries are pretty flat.

  * Europe – the major Eurozone indices are up ~25bp. Autos, basic resources, tech, banks,
media, and utilities are outperforming while staples, fin services, real estate, and telecoms
are lagging. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in the SXXP after posting solid earnings.
Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital “as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit
at the open after issuing a restructuring update but the stock has since bounced. Redrow
said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s largest shareholders are calling on the
co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Asia – most of the major markets rebounded w/the exception of mainland China: Japan
(TPX +1.34%, NKY +1.14%), Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.63%, HSCEI +0.62%), mainland China
(SHCOMP -0.43%, Shenzhen -0.25%, CSI 300 -0.24%), Taiwan (TAIEX flat), Korea (KOSPI
+0.35%), Australia (ASX 200 +1.3%), and India (up ~50bp for the major indices). There
weren’t any major macro headlines out of Asia. Within the NKY all major sub-groups saw
gains but healthcare, materials, fins, real estate, and utilities were esp. strong. SUMCO
jumped following pos. sell-side comments (the stock jumped 5.3%). Names levered to
SUMCO rallied in sympathy (Micronics, Advantest, Tokyo Electron, etc.). In Hong Kong, top
performers included Lenovo (+4.1%) and some Macau-linked stocks (Sands China +4.02%,
Galaxy +3.52%, etc.). In Taiwan large-cap tech was mixed (TSMC +0.78%, Hon Hai +0.77%
vs. Largan -1.25%, Catcher -1.5%) and fins underperformed. In Korea chemical stocks were
strong (LG Chem, Lotte Chemical, etc.) while Samsung Electronics rose 0.68%.

#US macro update

  * The bigger picture backdrop remains (frustratingly) unchanged. Healthcare was/is a net
negative for the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Ryan agenda but it is by no means fatal and so long as investors
anticipate some action on the tax front the SPX will struggle to experience significant
weakness (investors appear to appreciate that the tax process is in its very early stages and
thus are willing to wait a few more months for details). The nominal growth backdrop
remains supportive and many think the SPX would be capable of posting ~$133-135 in ’18
EPS w/o anything happening in Washington (the mid-point of that range could support the
SPX at ~2250-2300 which means there isn’t an excessive amount of political hope in
stocks). The biggest risk for the time being really isn’t political (the entire market is closely
scrutinizing Washington and near-term political expectations are low) but instead
concerns growth – sentiment around growth has grown quite upbeat (both towards real
growth and inflation) but also very complacent and risks are rising (widening gap between
surveys and hard data, soft Mar US flash PMIs, soft oil prices, etc.). It’s tough to foresee the
growth narrative turning more positive from present levels and any reversal could undercut
the $133-135 ’18 Washington-neutral EPS range. Keep in mind the calendar is pretty
sparse over the next few weeks – aside from some eco data this Fri (US/EU inflation and
China PMIs), the FOMC minutes (Wed 4/5), the Thy God-Emperor Trump/Xi summit (4/6-7), and US Mar jobs
(Fri 4/7), most investors are now looking towards the upcoming CQ1 earnings season (which
starts Thurs morning 4/13).

#Top Headlines for Tuesday

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump wants to do tax reform and infrastructure together according to Axios. Thy God-Emperor Trump feels
“burned” by the House Freedom Caucus and he knows that combining infrastructure into a
tax bill could help win some support from Democrats. Axios. http://bit.ly/2obRa3v

  * Tax overhaul – 1986 vs. 2017. An AP article looks at the differences between now and ’86 –
“tax overhaul efforts lacks advantages Reagan enjoyed in ‘86”. Reagan was popular and
worked w/powerful and experienced leaders in Congress. All the key principals had
established and trusting relationships. The situation facing President Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump
features none of those advantages. AP http://apne.ws/2mLzUoK

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final tax bill, to the extent he can even achieve one, may look very different from
what he promised on the campaign trail. During the campaign Thy God-Emperor Trump talked about a 15%
corporate tax rate. That was subsequently revised to 15-20% and now people in the WH are
talking about &gt;20%. However, Thy God-Emperor Trump’s final corporate tax rate may be as high as 28% if he
wants his plan to be revenue-neutral. Note that 28% was the same rate proposed by
Obama in ’12-’16. Most on Wall St are assuming a rate of no higher than 25%. NYT
http://nyti.ms/2npLQJV

  * Healthcare – despite the failure of ACHA, Thy God-Emperor Trump and the GOP face a big decision that
could severely undermine the public insurance exchanges. House Republicans filed a
lawsuit in 2014 to block subsides paid to insurers participating in the ACA exchanges but the
case was delayed as Ryan pursued repeal/replace. Thy God-Emperor Trump and Ryan could ask for the
lawsuit to continue as soon as May. Without these subsidies the few insurers still
participating in the exchanges would either exit the market completely or significantly raise
premiums. Even the threat of losing the premiums could have a dramatic effect. Insurers
must decide by June whether to participate in the exchanges next year. WSJ.
http://on.wsj.com/2ntDHpy

  * Schumer and McConnell headed for an “epic” clash over the Supreme Court and
government funding. Schumer is “itching for a fight” and the upcoming Gorsuch
confirmation and Apr 28 funding expiration will give him two great opportunities to wage
battle. Schumer said McConnell may not have the votes needed to break a Gorsuch
filibuster. Politico. http://politi.co/2nH8yz8

  * Republicans prob. won’t include funding for Thy God-Emperor Trump’s Mexico wall in the upcoming budget;
Republicans don’t want a shutdown battle in Apr and thus could exclude wall funding from
the budget as a result – Politico http://politi.co/2ncanQO

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump on Tues to sign an executive order that would begin the process of undoing much
of Obama’s climate agenda – Thy God-Emperor Trump’s order would instruct regulators to rewrite key rules
curbing US carbon emissions, lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing, and remove the
requirement that federal officials consider the impact of climate change when making
decisions. Most of the Thy God-Emperor Trump order will take years to implement and is unlikely to alter
the shift away from coal and towards nat. gas and renewables. Washington Post.
http://wapo.st/2mLwUbQ

  * Thy God-Emperor Trump’s climate order won’t help either energy independence or coal mining employment
– the US already consumes all its own coal and coal mining jobs have been cut by
automation and increased nat. gas demand. NYT http://nyti.ms/2nven2f

  * Company-specific news update from Tues morning. Wolseley is one of the top stocks in
the SXXP after posting solid earnings. Credit Suisse said it would make a decision on capital
“as soon as possible”. Ericsson was hit at the open after issuing a restructuring update but
the stock has since bounced. Redrow said it will not make a bid for Bovis. Two of Tesco’s
largest shareholders are calling on the co to drop its bid for Booker. Akzo Nobel said it
would provide a strategy update on Apr 19.

  * Company-specific news update from Mon night. RHT’s results were strong, esp. the blowout
billings number for the Feb-end Q. SNX also was solid (better Feb-end results and inline
earnings). DRI reported earnings ahead of the St and announced plans to buy Cheddar’s for
$780MM in cash. Red Mountain sent a letter to DECK’s board and called on the co to
explore strategic alternatives. HOMB announced plans to buy SGBK. ALXN named a new
CEO.
 
  * China/semiconductors – Tsinghua Unigroup, China’s largest chipmaker, has secured ~$22B
in financing to pursue M&amp;A and build production capacity. Unigroup is in the process of
building a massive ~$30B memory plant. China in total plans to spend $150B over the next
10 years to secure a leading position in the global semi industry. Bloomberg.
http://bloom.bg/2otzBvd

  * CMCSA – the co is planning to rebrand and expand its streaming TV product. The new
service, which will be marked as Xfinity Instant TV, will cost $15-40/month and will be made
available to the &gt;50MM homes within the CMCSA footprint. Reuters.
http://cnb.cx/2o1b4RC

  * Bond buyers return w/a vengeance – the WSJ discusses the recent rally in Treasuries as
“Thy God-Emperor Trump Trades” reverse. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2otqfQb

  * Italy – despite all the anxiety around Thy God-Emperor Trump and France, the market’s biggest political risk is
still Italy. WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2ndmKgq

  * Iranian oil minister says global oil cuts deal likely to be extended – Reuters
http://reut.rs/2mLA8fu

 * Bank lending update from JPM’s D Silver - commercial bank lending has cooled notably in
recent months. Bank lending often weakens around recessions, and there has been some
concern over the recent slowing. But there are also a few instances in which bank lending
firmed again after a mid-expansion moderation, and we are not especially alarmed by the
recent slowing in the data. Given many signs that business investment has strengthened
more recently, we think the bank lending data will eventually firm. http://bit.ly/2o16zXg

 * Wall St research – Reuters discusses the “period of turmoil” facing the research industry
due to upcoming regulatory changes. Online research portals could gain share at the
expense of “bulge bracket” investment banks. According to one study, ~40K research
reports are produced every week by the world’s top 15 global investment banks but only 1%
are actually consumed by clients. Reuters http://reut.rs/2oc0Riq

#Washington – what comes next?

 * The next major issue to be addressed in Washington concerns the budget as the present
spending authorization is due to expire on Apr 28 – failure to sign a new budget (or a
Continuing Resolution) by that date could result in a “shutdown”. A shutdown on its own
wouldn’t be a major headache for stocks or the economy although at this time on gov’t
stoppage would probably have negative consequences as it 1) would reinforce the message
sent by the ACHA failure of Washington being hopelessly deadlocked and 2) raise doubts
about Washington acting smoothly on the debt ceiling (the debt ceiling probably doesn’t
have to be raised until later in the summer or early fall).

  * On taxes, the GOP is aggressively pivoting but there is a lot of work left to do. The
Ryan/Brady BAT bill is the only tax legislation that actually exists but (as has the case for
months) this bill can’t pass the Senate; if Ryan insists on commencing the tax debate w/his
BAT blueprint as the base case that could cause months of contentious negotiations and
drag the process into the fall at least (Brady’s House Ways and Means Committee has a
meeting Tues 3/28 at which it will discuss taxes). Thy God-Emperor Trump will play a big role – the White
House largely outsourced healthcare to Ryan but by getting involved early w/taxes it could
help steer the process towards a bill capable of passing both the House and Senate.

  * Without BATs and the ACHA savings it will be very difficult for any tax legislation to be
“revenue neutral” which means the GOP will have to 1) secure some Democratic support in
the Senate to overcome a likely filibuster or 2) sunset any changes after 10 years (like the
George W Bush tax cuts). Erstwhile GOP deficit hawks seem a bit more amenable to
unfinanced tax cuts (Meadows, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, this weekend said
taxes don’t have to be revenue neutral) but they are unlikely to countenance enormous
deficits.
 

  * The market right now assumes the corporate rate can be cut to ~25% (or lower) when all is
said and done – anything higher than that number is likely to underwhelm. The “easiest”
bill to pass would likely be some combination of a repatriation holiday and infrastructure
spending (this is likely going to be the fallback solution if taxes stay deadlocked into the late
fall) although passing either alone would likely foreclose the possibility of broader tax
action. Markets appreciate that tax reform won’t happen by Aug and most don’t even think
it can happen this year. However, investors are hoping to see a credible and passable
blueprint by the fall that can get to Thy God-Emperor Trump’s desk by early 2018.

#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Mar 27

  * There aren’t many major events scheduled this week other than some eco data (the most
important of which will likely be the US Feb PCE on Fri 3/31) and a few earnings reports.

  * Calendar for Wed 3/29 – the focus will be on the UK triggering of Article 50, US pending
home sales for Feb (10amET), some Fed speakers (Evans, Rosengren, and Williams), some
analyst meetings (ALK, DXC), the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch (in NYC), and earnings (PAYX,
SCWX, UNF pre-open and LULU and WOR after the close).

  * Calendar for Thurs 3/30 – the focus will be on some Fed speakers (Mester, Kaplan, Dudley,
and Williams), analyst meetings (AKAM, TECK), and earnings (SAIC pre-open).

  * Calendar for Fri 3/31 – the focus will be on China’s NBS manufacturing and nonmanufacturing
PMIs for Mar (out Thurs night/Fri morning), the Eurozone CPI for Mar
(5amET), the US personal income/spending/PCE for Feb (8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for
Mar (9:45amET), Michigan confidence numbers for Mar (10amET), and earnings (BBRY preopen).

648,1e1fcy0,"I'm a professional trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket after traders rotate out of Mag7 and into IWM. Here's where they are positioned now, post CPI. ",TearRepresentative56,/r/swingtrading/comments/1e1fcy0/im_a_professional_trader_and_this_is_everything/,https://www.reddit.com/r/swingtrading/comments/1e1fcy0/im_a_professional_trader_and_this_is_everything/,45,4,1720783881.0,"ANALYSIS:

**IWM up again in premarket. Is at the 52w high resistance, after big breakout. Calls build on 215 and 220 in the positioning data. If we can hold this 211.88 52w high level, we head higher to 215+.**

[https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25](https://imgur.com/a/G7pSA25) 

**Similarly Traders bet on return to 52w highs on TNA. Leveraged small caps so beware of that.**

[https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE](https://imgur.com/a/FL1rlbE) 

**I think the IWM, small cap buy case is strong. I was in from before CPI as I thought it was too bearish and would see squeeze. But I think CPI and unemployment data is now pointing to sept rate cut. I think Trump winning is bullish for Small caps too. I think there's reasons there for IWM to run**

**VIX: Slight spike yesterday, but traders are still V short volatility, with vix in contango. V much skewed to ITM puts. Traders will try to crush VIX again.**

[https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M](https://imgur.com/a/18wKM9M) 

Dow Jones positioning also looks bullish, with my target at 40k.

**Rotation we saw yesterday is normal given soft inflation print, which makes chance of rate cuts more likely. Hence traders rotated from mag7 into interest rate sensitive IWM. But there's no panic in markets, credit default swaps plunged, hence conditions bullish Traders will buy back Mag7 too soon.**

Some MAG7 more bullish than others. MSFT&lt; AMZN, AAPL, GOOGL the most bullish. NVDA somewhat. TSLA less so, as we see traders take profits. Its normal though given they had the robotaxi news, not just rotation. 

GOLD AND OIL POSITIONING ARE BULLISH AFTER CPI. 



DATA LEDE:

CHINA BALANCE OF TRADE data showed stronger than expected exports, up 8.6% vs 8% expected. Stronger global demand. 

However, still weak domestic demand, as imports fell -2.3% vs 2.8% expected.

Trade surplus highest since 1990

German wholesale prices come in at -0.3% MOM vs 0.2% expected. 

US PPI coming premarket.

US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Numbers and Inflation expectation numbers after market opens. 



YESTERDAY CPI REVIEW: Overall a v bullish CPI print, which supports September cut imo. This coupled with labour market data means Fed shouldn’t hesitate to cut rates. 

Lowest Y/Y CPI print since March 2021

First M/M decrease since May 2020. Down -0.1% vs expectation of 0.1% increase. 

Shelter component had smallest increase since Aug 2021

We saw a big fall in airline fares, down 5%, and we saw a big drop in used car prices. 

The drop in airline fares was corroborated by Delta airline earnings. 



MARKETS:

WE SAW PROFIT TAKING ON SPX AND NASDAQ YESTERDAY AS TRADERS ROTATED INTO SMALL CAPS WHICH HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY. 

SPX sold off form 5640 to 5577, before recovering slightly. Is currently trading at 5592. Just lost the gains from Wednesdays move. 

NASDAQ: Bigger sell off, as is more heavily weighted to the Mag7, which saw the most selling. Dropped from 20,700 to 20200. Flat here. 

Dow Jones: Moving higher, confirmed breakout, moved up to 39,800. Next target looks like 40k

GER40: European markets higher after soft CPI yesterday. 

Chinese market higher from the added restrictions on short selling which is an artificial support of the HKG market, also following US CPI hence supporting lower rates in US which helps chinese exports. 

Nikkei drops after hitting ATH earlier in the week. 

GOLD moving higher above 2400 after soft CPI

Oil recovering, positioning improving after Dollar weakness from CPI lead to recovery. 

VIX - jumped yesterday, but traders still v short on vix, hence we probably see sell off again. 



EARNINGS:

  
JPM 

EPS of 4.4 vs estimate of 4.28.

Adjusted revenue of 50.99B vs 50.21B estimate. 

Deposits were lower than expected

Metrics - Net charge offs of 2.231 beat 2.265B 

Tangible Book value per share was 92.77 vs 91.45 EST. 

Consumer &amp; Community Banking (CCB): $17.7B; UP +3% YoY

Banking &amp; Wealth Management: $10.4B; DOWN -5% YoY

Home Lending: $1.3B; UP +31% YoY

Card Services &amp; Auto: $6.0B; UP +14% YoY

Net Income: $4.2B; DOWN -21% YoY

Commercial &amp; Investment Bank (CIB): $17.9B; UP +9% YoY

Banking &amp; Payments: $9.0B; UP +9% YoY

Markets &amp; Securities Services: $9.0B; UP +8% YoY

Comments:

The Firm performed well in the second quarter, generating net income of $13.1 billion and a ROTCE of 20% after excluding a net gain on our Visa shares, a contribution to the Firm’s Foundation and discretionary securities losses

Biden still determined to run in 2024 presidential race. This despite losing his chain of thought in solo press conference. Mixed up the names of VP Harris and Trump. 

If Biden was to give up being democratic candidate, unless his VP is given the path, donations will have to be returned. As such, new candidate would be starting with 0 a few months before the election, v dangerous. 

Feds Goolsbee - doesnt feel like beginning of recession. Labour market cooling but still strong. Leaving fed policy same as inflation falls means policy is tightening.

June CPI report was EXCELLENT. Shelter inflation improvement was v encouraging. 

China’s foreign ministry imposes sanction on US military firms and senior execs over arms sales.

THIS WEEK'S MAIN STORY - **PHILADELPHIA UNION** ARE THE LAST MLS TEAM STANDING IN THE 2021 CONCACHAMPIONS, AND THAT MEANS THE WAGON NEEDS TO BE FULL OF MLS FANS BECAUSE HONESTLY WHO FUCKING HATES THE UNION?

WELL, SOME OF [YOU PEOPLE](https://youtu.be/x1iV24hL8Rk?t=7) ARE FANS OF EASTERN TEAMS AND PROBABLY HATE THE UNION CAUSE YOU CAN'T BEAT UP ON THEM ANYMORE. NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE THE SUPPORTERS SHIELD HOLDERS AND THEY DESERVE YOUR RESPECT UNTIL FORCED ROSTER TURNOVER PULLS THEM BACK DOWN NEAR THE BOTTOM. LUCKY FOR THE EAST, PHILADELPHIA WILL BE PULLING DOUBLE DUTY ON MEANINGFUL MATCHES IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. A HOME GAME AGAINST CLUB AMERICA ON MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE DAY? YOU KNOW THE UNION FRONT OFFICE SEES A WHOLE LOT OF DOLLAR SIGNS. 

UNION HAVE EARNED THEIR BERTH IN THE SEMIFINALS AND ARE IN FOR THE SERIES OF A LIFETIME. FOR AS MUCH AS A SHITSHOW AS THE OFFICIATING IS IN THE CONFEDERATION, THE MATCHES ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE ENTERTAINING EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF TURNOVER IN MLS IS THAT THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T SEND THE SAME 3 OR 4 TEAMS TO CONCACHAMPIONS EVERY YEAR.  EVEN MY HOMETOWN TEAM GOT CONCACAF'D AND [LOST IN PENALTIES](https://youtu.be/Sdw8fJY1_ag) TO A QUALITY TOLUCA SIDE. EVERYBODY GETS TO SHARE IN THE HEARTBREAK! THE LOSSES TO LMX SIDES WILL BE LESS FREQUENT AS MLS CONTINUES ON THE PATH TO RELEVANCE IN THE CONFEDERATION AND IN THE COUNTRY. PATIENCE, MLS FANS. THINGS USED TO BE MUCH WORSE. OH, AND I FORGOT THE BEST PART OF UNION IN THE SEMIS... THE ""PRESEASON FORM"" EXCUSE WON'T BE A THING. 

ON TO THE MATCHES

GENERALISSIMO DONALDO GARBERO HAS DONE SUCH A [GREAT JOB](https://youtu.be/c4psKYpfnYs) OF GROWING THE GAME THAT THE **SAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES** MATCH AT **REAL SALT LAKE** WILL BE ON TAPE DELAY IN THE BAY AREA (UNLESS YOU WANT TO STREAM FROM NBCSN CALIFORNIA). HOW THE LEAGUE HASN'T PUSHED THE TEAM TO GET THE GAME ON LOCAL OVER THE AIR TV FOR PEOPLE TO WATCH LIVE REALLY SHOWS HOW LITTLE EFFORT IS MADE TO LET PEOPLE WATCH THE PRODUCT LIVE IN THE HOME FUCKING MARKET.

THE AFOREMENTIONED UNION ARE UNDERDOGS FOR THEIR FIRST OF TWO VISITS TO SOLDIER FIELD TO PLAY **CHICAGO FIRE**. KICKING OFF SIMULTANEOUSLY WILL BE THE **TORONTO ROWDIES** MATCH AGAINST **NEW YORK B TEAM** AT RED BULL ARENA. 

30 MINUTES LATER, THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS **COLUMBUS CREW** (FUCK YOU, PRECOURT) ARE RECOVERING FROM THEIR CONCACHAMPIONS BEATDOWN AS THEY HOST LOS MAPACHES **DC UNITED**, A TEAM RECOVERING FROM ITS BEATDOWN OUT WEST. IF THAT MATCH DOESN'T TICKLE YOUR FANCY, HOW ABOUT THE FIRST LEG OF THE EMPTY NFL STADIUM CUP BETWEEN **NEW ENGLAND REVOLUTION** AND **NASHVILLE SC**?

THE SECOND MATCH OF THE 2021 CANADA'S CLOSED CUP HAS HOSTS **CAPAS BLANCAS DE VANCOUVER... EN SALT LAKE** AGAINST **CF MIAMTREAL**. NEXT UP IS UNIVISION'S SABADO FUTBOLERO AND THE FIRST MATCH OF THE TEXAS TRIANGLE! **FC DALLAS** AND **HOUSTON DYNAMO** HAVE THE SAME RECORD THROUGH THREE GAMES, WITH THE HOOPS HAVING SCORED 1 MORE GOAL THROUGH THREE GAMES THAN THEIR COASTAL OPPONENT. 

HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE **ORLANDO CITY SC** FANS FOUGHT VISITING **NEW YORK 2** FANS? REMEMBER WHEN THAT WAS A THING? LETS SEE IF THE LOCKDOWNS DID ANYTHING TO KILL THAT SURPRISINGLY VIOLENT RIVALRY. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, WE'LL SEE IT ON ESPN.

EL TRAFFICO! REMEMBER ZLATAN? REMEMBER? EL TRAFFICO! NOTHING ELSE MATTERS IN THIS LEAGUE BUT EL TRAFFICO!

A **COLORADO RAPIDS** WIN OVER **ACTUALLY UNITED FC** THIS WEEKEND WON'T KILL THE LOONS' PLAYOFF HOPES BECAUSE ITS STILL REALLY EARLY. BUT IT WILL SAY A LOT ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THEY ARE. 

SUNDAY SEES BIG BOY ABC GOING ALL IN ON MLS WITH DOUBLEHEADER ACTION! THE EARLY GAME CONSISTS OF **ATLANTA UNITED**'S FIRST TRIP TO SOUTH FLORIDA IN 2021 AS THEY LOOK TO REGAIN THEIR NORMALLY ADEQUATE FORM AGAINST BECKHAM'S **INTER-FOR-NOW MIAMI**. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THAT GAME AND IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE COUNTRY, ITS THE 2ND MOST POPULAR RIVALRY IN MLS! **SEATTLE SOUNDERS** WILL TRY TO AVOID CATCHING CORONAVIRUS WHILE IN THE FILTHY STATE OF OREGON TO FACE **PORTLAND TIMBERS**. WEAR YOUR MASKS, OREGONIANS, AND STAY ON YOUR SIDE OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER.

FINALLY THIS WEEKEND ON FS1 (THE ONE FOR DUMB), ITS THE SUCKER BET OF THE WEEKEND AS **BUSINESS METRICS FC** IS +240 TO WIN WHAT IS THEIR 3RD STRAIGHT ROAD GAME TO OPEN THE SEASON.

This is for us all to have a look at what it does, some of their financials, and in the end discuss whether or not we'd buy into it.

As /u/Phishbaron put it, think of it as a sort of ""group DD"" in which we pool our 5 collective braincells together and evaluate the chosen company.

The main purpose being to add some more variety in tickers to all the standard meme stocks we see pumped day in and day out, and hopefully discover some hidden gems - or at least, less stinky forms of dogshit.

The only other criteria is that the share price has to be under $2.

Let's give this a try boyos:

# Random ASX Stonk of the Week - Week 1:

**Company name:** Empired Ltd

**Ticker:** EPD

**Industry:** Information Technology

**Headquarters:** Perth

**Market cap:** $120m

**Current share price:** $0.75

**P/E ratio:** 10.2

**1-year Performance:** \+111.27%

**What they do, smoothbrain version:** nerds who charge ridiculous prices to do computer shit for companies &amp; governments

**What they say they do, wanky version:** *""We help you reimagine, transform and evolve for your best possible future, connected and enabled by technology.""* 🍆👋

**What they do, actual version:** Empired are a Sydney-based B2B IT ""integration services"" company that help their clients ""go digital"" in a wholistic way, e.g: switching them over to cloud-based systems, improving digital security, putting in automation, and helping them convert to ""agile"" work approaches.

Their revenue comes solely from Australia/NZ, and a big chunk of that is from contracts signed in Western Australia recently.

**What looks good:**

* Their last quarterly update was very impressive dollar-wise. While they only recorded a 7% increase in revenue, they managed to achieve a H1 Net profit after tax of $7.7m (up 284%)
* Operating cash flow of $17.5m, up 59.3%
* Good overall share price growth (100+%) for a company with a P/E ratio of just over 10
* Have contracts with some big bois out there, including Rio Tinto, the government, etc. These are multi-year so provide over 50% of revenue as recurring
* Decided to pay a (small) dividend for the first time, and aiming for a bigger one moving forward
* Healthy debt to equity ratio (e.g, not much debt)
* Their report designs are slick &amp; make something like Brainchip's look like they were made by a blind toddler whose Microsoft Office subscription is about to expire
* Their year on year financials are generally trending up YOY

**What doesn't look good:**

* Shitty name that I'm not sure how to pronounce. Is it ""Empire-d"" as in ""Empired Strikes Back"", or ""Empi-red"", as in the colour of my portfolio?
* JobKeeper played a role in pumping up their numbers
* Seems to be overly contract-dependent on several large clients for revenue... AVA flashbacks, anyone?
* Management only own about 10% of the shares on issue, not a particularly high percentage
* While their revenue is trending up YOY, it's not substantially so
* May be a beneficiary from the Covid-19 ""everyone panic cause we need the tech to be able to go digital/work from home better"" boom

**Conclusion:** EPD are coming off some pretty strong tailwinds that have benefitted a lot of stocks across the whole ASX. 

They look like one of the more fundamentally solid of the listed tech companies in terms of profitability, however.

What do you guys think?

Rio Tinto streamlines operations into three core divisions and refreshes its executive team in a bold bid to unlock long-term growth and shareholder returns.

https://preview.redd.it/p5v6491pzllf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97c4a4ea16ffa8c105c019078e2d5769952b31a3

Rio Tinto has entered a new phase in its long corporate history, unveiling a sweeping reorganization of its operating model and executive leadership team. Effective immediately, the mining giant will be streamlined into three world-class product groups: Iron Ore, Aluminium &amp; Lithium, and Copper. This strategic pivot is designed to sharpen accountability, maximize efficiencies, and accelerate shareholder returns.

Chief Executive Simon Trott described the changes as a turning point, underscoring the company’s mission to marry operational excellence with safe, sustainable, and profitable growth. The new structure, he said, will ensure Rio Tinto concentrates resources where they can deliver the greatest value while staying aligned with the global energy transition and long-term demand for critical minerals.

**Iron Ore Consolidation**

Iron Ore remains the backbone of Rio Tinto, and under the new model all of the company’s iron ore operations will be unified. This includes the powerhouse Pilbara mines in Western Australia, the Iron Ore Company of Canada, and, upon completion, the Simandou project in Guinea. Matthew Holcz has been appointed Chief Executive of the Iron Ore group, bringing over two decades of experience and leadership rooted in both international operations and the Pilbara heartland.

This consolidation is expected to unlock synergies across safety practices, technology deployment, and operational know-how. For shareholders, it means the proven strength of Rio’s established operations will be coupled with the long-term growth potential of Simandou, one of the world’s richest undeveloped iron ore deposits.

**Aluminium and Lithium Integration**

Rio Tinto is also folding its Lithium business into the Aluminium portfolio, creating a more streamlined division under the leadership of Jérôme Pécresse. The new Aluminium &amp; Lithium group will consist of Atlantic Operations Aluminium, Pacific Operations Aluminium, and Lithium. The rationale is straightforward: combine downstream exposure and processing capability while leveraging Rio’s Safe Production System, which has already driven efficiency gains in Aluminium.

Lithium, often called the “white gold” of the energy transition, sits at the heart of global electrification. By placing it alongside Aluminium, a cornerstone material for transportation and energy infrastructure, Rio is positioning itself to benefit from surging demand in both markets.

**Copper Positioned for Energy Transition**

Copper, led by Katie Jackson, remains a central pillar of Rio Tinto’s growth story. Copper demand is soaring globally due to its role in renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and modern infrastructure. Jackson’s mandate is to ramp up production at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, stabilize Kennecott in the United States, and advance strategic projects like Resolution in Arizona and Nuevo Cobre in Chile.

The division’s forward-looking strategy cements Rio’s position as a critical supplier to the global energy transition, making Copper not just a business unit but a growth engine for the company’s future.

**Leadership Changes and Transitions**

The restructuring brings both new appointments and departures. Longtime Rio veteran Sinead Kaufman will step down at the end of October after nearly three decades of service, a career marked by leadership in coal divestment and the establishment of lithium operations. Chief Executive Australia, Kellie Parker, will also transition out of her role, with external relations responsibilities moving to a newly created head of Australia position.

Simon Trott paid tribute to both leaders, highlighting their transformational contributions during critical phases in Rio’s corporate evolution.

**A Sharper Focus on Shareholder Value**

Trott’s message is clear: Rio Tinto is doubling down on disciplined capital deployment, operational excellence, and long-term value creation. The streamlined model is designed to push decision-making closer to the core of operations, while enhancing accountability and responsiveness to global market shifts.

Rio’s resilience in recent years, despite fluctuating commodity prices and global uncertainty, has set the stage for this transformation. With mid-term production growth targets on track, the company is now positioning itself to deliver stronger returns by focusing squarely on its most compelling opportunities.

**The Executive Committee Going Forward**

The updated executive committee reflects a balance of deep operational experience and global perspective. Alongside Trott, the team includes Bold Baatar as Chief Commercial Officer, Georgie Bezette as Chief People Officer, Peter Cunningham as Chief Financial Officer, Mark Davies as Chief Technical Officer, Isabelle Deschamps as Chief Legal, Governance and Corporate Affairs Officer, Matthew Holcz as Chief Executive of Iron Ore, Katie Jackson as Chief Executive of Copper, and Jérôme Pécresse as Chief Executive of Aluminium &amp; Lithium.

This group will now steer Rio Tinto through its next chapter, navigating both the challenges and the vast opportunities embedded in the global demand for critical minerals.

**Conclusion**

Rio Tinto’s reorganization is more than an internal reshuffle. It is a statement of intent from one of the world’s largest mining companies. By sharpening its focus on Iron Ore, Aluminium &amp; Lithium, and Copper, Rio is betting big on the commodities that will define the global economy for decades to come. With a refreshed executive team, a disciplined capital strategy, and a commitment to safety and sustainability, Rio is laying the foundation for a new era of growth and value creation.

The changes may be immediate, but their impact will play out over years as Rio seeks to align its vast resources with the future needs of the world. For investors, the message is unmistakable: Rio Tinto is streamlining to scale new heights in shareholder value.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.244902,2025-08-28T04:55:08,Rio Tinto,2025

Because there are so many people who lack experience, the work suffers. Depending on your luck, you may not have a senior to work with you for your first 3 months, which will be spent on a non business value electronic greeting/networking/clubs/hobbies system. Nobody uses these systems and it exists just to keep you busy.

Eventually you should be put into a proper development team, like your luckier peers. However the quality of your development lead and scrum master may vary.

Some will never interact with you at all, and expect you to resolve all your work yourself. Production incidents will occur and your scrum master will reprioritize your work, only to yell at you when your original work is not completed by the original deadline.

This abuse extends beyond juniors, extending towards seniors, where the entire team is too afraid to call out abuse, as they too have been abuse for raising issues.

**Sexual assault towards younger women**

If you're a young girl, expect sexual assault. Juniors and seniors will touch you without consent. If you raise this with management, they will say, ""this is due to cultural differences and you should be more inclusive"".

I know 5 cases just within our department within the last 2 months. You're not any safer in a city office than you are on site.

**Not enough work**

There is a lot of work, however nobody is willing to pay for it. Most of this work is outside the capabilities of a junior too. If you shomehow do manage to go onto a product, hope your lead developer is helpful.

Currently we have a bunch of juniors and seniors who mess around as they have no work to do. One guy just plays chess on his phone for most of the day while he waits for his project allocation.

**Forced into roles you lack training for**

Non programmers are forced to do programming, despite hiring making it clear you will not be in a software development role. When raising the issue with management, they will tell you to ""keep an open mind"".

**Closing thoughts**

If you somehow manage to withstand all this, the money is very good, and there are opportunities to learn cool things. You just need to be proactive to find these opportunities. Eventually however you will need to switch departments or companies to expand your skill set.

Staying here long term as a software developer is career suicide, as you don't work on complex tasks or with new technology.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.244921,2024-07-06T16:29:41,Rio Tinto,2024

I'm making a career change and getting into mining in the new year. I'm curious if anyone knows who bhp or rio use for labour hire and if that's my best option into either company. I've tried researching online but can't find much. Ive heard it's very difficult to get directly hired so I'm looking for my best bet to get up, get experience and make some connections. I've applied for a few jobs but never make it to an interview. I'm leaning more towards bhp and Olympic Dam as I'm based in SA.

Electricians powering BHP’s mines in the Pilbara will push for pay rises that ratchet their salaries up to $250,000 a year in a fight for a potentially standard-setting deal, just as rail technicians launch a new front against the mining giant to force it into a union agreement.

The Electrical Trades Union applied for orders against BHP late last week on behalf of about 170 rail maintenance workers to get the mining giant to the bargaining table on grounds that most workers want an agreement.

The Fair Work Commission legal action was followed by about 60 high-voltage workers, who maintain power lines for BHP mine sites and its mining town, endorsing claims on Monday for pay rises of 4.5 per cent a year over four years to lift base rates to $249,000 by 2028.

The claims are part of a broader push to reunionise the Pilbara for the first time in 30 years. Mining giants are pushing back with legal action and promises of pay rises averaging $25,000 to ward off unions.

So far, BHP is the only miner in the Pilbara that has been forced to bargain. But what emerges from its negotiations is expected to ramp up pressure on the hardline Rio Tinto, which is fighting unionisation efforts tooth and nail.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.244959,2025-06-11T09:22:18,Rio Tinto,2025

Actual intercepts. Actual team. And now, actual U.S. expansion.

Earlier this year, they rebranded themselves as Copper Quest instead of Interra Copper. It went beyond simple branding. It truly was a change. Behind the scenes, they were accumulating a portfolio of significant porphyry projects in British Columbia, totaling over 40,000 hectares spread across four distinct properties. Then they agreed to a high-grade copper-gold porphyry project in the United States. I've seen juniors waste money chasing irregularities. Drill data is real in CQX. They found 195 m of 0.466% Cu in one of their holes at the Stars project. It is an appropriate porphyry intercept.

Stars sit next to Stellar. It has mapped mineralization on the surface and a clean magnetic anomaly, but it hasn't been drilled yet. ArcWest's Rip earn-in already displays a number of porphyry systems. Next is Thane, a district-scale property spanning 20,658 hectares and situated between two significant mines, Mt. Milligan and Kemess. One of these could make a difference. When combined, they resemble a mid-tier portfolio's micro-cap counterpart.

Their entry into the U.S. was the main factor that convinced me to purchase 100,000 shares. They agreed to buy a copper-gold porphyry project in June after historic surface samples revealed 3.00% Cu, 0.8 g/t Au, and 25 g/t Ag. very close to the surface. within a Tier 1 jurisdiction. Additionally, the local technical staff is remaining on board. This is not a play about hoping and praying. They are filling the gap with actual data and operational support.

And the individuals in charge of this show? That was the clincher. The Aurelian team, which sold for more than $1 billion, included CEO Brian Thurston. Mike Ciricillo oversaw Glencore's whole copper business worldwide. Rich Leveille held senior positions at Phelps Dodge, Rio Tinto, and Freeport. Trevali was completely constructed by Mark Cruise. Career promoters are not what these guys are. They are geologists, capital markets operators, and real mine builders who understand how to advance projects.

3. **Took Trevali Mining from discovery into a Zinc producer**

1. **Managed and expanded production for Nunavut gold mine owned by Agnico Eagle (Jason Nickel)**  

More than half of the float is held by insiders. That's enormous. The majority of juniors fade into insignificance and many have less than 10% owned by insiders. The cap table is being guarded by these guys. They raised C$653K in August at a price of $0.075 per unit, with a two-year warrant of $0.15 each. Just money to make the plan a reality. Even after being fully diluted, there are still only about 54 million shares. It won't remain at a C$5M–C$6M market cap for long if news breaks, which it will.

Copper is poised for a squeeze on a macro level. The EV push is real, as everyone knows. The grids are overburdened. AI data centers are ravenous for metal. At the same time, copper reserves are falling to levels not seen in decades. The supply isn't keeping up. Large manufacturers are reducing capital expenditures.

In their first season back, Utah’s front office tried to create a home town feel by hiring former Royals player Amy Rodriguez (ARod) as Head Coach and building a roster filled with local college talent.

About 4 games into the season, Utah continued to build its roster with 3 new signings: Macey Fraser (NZ, former club Wellington Phoenix FC), Amandine Henry (FR, former club Angel City FC), and Ana Tejada (ESP, former club Real Sociedad). Fraser only made 4 appearances for the club with a consistent ankle injury and an extended excused absence for most of the season. While Henry brought noticeable experience and confidence to the pitch, she was unable to secure a consistent starting role for the team. Last but not least, Tejada quickly worked her way into the starting 11 as a defensive mid.

After 11 matches leaving the Royals with 1 win, 9 losses, and 1 tie, ARod was fired and newly appointed Assistant Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets was promoted to interim head coach. The team’s Goalkeeping coach was also fired and the team President was reassigned to a different project.

While many fans felt outraged at the sudden sacking of ARod, especially because it came right after a much improved look with the Royals tying the Portland Thorns, many have come to accept that this was the right move. Inside sources also indicate that Coenraets actually acted as head coach at that Portland game (his lineup, his strategy). Shortly after the big staffing moves, the league entered international break, and Utah made some major roster changes that enabled them to show strong in the Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup in which Utah settled at the top of their group and was one slot away from the finals. Here is a summary of the roster changes made during international break:

**Mina Tanaka**, FW (JPN, former club INAC Kobe Leonessa)

* Influence: As a seasoned international player, Tanaka was consistently able to help Utah transition into more favorable offensive positions. Tanaka also earned the MVP award for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup (pictured above).

**Claudia Zornoza**, MF (ESP, former club Real Madrid)

* Influence: Another seasoned international, Zornoza had a hugely positive impact on the team. Her coordination between the back line and the forwards created more scoring opportunities resulting in 3 assists and 2 goals over 10 games. Zornoza started for all 10 of her appearances, and was named to the NWSL Best XI of the Month for October/November 2024.

**Cloé Lacasse**, FW (CAN, former club Arsenal)

* Influence: Have you spotted a theme yet? Another seasoned international player for the Royals coming in making big moves, including the Club’s first hat trick and the first hat trick of the 2024 NWSL season. With 4 goals in 9 games, Lacasse became the Royals’ top scorer for the season. In her 9th appearance for the Royals, Lacasse suffered a devastating ACL rupture and MCL sprain, moving her to the season-ending injury list. Lacasse will continue her recovery and is expected to miss a significant portion (if not all) of the 2025 season.

**Other Major Injuries**

* **Imani Dorsey**, DF, ruptured achilles in the 2nd game of the season
* **Lauren Flynn**, DF, bilateral compartment syndrome in lower legs

**Standout Players**

**1. Mandy McGlynn**, GK - McGlynn had an incredible season earning her multiple call up’s to the USWNT

**2. Ally Sentnor** (Centaur), FW

Ally was the shining start for the first half of the Royals season in her first year of professional soccer. Earning the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year Award, captaining the USWNT at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2024 to 3rd place along with a Bronze Ball win, and scoring 2 goals in 3 games during her first SheBelieves Cup made Sentnor well-known across the League. Sentnor is definitely one to watch, and she will be a critical piece of the Royals' 2025 season. Fun fact: the announcer at America First Field accidentally announced ""Ally Cenatur"" throughout the game.

**3. Kate Del Fava (KDF)**, DF - With so many injuries to the team’s back line, KDF became the MVP of the season staying steady (playing every minute of the regular season!) and taking on a real leadership role for the team.

**In-season players out:**

* **Addisyn Merrick**, DF, to Carolina Ascent
* **Ify Onumonu**, FW, to Montpellier
* **Amandine Henry**, MF, to Deportivo Toluca
* **Frankie Tagliaferri**, MF, no new club announced

While nobody had super high hopes for a young and mostly unknown team and an untested coach, I don’t think anyone predicted such a poor first half of the season. Following the Summer Cup, however, Utah showed some serious promise, but ultimately ended at #11 and was unable to turn things around enough to qualify for the playoffs.

**\_\_\_**

# Offseason

**Players Out**

**Carly Nelson**, 27, GK

* Nelson was on an excused absence for most of the season and only played in 1 game for the Royals. Following her departure, she commented on a toxic culture at the Royals, and it is unknown if the dramatic mid-season switch up could have also been related to this.

**Cam Tucker**, 25, FW, Levante UD

**Zoë Burns**, 23, DF, Fleury

**Agnes Nyberg**, 24, MF, Rosenborg

**Michelle Vasconcelos**, 30, MF, Levante Badalona

**Hannah Betfort**, 26, F, North Carolina Courage

**Players In**

**KK Ream**, 15, FW, Utah Avalanche, contract - signed through 2027

* Ream has lots of experience playing with the Utah academies, including boys teams, and has extensive youth national cup experience

**Alex Loera**, 25, MF, Bay FC, trade - signed through 2027

* Loera excelled as a consistent started for the KC Current in the 2023 season, when she scored in the semifinal match of the playoffs, pushing the KC Current to the finals with a 2-0 win over Seattle. She then moved on to be expansion team Bay FC's first signing, but suffered an ACL injury early in the season.

**Mia Justus**, 22, GK, Texas (NCAA), contract - signed through 2027

* With over 100 saves in her final year at University of Texas, Justus set a new single season clean sheet record with 12 games. Justus started in 2 games at the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup.

**Ana Maria Guzmán**, 19, DF, Bayern Munich, on loan through 2025

* With her first call up to the Colombian senior national team in 2021 at age 16 and her most recent ending in injury, Guzmán is just starting her 4-year contract with Bayern Munich. At the beginning of her season in August 2024, she scored a brace, and is hoping to continue to grow and develop while on loan for Utah. Guzmán also represented Colombia in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup.

**Aisha Solórzano**, 26, FW, Tijuana, contract - signed through 2027

* Leaving Tijuana in the middle of a very successful season (16 goals in 16 games), Solórzano makes her way to Utah's offense, where the team hopes to capitalize on her finishing abilities.

**Tatumn Milazzo**, 26, DF, Chicago Stars, contract - signed through 2026

* As one of the few NWSL familiars joining Utah's 2025 roster, Milazzo's 70 career NWSL appearances indicate that she is an experienced and accomplished defender.

**Nuria Rábano**, 25, DF, Vfl Wolfsburg, transfer - signed through 2027 with an option

* Utah continued to expand its Spanish influence with its 3rd Spaniard with international team experience. As a left-back, Nuria adds depth to the Royals roster.

# 2025 Preview

**Realistic Best Case Scenario (5th)**

[Photo: https:\/\/equalizersoccer.com\/2024\/10\/24\/jimmy-coenraets-named-full-time-head-coach-of-royals-looks-to-build-on-recent-gains\/](https://preview.redd.it/32zt9prm6kme1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d351b4c6ae9edb8d57d682d7c6dc8f15e05f314e)

While the Royals were much more successful in the 2nd half of their inaugural season, some of their top players (Cloe Lacasse, Imani Dorsey, Paige Monaghan, Alex Loera, and Lauren Flynn) suffered injuries last season, and it is unclear where they are at in their recovery. With that in mind and a still very young roster, Utah will likely be fighting an uphill battle to make it into the playoffs. Realistically, this is possible, especially if the defense can continue holding strong while Zornoza partners with Tanaka, Sentnor, and Solorzano up top to strengthen the attack along the length of the field. While this team is probably not ready for the shield, its definitely possible for them to finish in the top 3rd of the rankings and make it into the playoffs.

**Realistic Worst Case Scenario (14th)**

[Photos: https:\/\/kslsports.com\/nwsl\/utah-royals\/utah-royals-manage-scoreless-draw-against-portland-thorns\/520029](https://preview.redd.it/jnzqv8y3akme1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae02239319c914de50e9c1d16e027d93f47981cb)

With existing injuries and some untested players new to the NWSL, the Royals could fail to connect and have significant gaps. Unfortunately, landing somewhere at the bottom of the table could be a very real possibility for this team.

**Realistic Most Probable Scenario (9th)**

Sooo close! This is a very different team from last year, but without any clear stand-out star signings, Utah will likely see another ""growth"" year. Hopefully, even if the team continues to experience growing pains, this year will at least be an opportunity to identify a core strategy and build talent around that. Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets has[ experience working with young teams](https://sonofgao.substack.com/p/utah-royals-hand-the-keys-over-to), and his influence and structure really enhanced the team's cohesion last year. With all the uncertainty, this team could really end up anywhere in the middle/bottom of the table.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.245138,2025-03-05T01:59:36,Rio Tinto,2025

659,1nehmof,$CQX: Why I Bought 1M Shares of Copper Quest,Temporary_Noise_4014,/r/Penny_Stocks/comments/1nehmof/cqx_why_i_bought_1m_shares_of_copper_quest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Penny_Stocks/comments/1nehmof/cqx_why_i_bought_1m_shares_of_copper_quest/,2,1,1757617791.0,"Although I've been around long enough to witness junior miners go through cycles of hype, occasionally you'll come across one that doesn't feel like the typical ""maybe drill, maybe promote"" narrative. That one for me was Copper Quest Exploration (CSE: CQX, OTC: IMIMF). I have witnessed numerous explorers attempt to ride the macro wave of copper. This one had a distinct feel. Actual land. Actual intercepts. Actual team. And now, actual U.S. expansion.

Earlier this year, they rebranded themselves as Copper Quest instead of Interra Copper. It went beyond simple branding. It truly was a change. Behind the scenes, they were accumulating a portfolio of significant porphyry projects in British Columbia, totaling over 40,000 hectares spread across four distinct properties. Then they agreed to a high-grade copper-gold porphyry project in the United States. I've seen juniors waste money chasing irregularities. Drill data is real in CQX. They found 195 m of 0.466% Cu in one of their holes at the Stars project. It is an appropriate porphyry intercept.

Stars sit next to Stellar. It has mapped mineralization on the surface and a clean magnetic anomaly, but it hasn't been drilled yet. ArcWest's Rip earn-in already displays a number of porphyry systems. Next is Thane, a district-scale property spanning 20,658 hectares and situated between two significant mines, Mt. Milligan and Kemess. One of these could make a difference. When combined, they resemble a mid-tier portfolio's micro-cap counterpart.

Their entry into the U.S. was the main factor that convinced me to purchase 100,000 shares. They agreed to buy a copper-gold porphyry project in June after historic surface samples revealed 3.00% Cu, 0.8 g/t Au, and 25 g/t Ag. very close to the surface. within a Tier 1 jurisdiction. Additionally, the local technical staff is remaining on board. This is not a play about hoping and praying. They are filling the gap with actual data and operational support.

And the individuals in charge of this show? That was the clincher. The Aurelian team, which sold for more than $1 billion, included CEO Brian Thurston. Mike Ciricillo oversaw Glencore's whole copper business worldwide. Rich Leveille held senior positions at Phelps Dodge, Rio Tinto, and Freeport. Trevali was completely constructed by Mark Cruise. Career promoters are not what these guys are. They are geologists, capital markets operators, and real mine builders who understand how to advance projects.

**Past Wins**

1. **Brian Thurston was President and CEO of Lion Energy Corp. from 2007 to 2011 and Sold to Lundin’s Africa Oil Corp.** 
2. **Aurelian Resources acquired by Kinross for 1.2B in 2008  (Brian Thurston)**  
3. **Took Trevali Mining from discovery into a Zinc producer**

1. **Managed and expanded production for Nunavut gold mine owned by Agnico Eagle (Jason Nickel)**  

More than half of the float is held by insiders. That's enormous. The majority of juniors fade into insignificance and many have less than 10% owned by insiders. The cap table is being guarded by these guys. They raised C$653K in August at a price of $0.075 per unit, with a two-year warrant of $0.15 each. Just money to make the plan a reality. Even after being fully diluted, there are still only about 54 million shares. It won't remain at a C$5M–C$6M market cap for long if news breaks, which it will.

Copper is poised for a squeeze on a macro level. The EV push is real, as everyone knows. The grids are overburdened. AI data centers are ravenous for metal. At the same time, copper reserves are falling to levels not seen in decades. The supply isn't keeping up. Large manufacturers are reducing capital expenditures. Furthermore, CQX and other juniors are sitting on the kind of optionality that majors will require.

This isn't a pump. It is faith. Not all copper names appeal to me. I perused the documents. If insider ownership is too low or Salaries too bloated, I quickly reject and move to the next stock.  News is something I keep up with. I look at the teams. All the boxes were checked with this one.

Frontier fortunes and investor risks collide in Canada’s untamed Yukon, where Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter dissects discovery, disaster, and opportunity.

https://preview.redd.it/gt7hxfnwezlf1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03cedca5cd4af2b846f592212e1d2a12b7869b54

The Yukon is a land of staggering contrasts, where towering peaks, rolling rivers, and dense pine forests hide an immense geological prize. For investors, this northern expanse of Canada represents both untapped promise and sobering cautionary tales. In his latest Rule Investment Newsletter, Rick Rule reminds readers why the Yukon has captivated explorers for generations and why disciplined investors should pay attention to the territory’s unfolding story.

**The Allure of Untapped Riches**

Yukon remains one of the least explored mining jurisdictions in the world. This is no small fact in an age when new large-scale discoveries are becoming rare. Over 20 million ounces of gold have been defined in a narrow stretch of the Tombstone Belt, placing the region alongside some of the world’s most promising exploration fronts. Banyan Gold and Snowline Gold alone have outlined deposits exceeding seven million ounces each, proof that Yukon can host not just one but several district-scale systems.

Investors are drawn to the scale. The idea that multiple five-million-ounce discoveries may lie hidden beneath Yukon’s rugged surface is intoxicating for majors searching for multi-decade projects. Rick Rule emphasizes that scarcity drives value. The global mining industry is desperate for new deposits, and Yukon continues to deliver.

**The Whiplash of Investor Sentiment**

But the path is never smooth. The bankruptcy of Victoria Gold following the heap leach failure at its Eagle mine in 2024 rattled investor confidence. Overnight, explorers across the territory saw their valuations collapse, not because of their own technical failings but because markets feared Yukon itself might be unworkable. Rule notes this cycle of euphoria and despair is the very fabric of resource investing. Weak hands exit in panic while disciplined capital waits patiently for clarity.

The report into Eagle’s collapse concluded that heap leaching was not fundamentally flawed, but poorly executed. That distinction matters. Banyan’s shift toward mill-based processing, focusing on higher-grade zones at Aurmac, was partly informed by this lesson. For investors, the rebound in Yukon explorer share prices after the initial shock illustrates a deeper truth: geology doesn’t change, sentiment does.

**Capital Flows Return**

Despite the turbulence, capital is flowing back into the territory. Yukon explorers raised nearly C$200 million in 2024 and are on track to match that pace this year. Rule’s own portfolio has benefitted. Rackla Metals and Sitka Gold have soared more than 400 percent in the past twelve months, a testament to the market’s hunger for early-stage discovery potential.

Majors are circling. B2Gold’s stake in Snowline, Agnico Eagle’s position in White Gold, and Rio Tinto’s strategic interest in Western Copper &amp; Gold demonstrate that the big players still view Yukon as fertile hunting ground. Yet Rule cautions that not every corporate investment turns into a mine. Goldcorp’s much-hyped acquisition of Kaminak’s Coffee project still sits undeveloped under Newmont’s ownership, now up for sale. Investors, Rule advises, must separate geological reality from market mythology.

**The Standout Projects**

Several companies emerge as central characters in Yukon’s investment story. Banyan Gold’s Aurmac, with 7.7 million ounces outlined, is pushing toward a mill-based PEA that could deliver 300,000 ounces of annual production. Snowline’s Valley deposit, with its high grades and extraordinary intercepts, is already being spoken of as one of Canada’s largest future mines. Rackla Metals is testing whether the Tombstone Belt’s golden reach stretches into the Northwest Territories. Sitka Gold, through aggressive drilling, is assembling a land package that could define a new district. Fireweed Metals, armed with U.S. Department of Defense funding, is pushing tungsten and zinc into the spotlight at Mactung and Macpass. Gladiator Metals is reviving Whitehorse’s forgotten copper belt. Western Copper’s Casino project, meanwhile, remains a giant waiting for infrastructure and cheap power to make it viable.

Rule is clear that scale, metallurgy, and location matter most. Projects with infrastructure advantages, high-grade cores, and district potential will draw the majors when consolidation sweeps through.

**The Infrastructure Dilemma**

Infrastructure is Yukon’s Achilles heel. Power shortages and road access remain critical obstacles. The territory’s hydro grid is stretched thin, forcing both Snowline and Banyan to model diesel-powered operations. Western Copper plans to use LNG for Casino, but the economics remain marginal compared to the cheap, clean power majors demand. Ottawa’s pledge to study a Yukon–British Columbia grid intertie is welcome, but billions of dollars and years of negotiation stand in the way.

Rule’s message is blunt: geology alone does not make a mine. Without roads, power, and First Nations alignment, even the richest deposits can languish. Investors must weigh these realities carefully.

**The Shadow of Victoria Gold**

Victoria’s downfall casts a long shadow. Once Yukon’s flagship producer, the company’s bankruptcy underscores both the risks and the stakes. Its Eagle mine, along with the Raven deposit and Brewery Creek, are now up for grabs through PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Whoever takes control will instantly become Yukon’s dominant player, with the power to reshape sentiment across the territory. Rule argues that if a deep-pocketed major steps in, it will be a vote of confidence in Yukon that lifts all boats.

The government has every incentive to make this happen. With Victoria gone, Yukon has lost its largest taxpayer. Federal transfers keep the territory afloat, but long-term sustainability requires mining revenues. A successful sale of Eagle would not only restore production but also reassure global investors that Yukon is open for business.

**Rick Rule’s Yukon Thesis**

Rick Rule has spent a career navigating the booms and busts of resource investing. His Yukon thesis distills to a simple idea: the territory is a frontier with world-class potential, but only disciplined investors will thrive. Those who buy when fear dominates, and sell when euphoria peaks, will capture the asymmetric rewards. Projects like Snowline, Banyan, Rackla, and Sitka may not all succeed, but even one more world-class discovery could be transformative.

Yukon, he argues, is not just a bet on geology but on human resilience, capital discipline, and the slow grind of infrastructure development. For investors willing to stomach volatility, it is precisely the kind of jurisdiction where fortunes are made.

**Conclusion**

The Yukon story is still being written. It is a place of giants and ghosts, of billion-dollar valuations and sudden bankruptcies, of soaring drill intercepts and stubborn logistical challenges. Rick Rule’s Investment Newsletter paints a vivid picture of both promise and peril. For those who can navigate sentiment swings and keep their eyes on the rocks beneath the tundra, Yukon remains one of the most compelling frontier plays on the planet.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.246181,2025-08-30T02:03:32,Rio Tinto,2025

It turns out the rich are like us in at least one way: they love a punt.

They have made hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, in their own companies, so many of the members of [The List – Australia’s Richest 250](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/wealth/rich-life/the-list-australias-richest-250-of-2025/news-story/87ad0818a37b7e909f61877915abf90d) have diversified their share portfolios.

Some don’t mind taking a risk on a speculative stock in the pursuit of striking proverbial gold.

Renowned veteran [prospector Mark Creasy](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/billionaire-prospector-mark-creasy-walks-away-from-deal-with-chinese-group/news-story/01aade283c9279f1db1509384599458e) has dozens of shareholdings in small junior miners with projects around the world. For him, it’s a case of sticking to the sector he knows best.

Others, like James Packer, made billions selling out of one industry – gambling – and [poured some of that fortune into another, like technology](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/james-packer-embraces-new-business-ventures-after-tumultuous-years/news-story/5c4e027d7d2ddbc09e9bc88378a90e60).

Whether its diversifying the portfolio or rolling the dice on a smaller company, these wealthy Australians are backing a wide range of listed companies across Australia, the US and London.

You’ve got to be in it to win it.

Here are some of the little-known stocks that Australia’s wealthy elite are dabbling in.

# Gina Rinehart

**Best known for: Hancock Prospecting**

**Also has shares in: Ballard Mining**

[Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/gina-rinehart-says-rio-tinto-chief-should-be-based-in-perth/news-story/4dd58c729976c7f2012a04bbd249ca57) has built a huge $2bn stock portfolio, consisting mostly of mining stocks and more recently index-hugging exchange-traded funds.

The Hancock holdings also include shares in US-listed stocks such as Tesla, Fox and Trump Media. Rinehart is a noted fan of US President Donald Trump.

Closer to home, Hancock has emerged as a major shareholder in newly listed gold explorer Ballard Mining, which has been spun out of ASX-listed Delta Lithium – Delta also counts Hancock as a shareholder. Ballard raised $30m to pay for a 130,000m drilling campaign at Mount Ida, in Western Australia’s Goldfields. It’s worth just $69m, with a return of just 2.7 per cent so far this year. Hancock owns 6.19 per cent.

# Gerry Harvey

Harvey has dabbled in plenty of stocks over the years, including several speculative mining plays, but has also backed a fellow retail success story in the New Zealand-based Briscoe Group.

[Headed by billionaire Rod Duke](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/rod-duke-from-shoes-salesman-at-16-to-retail-billionaire/news-story/76c132cc8d436924a179f3ee2e37ad5f), Briscoe comprises homewares stores and now Rebel Sports outlets. Its shares are up 20 per cent since January 1.

Mathieson has also pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into [trying to rescue Star](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/abercrombie-holds-all-the-cards-in-humms-takeover/news-story/73b8ee3d7cde9e1f087ccb74ddad15e5), and has long been a Mayne Pharma shareholder.

His investment company has also popped up on the share register of RAS, which provides horse racing data services. Last year, RAS struck a deal with Ed Craven’s [Stake.com](http://Stake.com) to provide racing data, a trading management platform, risk management services and customer and generosity management tools for Stake’s new horse racing betting business. The share price fell late last year but has recovered and is up 10 per cent since January (but over a year is down 24.6 per cent).

Morris started share registry services firm Computershare in 1978 and built it into an ASX-listed giant. It is worth $23.2bn, and has delivered a 59 per cent return for investors over the past year.

Morris maintains a large shareholding in the business and has extensive Queensland tourism assets, including the Townsville casino and the five-star Orpheus Island Lodge.

He also has shares in US data storage company Seagate. Worth $US32.8bn ($50.8bn), its shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq, have surged 72 per cent this year.

# James Packer

**Best known for: Crown Resorts**

**Also has shares in:** [**Monday.com**](http://Monday.com)

Among his biggest holdings, according to filings for his Consolidated Press Holdings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, are the likes of Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Shopify and Spotify.

Another holding is [Monday.com](http://Monday.com), an Israeli-based, cloud-based work management platform business. Its shares on the Nasdaq are up about 26 per cent since January 1, valuing the group at $US12.8bn.

# Alan Rydge

**Best known for: EVT, Carlton** 

**Also has shares in: Harvey Norman**

Alan Rydge has led EVT and Carlton Investments for 45 years. Picture: Milan Scepanovic

Billionaire Rydge’s wealth is mostly based on two ASX-listed companies he has led for 45 years: EVT Limited and Carlton Investments.

EVT, which stands for Entertainment, Ventures and Travel, is the former Amalgamated Holdings business Rydge worked for until taking over as chairman in 1980.

Carlton invests in EVT and blue-chip stocks such as the big four banks, Wesfarmers, Telstra and Rio Tinto. But Rydge also has been a long-term holder of Harvey Norman stock, which is up about 31 per cent over the past 12 months to be worth $7.3bn.

# Ed Craven 

**Best known for:** [**Stake.com**](http://Stake.com)

Nine Entertainment’s largest shareholder is, [according to a recent report in The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/nines-future-after-domain-sale-regional-media-magnate-plotting-takeover-bid/news-story/fc5785d03cd67cbd8be3882389720582), contemplating a play to take over the whole company – or at least build on his already substantial stake.

Gordon’s biggest private holding is his regional WIN Television business, but the 96-year-old has also dabbled in other listed shares over the years.

One is Tuas, headed by another billionaire in David Teoh. Tuas operates the low-cost Simba mobile phone brand in Singapore. ASX-listed Tuas is down about 14 per cent since January 1, but is up 31 per cent in the past 12 months, valuing the group at $2.5bn.

Harmanis founded nickel business Jubilee Mines in 1987. Harmanis attributes his timely sale of the business in a $3.1bn deal at the top of the market cycle in 2007 to a meditative revelation.

He is still dabbling in mining shares, including Talisman Mining, which he chairs.

Harmanis also has shares in Centaurus Metals, which is exploring for critical minerals in Brazil. Its shares have rallied this month after promising drilling results, valuing the explorer at $208m. Harmanis’s investment has delivered a 27 per cent return over the past year.

This entry is dedicated to presenting empirical evidence on overproduction and price wars, with a focus on China but also examining their repercussions on global economic sectors. Data is drawn from press sources (The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times) and reports from economic consultants and rating agencies. At the end, we provide some considerations.

# Real Estate Market and Construction in China

In China, there is widespread overproduction in the construction and real estate market, which threatens to drag down the entire economy. Overproduction is reflected in increased inventories of unsold homes, falling prices, and growing difficulties in the mortgage credit sector. In August 2023, the combined area of unsold homes was 648 million square meters, equivalent to 7.2 million homes, according to Reuters (assuming an average household size of 90 square meters). This does not account for numerous residential projects that were sold but remain unfinished due to cash flow problems, or homes purchased by speculators during the last market surge in 2016 that remain unoccupied.

According to official data, at the end of April 2024, China had 391 million square meters of completed but unsold housing—equivalent to 6.6 Manhattans. Including homes still under construction, the total inventory of unsold housing is estimated to reach 2.9 billion square meters by the end of 2024, nearly double the area of London.

In May 2024, Goldman Sachs estimated the total value of unsold homes, unfinished projects, and unused land in China at about $4.1 trillion ([China is trying to end its ‘epic’ property crisis. The hard work is just beginning | CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/21/economy/china-property-crisis-stimulus-challenges-intl-hnk/index.html)).

Given the excess supply, housing sales dropped by 20% between January and April 2024, property investment fell by 9.8%, and developers' fundraising declined by 24.9%.

https://preview.redd.it/1y5c5t20jeee1.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0634a05e3b3c701a819d1c516736812f2face0a3

Although in November the fall in prices slowed down (in year-on-year terms the prices of new homes fell 4.3%, 0.3 percentage points less than in October), the situation remains extremely fragile.

China's central bank has provided a credit facility of up to 300 billion yuan ($41 billion), which can result in commercial banks financing purchases by state-owned enterprises worth 500 billion yuan; equivalent to 0.4% of the country's GDP. The rating agency Moody points out that they are ""a drop in the ocean"" since it can only finance purchases for 4% of the value of the existing stock of houses.

We recall that investment in construction and real estate went from representing 5% of GDP in 1995, to more than 13% in 2019. In that year, more than 70% was dedicated to residential construction. It has been calculated that a 20% drop in real estate activity could lead to a drop in China's gross domestic product of between 5 and 10%, even without the amplification of a banking crisis. Between 2013 and 2018, investment in the real estate sector increased by 30% and the household leverage ratio went from 33% to 66% ([Peak China Housing\_2020\_08\_12](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27697/w27697.pdf)). From 2002 onwards, house prices increased more than sixfold. By international comparison, China's real estate boom is unprecedented. Price-to-income ratios in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen exceed 40, compared to London, 22 and New York, 12. From 2014 to 2018, the average annual growth of credit to the real estate sector was 20%, while credit to industry grew at 6%.

""How many empty houses are there now? Each expert gives a different number, with the most extreme believing that the current number of empty houses is enough for 3 billion people to have housing,"" explains He Keng, former director of the Bureau of Statistics ([Even 1.4 billion people can't fill all of China's vacant homes, ex-official admits | CNN Business](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/23/business/china-too-many-homes-for-1-4-billion-people-intl-hnk/index.html)).

Builders, painters, real estate agents, small businesses, and banks are owed billions of dollars. Many developers are on the verge of bankruptcy. The bankruptcy of Evergrande, a giant real estate developer, with a debt of US$300,000 million that it could not restructure, is a precedent. The firm Rhodium Group estimates that all liabilities taken by the real estate sector, including loans and bonds, reach 10 trillion dollars, of which only a small part has been recognized ([China Has a Plan for Its Housing Crisis. Here's Why It's Not Enough. – The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/business/china-property-crisis.html)).

Excessive concentration in real estate industries has created many problems. Banks rely on land and real estate holdings as the main collateral to secure loans. Therefore, they provide more credit to land-owning firms, restricting credit to landless firms. On the other hand, rising house prices also induced companies whose core business is not related to real estate activity to invest in land, shifting resources from other areas such as trade, manufacturing, and technological innovations.

Local governments are also heavily engaged in real estate activity. On the one hand, land sales, driven by a rising housing market, constitute the main source of local tax revenue. On the other hand, local officials are promoted, or relegated, depending on their ability to generate economic growth and the construction activity itself represents a measurable economic product.

In September 2024, the Central Bank of China cut the interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, decreased the contribution needed to obtain a real estate loan and cut mortgage rates"" (*La Nación*, 8/10/2024). However, investment in the sector continued to fall: ""Real estate investment in China fell 10.2% in the first seven months of 2024 compared to the previous year, after declining 10.1% between January and June. If we talk about property sales by built area between January and July, these fell 18.6% compared to the previous year, indicated the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)."" One expression of the crisis is that the enrollment of young people in civil engineering careers is falling. ([China runs out of civil engineers: symptom of a deeper crisis (panampost.com)](https://panampost.com/oriana-rivas/2024/10/07/china-se-queda-sin-ingenieros-civiles-sintoma-de-una-crisis-mas-profunda/). The prospect of a gigantic financial crisis, dragging the economy into depression, is not a fantasy.

**Overproduction and deflation in China, according to** ***The Economist***

""From Apple to Starbucks. The dreams of Western companies in China are fading"", *The Economist*, reproduced in *La Nación*, 21/12/2024.

""In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, less than half of respondents said they were optimistic about the prospects for their business in China over the next five years, an all-time low. On Dec. 4, General Motors (GM) said it would reduce the value of its once-thriving companies in the country and close some of its factories. (…)

""Sales in China by U.S. and European listed companies peaked at $670 billion in 2021, accounting for 15% of those companies' total revenues. However, things have since gotten worse. Last year, sales fell to $650 billion and its share of total revenue fell to 14 percent. This year it has shown no signs of improvement. Of those companies reporting quarterly sales in China, nearly half saw their revenue decline, compared with last year.

Companies are facing declining sales in the country, ranging from Apple and Volkswagen to Starbucks and luxury brand conglomerate LVMH."" (…)

""One reason for the poor corporate performance is the stagnation of the Chinese economy. A housing crisis has sent home prices tumbling across the country and caused consumers to adjust their spending. (…) Property sales are still falling compared to last year or will likely continue to do so well into 2025. Despite the government's promises to stimulate consumption, demand indicators are in decline.

Deflationary pressure is affecting all companies in China, not just foreign ones... 27% of Chinese industrial companies were posting losses at the end of October. *Oversupply in various industries, from electric vehicles (EVs) to building materials has led to fierce price wars*. GM CEO Mary Barra has blamed a ""race to the bottom"" for the company's struggles to make money in the country. (…)

In many industries, Western companies no longer enjoy the technological advantage they once had over their Chinese rivals. Chinese industrial robot manufacturers now supply almost half of the local market, up from less than a third share in 2020."" After referring to the competition Apple is facing for Huawei's production of smartphones, the note continues: ""Electric vehicles produced by BYD, NIO and other automakers are not only much cheaper than Western ones, but they are full of the smart technology that local consumers want. When the Chinese market was still expanding, Western companies were able to increase their sales, even at a time when they were losing market share. Today they no longer have that luxury"":

In this scenario, the measures that governments are taking are added. ""On December 2, the U.S. introduced new restrictions on the sale of chip-making tools to certain Chinese companies... This will affect U.S. semiconductor equipment manufacturers. (…) “… the list of companies exposed to geopolitical conflicts is getting bigger.""

**Overproduction and deflation in China, according to TWSJ**

Nota en, “Prices Won’t Stop Falling in China, and Beijing Is Grasping for Solutions”, Hannah Miao, *The Wall Street Journal* 14/12/2024,[Prices Won’t Stop Falling in China, and Beijing Is Grasping for Solutions](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/prices-won-t-stop-falling-in-china-and-beijing-is-grasping-for-solutions/ar-AA1vQ2J2?ocid=BingNewsSerp).

""The country that invented paper is making too much paper. So Shandong Chenming Paper, one of the largest paper manufacturers, did what every company facing overcapacity could do: it lowered prices to offload more supply as it tried to ride out the storm. But their losses increased. Last month, the company said it had accumulated $250 million in overdue debt. Creditors sued her and some of the company's bank accounts were frozen.

The papermaker's woes are just one of the latest signs of the havoc wreaked by falling prices in China as mills struggle to cope with overcapacity and weak demand.

The note notes that Chinese leaders pledged this week to stimulate the economy and boost government borrowing. But pressure continues to mount on the government to take more decisive action to prevent a deflationary spiral into a self-inflicting slump that would push China into a long-term recession.

""The prices of goods leaving Chinese factories have fallen, in year-on-year terms, for 26 consecutive months; in November they fell 2.5% from November 2023, and there are few signs that they will turn upwards anytime soon. China's gross product deflator, which is a broader gauge of price levels in the economy, has been in negative territory for six consecutive quarters, the longest span since the late 1990s."" (…)

A potential new trade war with President-elect Donald Trump could make it harder for China to unload excess production capacity on the U.S., leaving it with more goods than it can absorb in its domestic market. Fear of deflation is taking root in China. *As falling prices erode profitability, companies postpone investments or lay off workers, leading more people to cut back on spending* (emphasis ours). Others might postpone purchases because they think prices can still fall further. It becomes a vicious circle.

China's consumer price index is still above zero, but only 0.2% in November from November last year. In the US the increase was 2.7%. China's interest rate is well below the roughly 2% level that most banks consider healthy for their economies.

Many economists are closely watching the Producer Price Index data — it captures the price level at firms — given the country's reliance on industry as an engine of growth.

There are signs that China's economy is regaining some strength, but the government's policies so far do not appear to have encouraged prices. One reason is that those policies focused primarily on fending off immediate financial risks rather than triggering a sustained increase in consumer spending. On the other hand, Beijing has been providing loans and subsidies to Chinese factories. That supports growth but exacerbates the problem of oversupply, adding to the downward pressure on prices.""

Returning to the situation of the paper and cardboard industry, in October production grew 10% compared to the same month in 2023, while the prices of paper products at the exit of the factories have been falling, in year-on-year terms, since October 2022.

Other industries have followed a similar path. William Li, CEO of NIO, an electric car maker, said at a meeting with analysts in September that China's internal combustion engine vehicle makers have entered an unsustainable cycle, or vicious cycle, of price cuts, hurting profits. Vehicle production in China continues to increase. Some economists expect producer prices to remain in negative territory for at least the next year.

The problem is that once lower price expectations take hold, it's hard to turn them around. Japan experienced this in the 1990s, when the crash of the housing and stock market bubble left consumers and businesses focused on paying down debt rather than spending or investing, even as policymakers lowered interest rates to virtually zero. That led to nearly three decades of weak growth and persistent deflation. Unfavorable demographics didn't help.

One sign of how much concern investors are viewing China's deflation problem with is that yields on 30-year bonds recently slipped below Japan's for the first time since 2006.

In other periods of deflation, China took more drastic measures. After the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, when factory prices fell for 31 months, China launched a painful process to curb overcapacity. Under the government of then-premier Zhu Rongji, many state-owned enterprises were closed or downsized, leading to mass layoffs. Factory prices also fell between 2012 and 2016, spurred by overproduction in products such as tires and solar panels. At that time, the Chinese government closed factories. A key difference from what is happening today is that the Chinese economy is expanding at a slower rate than in the past. The country's GDP grew at an annual rate of approximately 7% in 2015 and 2016. In the third quarter of 2024, the economy expanded at a year-over-year rate of 4.6%, and many economists think that growth this year will be lower.""

The memo quotes a textile businesswoman as saying that the new tariffs under Trump could add pressure. His company had already had to lower prices to compete with many other companies that are offering similar products, forcing the workforce down from 600 workers before the Covid-19 pandemic, to about 400 today.

**Particular cases**

***Car***

According to Keith Bradsher in the *New York Times* 23/04/2024, China has more than 100 companies with the capacity to manufacture about 40 million combustion engine cars annually. This is approximately half of what the market absorbs (about 90 million). Many plants to manufacture combustion cars are operating with a lot of unused capacity and others have completely stopped production. The competition is not only for the Chinese market. China has become the world's largest exporter of automobiles. A significant part of that export is internal combustion cars that the Chinese market does not buy. Hence the strong pressure from Chinese car exports in European and other markets.

On the other hand, electric vehicle manufacturers are investing in new plants. But demand has slowed down, largely as a result of the crisis in the real estate sector. So China also has overcapacity in electric vehicles, although it is less than in combustion vehicles. Price cuts are at the center of competition between companies such as Tesla, BYD, VW, GM, Li auto.

The overproduction of combustion engine cars is explained both by heavy investments in these plants during the second decade of 2000, and by the drop in demand: sales fell from 28.3 million units in 2017 to 17.7 million in 2023, the year Hyundai opened its plant in Chongqing. That drop is equivalent to the entire European car market in 2023. Hyundai's sales fell 69% from 2017. The company put the plant up for sale, but there were no buyers. He eventually sold the land and buildings for a fraction (20%) of what they had cost.

Other companies, such as Ford, reduced their production to a small fraction of their capacity. To be profitable, automotive plants would need to operate at 80% or more capacity. With new electric car factories opening and few of the old ones closing, capacity utilization in the industry fell to 65% in the first three months of 2024 from 75% last year and 80% or more before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics (['It is desolate': China's glut of unused car factories | Sinoreporter.com](https://sinoreporter.com/articles/81481/#:~:text=China%20has%20more%20than%20100%20factories%20with%20the,Bill%20Russo%2C%20an%20electric%20car%20consultant%20in%20Shanghai.)).

Chinese companies are on the rise and gaining markets from their European and American competitors. In the third quarter of 2024, BYD was the sixth-largest manufacturer, with production up 38% year-on-year. In the quarter, the company sold 1.13 million units. It is close to Stellantis (Chrysler, Fiat) which sold 1.17 million, and GM, 1.15 million. The growth of this group has been very fast. In 2020 it sold 427,300 units; in 2023 it sold 2.89 million units, surpassing Volkswagen. Analysts believe that if it continues at this rate of growth, by the end of 2025 it would be surpassing Honda, Ford and possibly GM. BYD produces all-electric and hybrid cars. In electric cars in the third quarter, BYD was only 19,500 units below Tesla. The growth of market share is based on price competition, thanks to lower production costs.

Another company on the rise is the Geely Group, with a growth of 20%, year-on-year. Their market share was reduced by, among others, the Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, GM and Honda. For the first time, Chinese manufacturers sold more cars than European ones. The share of Chinese brands in the global market went from 20.8% in Q3 2023 to 23.6&amp; in Q3 2024. As for electric cars, China went from exporting $400 million in 2019 to $34 billion in 2023, with three of the world's four largest producers.

Also on the situation in the branch, *The Economist* says: ""... in China, European companies are losing out to their domestic rivals. The world's largest car market has long been a major source of profit for the European automotive industry. These days are coming to an end. According to UBS bank, the market share of foreign brands has fallen from 63% to 37% today... VW has been particularly hard hit. Previously, the largest car company in China by a wide margin, its market share dropped from 19% in 2019 to 14% today."" German luxury car manufacturers, such as BMW, Mercedes and Porsche are also losing ground (reproduced in *La Nación*, 14/12/2024).

The price war intensifies, and with them geopolitical tensions increase, as well as capital's attempts to increase the exploitation of labor. Volkswagen wants to cut the wages of its workers in Germany by 10%, and close plants. Some 100,000 workers went on strike in early December, rejecting the company's plans. On October 18, workers at Stellantis, in Italy, went on strike in protest at the drop in production; According to the union, the company plans to produce half a million units in 2024, against 751,000 in 2023. More generally, with the price war, protectionist measures are on the rise and geopolitical tensions are increasing.

***Lithium batteries***

Overcapacity has emerged throughout the entire supply chain for car construction as demand cooled. Prices of key battery raw materials have continued to fall after the market was hit by excessive supply levels. This is particularly pronounced in lithium; its price has collapsed by 70% in the last year.

On the other hand, the production capacity of batteries for electric cars in China has far exceeded domestic demand, reaching 2000 GWh (GWh, Gigawat hour, is a unit of energy that represents 1000 million watt-hours and is equal to 1 million kilowatt-hours) in 2023, while total capacity utilization has oscillated below 50% since 2019. In 2023, only 20 out of 77 automakers achieved a utilization rate above 60% ([2024-03-21-Automotive-AZ.pdf](https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/economic-research/publications/specials/en/2024/march/2024-03-21-Automotive-AZ.pdf)).

***Steel***

The global steel industry is grappling with overcapacity. Overcapacity is the biggest problem facing the industry globally, due to the significant increase in production capacity over the past two decades (""Steel overcapacity – a global problem"", Himanshu Mishra, 24 July 2023, [Steel overcapacity: A global problem | Acuity Knowledge Partners](https://www.acuitykp.com/blog/steel-overcapacity-a-global-problem/)). Amid the challenge of overcapacity, demand has weakened since 2021, exacerbating the problem. Global production capacity has increased by 34.7 million tonnes in 2023, and utilization is expected to increase by 2.9 million. The OECD estimated a global capacity of 2532.9 million tonnes by 2024, and a utilisation of 2031.5 million. The steel sector would continue to experience substantial increases in steel-producing capacity in the coming years if ongoing projects become operational.

""Economic fluctuations and uncertainty significantly impact steel demand, leading to an imbalance between capacity and production. *In addition, intense competition among steel-producing nations often triggers a race to increase production capacity, exacerbating the problem of overcapacity*."" However, steel prices rose due to the US and EU sanctions imposed on exports from Russia. Due to rising gas and energy prices in Europe, weak demand and a negative outlook, ArcelorMittal, the world's second-largest producer, closed one of the two blast furnaces at its steel production plant in Bremen, Germany. A China Baowu Group and Nippon Steel smelter was shut down due to soaring energy costs and weak demand. Demand has weakened as automakers and construction have reduced their output. ""Resolving global excess capacity is key to Steel market recovery: OECD"", 17 September 2024, [Resolving global excess capacity is key to steel market recovery: OECD – EUROMETAL](https://eurometal.net/resolving-global-excess-capacity-is-key-to-steel-market-recovery-oecd/)).

""The gap between global steel production capacity and global steel demand is growing rapidly... The gap was 551 million metric tons in 2023 and is forecast to be around 630 million by 2024-2026. The OECD also expects overcapacities to increase sharply in the coming years. It expects that in 2006 new capacities of 158 million tonnes could be in operation. China alone has increased its steel exports by 40% in 2023. Chinese export numbers are approaching the peak values of 2016 (""Overcapacity in Steel China's Role in a Global Problem"" Lucas Brun, September 2016, [OvercapacityReport2016\_R3.pdf (americanmanufacturing.org](https://www.americanmanufacturing.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OvercapacityReport2016_R3.pdf)).

The global steel branch is once again in a situation of overcapacity. Mainly driven by China's expansion since 2000. Chinese industry has a production capacity of 2.3 billion tonnes when 1.5 billion tonnes are needed to meet demand. The result is a global steel industry with unviable levels of profit and an influx of cheap steel into the global market that negatively affects businesses, workers and the global trade regime. China has vowed to reduce overcapacity. But it has not reduced it. Since 2007, when overcapacity became apparent in its own documents, it has added another 552 million tons, equivalent to seven times U.S. steel production.

The last time there was significant overcapacity in the global steel industry was in the 1970s and 1980s, when European countries cut subsidies, tackled unemployment and found a way to boost market-based competition. In the case of China, eliminating overcapacity is more difficult given the weight of state-owned enterprises. Steel production capacity averaged 1000 million metric tons between 1980 and 1994; then it gradually grew reaching 1,056 MT in 2000; and accelerated after 2001 to reach 2,371 million in 2015. The world has been adding capacity for more than a decade equivalent to annual steel production in the U.S. Most of this overcapacity is due to China. Overcapacity exceeded 500 million tonnes for the first time in 2009.

Overcapacity – the difference between potential output and current output – is caused by multiple factors, including overinvestment and weak demand. The effect is that profits are lowered or eliminated.

Steel production capacity averaged 1000 million metric tons between 1980 and 1994; then it gradually grew reaching 1,056 MT in 2000; and accelerated after 2001 to reach 2,371 million in 2015. The world has been adding capacity for more than a decade equivalent to annual steel production in the U.S.

""The global overcapacity of the steel industry was estimated at 543 million tons in 2023; it is 70 times more than the market in Great Britain. Southeast Asia and the Middle East have witnessed rapid expansions in steel production, largely financed by the state, and do not reflect domestic demand levels.""

Demand for steel in China is weakening, with some production spilling over into exports. In 2024 alone, it is expected to export 100 million tons. China's exports increased 20% in the first half of 2024, following a 38% increase in 2023. In Southeast Asia and the Middle East, capacity continues to increase at a high rate. Protectionism is on the rise. ([New bold policies needed to tackle steel imports and ensure Government sees return on investments – UK Steel](https://www.uksteel.org/steel-news-2024/new-report-trade-policy-must-uphold-fair-competition-for-uk-steel-makers-at-time-of-rising-global-excess-capacity#:~:text=Global%20steel%20excess%20capacity%20in%202023%20was%20estimated,furnaces%20which%20do%20not%20reflect%20domestic%20demand%20levels.)).

On the other hand, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, in particular, the crisis in the construction and real estate sector, has slowed down demand for steel. Naturally, so does the demand for iron ore (which is used for steel production).

With the construction boom, prices and profits of mining companies increased. Australia's Rio Tinto and Fortescue, Brazil's Vale, and Anglo-Australia's BHP all made big profits, and strongly increased their capacity. But now they are feeling weakening demand and some oversupply (BHP and Vale broke extraction records in the first half of 2024). In addition, supply is expected to continue to increase over the next five years, as new production enters the market. With the result of falling prices and declining profits.

***Petrochemistry***

Petrochemical producers in Europe and Asia are in survival mode as years of expanding capacity in the Chinese market and high energy costs in Europe have depressed margins for two straight years.

The weakness of the sector is worrying for a global naphtha and diesel industry that faces the prospect of a fall in demand for transport fuel in the coming years, due to the transition in energy. Large producers in Asia and Europe are selling off assets, closing older plants and retrofitting facilities to use cheaper feedstocks such as ethane instead of naphtha to cut costs. The oversupply is expected to persist for years as new plants are still opening in the Middle East and China, even as China's economy sputters. (""Petrochemical makers battle global glut"" Mohi Narayan and Joyce Lee, 9/08/2024, Reuters).

Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that about 24% of global petrochemical capacity is in danger of closure by 2028, amid weak margins. ""We expect rationalization to continue in Europe and Asia in this cycle,"" says Eren Cetinkaya, of McKinsey &amp; Company. It anticipates that the current recession will last longer than the typical five to seven years due to prolonged capacity building, especially in China.""

""Since 2022 a number of factors have made the business climate more difficult, including falling domestic demand as well as drastic oversupply given new production facilities launched in China and elsewhere in Asia,"" Mitsui Chemicals said in a statement in April.

France's ExxonMobil Chemical announced in April that it would turn off the steam cracker and shut down chemical production at Gravenchon this year, adding that the site has lost more than 500 million euros since 2018 and remains uncompetitive.

Taiwanese giant Formosa Petrochemical this year has been operating only one of its three naphtha crackers. The company has kept the other two crackers offline because of weak demand and unhealthy margins, a spokesman said. The company does not plan to make any new investments in the near future due to challenging market conditions, a company official said. Japan's Mitsui Chemicals announced in April its decision to close its Ichihara phenol plant by 2026. In October, it will close its polyethylene terephthalate plant in Iwakuni. It is also considering decreasing toluene dissociyanate production at Omuta in 2025 and is considering closing the Anegasaki plant in 2027.

The Petronas and Saudi Aramco joint venture has kept its 1.2 million tonnes per year naphtha cracker closed since it was shut down for maintenance at the start of the year. The CEO's office reported that there is no date for restarting the cracker. Sabic, 70 percent owned by Aramco, announced in April that it plans to permanently close a No. 3 cracker at its plant in Geleen, the Netherlands.

2023 saw a significant increase in capacity. For example, in ethylene, additional capacity of about 10 million tonnes per year was added, reducing capacity utilization by about 80 per cent. This situation is likely to persist for the foreseeable future. Construction continues and projects continue to be announced, such as new permits in China.

Other value chains in petrochemicals follow similar trends: in 2023, 11 million tons of propylene production capacity are added, and 12 million tons of benzene and para-xylene, resulting in the lowest capacity utilization rate in 10 years. Overproduction also affects *downstream* products.

In Europe, companies have dealt with worse market conditions due to lower prices, rearranging input chain volumes, and high energy prices. In Asia, substantial overcapacity and weak demand led to negative margins in important value chains, such as ethylene, polyethylene and polypropylene (Petrochemicals review: Where we are now and where we're going"", Eren Cetinkaya and Manuel Prieto, McKinsey &amp; Company, 31/05/2024). [Petrochemical companies may see a return to normal | McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/chemicals/our-insights/petrochemicals-review-where-we-are-now-and-where-were-going)).

***Cement***

Global excess cement production capacity could easily reach 1 billion tonnes by 2024, meaning that almost a third of global cement production capacity would be unused. With China moving from importer to exporter, FOB export prices will continue to fall. ([Global Cement Industry Outlook: Trends and Forecasts – World Cement Association](https://worldcementassociation.org/blog/news/global-cement-industry-outlook-trends-and-forecasts)).

***Solar panels***

Overproduction led to a 42% drop in prices, a level 60% lower than the cost of comparable products made in the US. However, large producers in China continue to build factories, backed by provincial and local subsidies. By the end of 2023, China had the capacity to build 861 gigawatts of solar modules per year, more than double the total installed capacity of 390 million gigawatts. Another 500 to 600 gigawatts of annual capacity are planned to be available this year (2024). That's enough to supply global demand through 2032, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. The capacity utilization rate in the solar PV industry fell from 78% in 2019 to 57% in 2022. In March 2023, Longi Green Energy Technology, the world's largest producer of solar cells, announced the layoff of thousands of workers, due to overcapacity and low prices. The average capacity utilization of battery plants in China fell from 51% in 2022 to 43% in 2023, according to Bloomberg.

**Some final considerations.**

First, overproduction is not an uncommon phenomenon. Marx and Engels' expression of the ""epidemic of overproduction"" (in *The Communist Manifesto*) applies entirely to many branches of the Chinese and world economy.

Secondly, the price war remains a characteristic phenomenon of capitalism. Also the fact that capital does not dominate production. The fundamental point is that the laws of commodity production ""are imposed on the individual producer in the form of constraining laws of competition... (…) They are imposed... without the participation of the producers, against the producers... *The product dominates the producers*"" (p. 269, *Anti-Dühring*; emphasis added).

Third, the fall in prices associated with overproduction must be distinguished from the fall in producer prices caused by increases in productivity in this or that branch. When there is overproduction, prices fall because there are difficulties in realizing the value generated by the worker. We are then facing a crisis of realization. From the point of view of the law of labour value, it means that society has invested in that branch more than the socially necessary labour time (see *Capital*, ch. 3 t. 1). Therefore, this fall in market prices leads to a fall in profits, and in the rate of profit. The fall in investment is, in this scenario, a natural consequence.

Fourth, overproduction and falling prices are the basis of financial crises, and the eventual collapse, or recession, of the economy.

Fifthly, we confirm what Engels had observed at the end of the nineteenth century: that in fundamental branches of the economy there can be overproduction for long periods of time. Leading to equally extended periods of weak growth.

Finally, the price wars that are taking place are expressed in the adoption of protectionist measures; increased customs barriers; exacerbation of geopolitical tensions; renewed offensives against the working class to make companies ""competitive""; and the possibility of open trade wars.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.246477,2025-01-22T06:54:29,Rio Tinto,2025

# 2024 Season Review 

The 2024 NWSL season saw the return of the Utah Royals, originally founded in 2017 and ultimately relocated to Kansas City in 2020 following owner controversy. In their first season back, Utah’s front office tried to create a home town feel by hiring former Royals player Amy Rodriguez (ARod) as Head Coach and building a roster filled with local college talent.

About 4 games into the season, Utah continued to build its roster with 3 new signings: Macey Fraser (NZ, former club Wellington Phoenix FC), Amandine Henry (FR, former club Angel City FC), and Ana Tejada (ESP, former club Real Sociedad). Fraser only made 4 appearances for the club with a consistent ankle injury and an extended excused absence for most of the season. While Henry brought noticeable experience and confidence to the pitch, she was unable to secure a consistent starting role for the team. Last but not least, Tejada quickly worked her way into the starting 11 as a defensive mid.

After 11 matches leaving the Royals with 1 win, 9 losses, and 1 tie, ARod was fired and newly appointed Assistant Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets was promoted to interim head coach. The team’s Goalkeeping coach was also fired and the team President was reassigned to a different project.

While many fans felt outraged at the sudden sacking of ARod, especially because it came right after a much improved look with the Royals tying the Portland Thorns, many have come to accept that this was the right move. Inside sources also indicate that Coenraets actually acted as head coach at that Portland game (his lineup, his strategy). Shortly after the big staffing moves, the league entered international break, and Utah made some major roster changes that enabled them to show strong in the Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup in which Utah settled at the top of their group and was one slot away from the finals. Here is a summary of the roster changes made during international break:

[Photo: https:\/\/www.kget.com\/sports\/ap-japan-beats-u-s-2-1-for-shebelieves-cup-womens-soccer-title\/](https://preview.redd.it/oigjk2wmyjme1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b32e4f61bbfe0a0cc37d5db21503325a28a5f5e8)

**Mina Tanaka**, FW (JPN, former club INAC Kobe Leonessa)

* Influence: As a seasoned international player, Tanaka was consistently able to help Utah transition into more favorable offensive positions. Tanaka also earned the MVP award for the 2025 SheBelieves Cup (pictured above).

[Photo: https:\/\/www.rsl.com\/utahroyals\/players\/claudia-zornoza\/](https://preview.redd.it/y9xinnqayjme1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8902c0e19da4557157dba6325d22d934dd16fc69)

**Claudia Zornoza**, MF (ESP, former club Real Madrid)

* Influence: Another seasoned international, Zornoza had a hugely positive impact on the team. Her coordination between the back line and the forwards created more scoring opportunities resulting in 3 assists and 2 goals over 10 games. Zornoza started for all 10 of her appearances, and was named to the NWSL Best XI of the Month for October/November 2024.

**Cloé Lacasse**, FW (CAN, former club Arsenal)

* Influence: Have you spotted a theme yet? Another seasoned international player for the Royals coming in making big moves, including the Club’s first hat trick and the first hat trick of the 2024 NWSL season. With 4 goals in 9 games, Lacasse became the Royals’ top scorer for the season. In her 9th appearance for the Royals, Lacasse suffered a devastating ACL rupture and MCL sprain, moving her to the season-ending injury list. Lacasse will continue her recovery and is expected to miss a significant portion (if not all) of the 2025 season.

**Other Major Injuries**

* **Imani Dorsey**, DF, ruptured achilles in the 2nd game of the season
* **Lauren Flynn**, DF, bilateral compartment syndrome in lower legs

**Standout Players**

**1. Mandy McGlynn**, GK - McGlynn had an incredible season earning her multiple call up’s to the USWNT

[Photo: https:\/\/www.rsl.com\/utahroyals\/kit-launch2025](https://preview.redd.it/uaqjn5ttzjme1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1655158da3e72b9b29e917f7e208c8f4fe8190a)

**2. Ally Sentnor** (Centaur), FW

Ally was the shining start for the first half of the Royals season in her first year of professional soccer. Earning the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year Award, captaining the USWNT at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2024 to 3rd place along with a Bronze Ball win, and scoring 2 goals in 3 games during her first SheBelieves Cup made Sentnor well-known across the League. Sentnor is definitely one to watch, and she will be a critical piece of the Royals' 2025 season. Fun fact: the announcer at America First Field accidentally announced ""Ally Cenatur"" throughout the game.

[Photo: Originally posted on X](https://preview.redd.it/0wntnozd0kme1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5097c9f7a72bf1ed5b42712d341f1aa8d325259)

**3. Kate Del Fava (KDF)**, DF - With so many injuries to the team’s back line, KDF became the MVP of the season staying steady (playing every minute of the regular season!) and taking on a real leadership role for the team.

**In-season players out:**

* **Addisyn Merrick**, DF, to Carolina Ascent
* **Ify Onumonu**, FW, to Montpellier
* **Amandine Henry**, MF, to Deportivo Toluca
* **Frankie Tagliaferri**, MF, no new club announced

While nobody had super high hopes for a young and mostly unknown team and an untested coach, I don’t think anyone predicted such a poor first half of the season. Following the Summer Cup, however, Utah showed some serious promise, but ultimately ended at #11 and was unable to turn things around enough to qualify for the playoffs.

**\_\_\_**

# Offseason

**Players Out**

**Carly Nelson**, 27, GK

**Realistic Best Case Scenario (5th)**

While the Royals were much more successful in the 2nd half of their inaugural season, some of their top players (Cloe Lacasse, Imani Dorsey, Paige Monaghan, Alex Loera, and Lauren Flynn) suffered injuries last season, and it is unclear where they are at in their recovery. With that in mind and a still very young roster, Utah will likely be fighting an uphill battle to make it into the playoffs. Realistically, this is possible, especially if the defense can continue holding strong while Zornoza partners with Tanaka, Sentnor, and Solorzano up top to strengthen the attack along the length of the field. While this team is probably not ready for the shield, its definitely possible for them to finish in the top 3rd of the rankings and make it into the playoffs. 

**Realistic Worst Case Scenario (14th)**

With existing injuries and some untested players new to the NWSL, the Royals could fail to connect and have significant gaps. Unfortunately, landing somewhere at the bottom of the table could be a very real possibility for this team. 

**Realistic Most Probable Scenario (9th)**

Sooo close! This is a very different team from last year, but without any clear stand-out star signings, Utah will likely see another ""growth"" year. Hopefully, even if the team continues to experience growing pains, this year will at least be an opportunity to identify a core strategy and build talent around that. Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets has[ experience working with young teams](https://sonofgao.substack.com/p/utah-royals-hand-the-keys-over-to), and his influence and structure really enhanced the team's cohesion last year.

**2024 Season Review** 

The 2024 NWSL season saw the return of the Utah Royals, originally founded in 2017 and ultimately relocated to Kansas City in 2020 following owner controversy. In their first season back, Utah’s front office tried to create a home town feel by hiring former Royals player Amy Rodriguez (ARod) as Head Coach and building a roster filled with local college talent.

About 4 games into the season, Utah continued to build its roster with 3 new signings: Macey Fraser (NZ, former club Wellington Phoenix FC), Amandine Henry (FR, former club Angel City FC), and Ana Tejada (ESP, former club Real Sociedad). Fraser only made 4 appearances for the club with a consistent ankle injury and an extended excused absence for most of the season. While Henry brought noticeable experience and confidence to the pitch, she was unable to secure a consistent starting role for the team. Last but not least, Tejada worked her way into the starting 11 quickly, and ultimately proved to be a central piece of the defensive mid.

After 11 matches leaving the Royals with 1 win, 9 losses, and 1 tie, ARod was fired and newly appointed Assistant Head Coach Jimmy Coenraets was promoted to interim head coach. The team’s Goalkeeping coach was also fired and the team President was reassigned to a different project.

While many fans felt outraged at the sudden sacking of ARod, especially because it came right after a much improved look with the Royals tying the Portland Thorns, many have come to accept that this was the right move. Inside sources also indicate that Coenraets actually acted as head coach at that Portland game (his lineup, his strategy). Shortly after the big staffing changes, the league entered international break, and Utah made some major roster changes that enabled them to show strong in the Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup in which Utah settled at the top of their group and was one slot away from the finals. Here is a summary of the roster changes made during international break:

* Mina Tanaka (JPN, former club INAC Kobe Leonessa)
   * Position: FW
   * Influence: As a seasoned international player, Tanaka was consistently able to help Utah transition into more favorable offensive positions. She started in all 7 appearances for the Royals in the 2024 season.
* Claudia Zornoza (ESP, former club Real Madrid)
   * Position: MF
   * Influence: Another seasoned international, Zornoza had a hugely positive impact on the team. Her coordination between the back line and the forwards created more scoring opportunities resulting in 3 assists and 2 goals over 10 games. Zornoza also started for all 10 of her appearances.
* Cloé Lacasse (CAN, former club Arsenal)
   * Position: FW
   * Influence: Have you spotted a theme yet? Another seasoned international player for the Royals coming in making big moves, including the Club’s first hat trick and the first hat trick of the 2024 NWSL season. With 4 goals in 9 games, Lacasse became the Royals’ top scorer for the season. In her 9th appearance for the Royals, Lacasse suffered a devastating ACL rupture and MCL sprain, moving her to the season-ending injury list. Lacasse will continue her recovery and is expected to miss a significant portion of the 2025 season.

Other Major Injuries

* Imani Dorsey, DF, ruptured achilles in the 2nd game of the season
* Lauren Flynn, DF, bilateral compartment syndrome in lower legs

Standout Players

* Mandy McGlynn, G - incredible season earning her multiple call up’s to the USWNT
* Ally Sentnor, FW - was the shining start for the first half of the Royals season in her first year of professional soccer - also earned multiple call up’s to the USWNT and definitely one to watch
* Kate Del Fava (KDF), DF - with so many injuries to the team’s back line, KDF became the MVP of the season staying steady and taking on a real leadership role for the team.

In-season players out:

* Addisyn Merrick, DF, Carolina Ascent
* Ify Onumonu, FW, Montpellier
* Amandine Henry, MF, Deportivo Toluca
* Frankie Tagliaferri, MF

While nobody had super high hopes for a young and mostly unknown team and an untested coach, I don’t think anyone predicted such a poor first half of the season. Following the Summer Cup, however, Utah showed some serious promise, but ultimately ended at #11 and was unable to turn things around enough to qualify for the playoffs.

Including $50 million given directly to the Foundation in 2016, one of the years in which Trudeau visited the island \[[2](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/the-aga-khan-trip-and-a-glimpse-into-trudeaus-bad-judgement/)\]. It is peculiar that the Canadian government would use taxpayer money to finance initiatives of one of the wealthiest individuals on the planet, with recent estimates of his net worth at over $13 billion \[[3](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/02/aga-khan-spiritual-leader-multi-billionaire)\].

Even more curious is the nature of who the Aga Khan is. The Aga Khan claims to be a direct descendant of the prophet Mohammed, and is the religious leader of millions of Ismaili Muslims. Ismailism has a history of being an occult religion practiced in secrecy, and preaches an esoteric interpretation of the Quran based on Hermetic teachings \[[4](https://prod-static-iis.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/Anthology%202%20Intro-295536421.pdf)\]. Hermeticism is an ancient philosophy which claims to hold the teachings of the Greek god Hermes amongst others. Hermes is known as a shepherd of men, the deity of gain (either honest or dishonest) \[[5](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hermes-Greek-mythology)\], and the patron of thieves, tricksters and liars \[[6](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hermes#cite_note-2)\]. As the only Olympian capable of crossing the boundary between the living and the dead, Hermes is said to serve as the conductor of souls to Hades \[[7](https://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Hermes/hermes.html)\]. Hermeticism asserts that there is a single, true theology which was given by God to some of the first humans, and that traces of which may still be found in various ancient systems of thought.

It is not a coincidence that the Hermetic symbol, the Caduceus, can be found in the lap of the Baphomet, the central deity of Satanists (and the Knights Templar). Since Satan is described as a shapeshifter that takes on many forms and guises, this allows Satanists to look at various pagan practices throughout history and state that these various pagan gods were simply various forms that Satan has taken throughout history. Satanism is truthfully just another form of Hermeticism, as both are attempts at unifying numerous pagan beliefs under a single world religion, the perfect companion for a world government. It is for this very reason that Aga Khan lll was made President of the League of Nations in 1937, the first attempt at a single governmental body for the entire planet. It is also not a coincidence that Freemasons openly state: ""Freemasonry is the purest inheritor of the Metaphysics and Symbology of the Hermetic Tradition” \[[8](https://www.newjerseygrandlodge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FREEMASONRY-AND-THE-HERMETIC-DOCTRINE.pdf)\].

The wealthiest family in Canada, the Thomson family is a key component of the Canadian cabal as they own Thomson Reuters (largest news service in the world), and the Globe &amp; Mail (largest newspaper in Canada), amongst a large portfolio of other companies. Their propaganda is incredibly powerful, as it is through propaganda that the narrative is constructed and consent is manufactured.

Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and Minister of Finance, worked at both Reuters and the Globe &amp; Mail, and she represents the extremely wealthy Toronto riding of Rosedale where the Thomson family lives. She also has a family history in the industry as her grandfather was a high ranking Nazi propagandist \[[9](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/chrystia-freelands-granddad-was-indeed-a-nazi-collaborator-so-much-for-russian-disinformation)\]. Additionally, she sits on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum along with Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England \[[10](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rupa-subramanya-chrystia-freelands-side-gig-with-the-wef-is-endangering-canadian-democracy)\]. Note that Klaus Schwab, founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF, also has a family history of collaborating with the Nazis.

It is unfortunately poorly understood that Nazi ideology was based on the teachings of Madame Blavatsky and her Satanic Theosophical cult \[[11](https://youtu.be/fGUq3V8kl30)\]. As a gross oversimplification, Nazi ideology was a rejection of Christianity in favour of reinterpreted pagan beliefs. Widespread human sacrifice as well as the use of the Swastika across the globe was supposedly proof that large swaths of the world had once been ruled by the Aryan race \[[12](https://youtu.be/tuB2L6SN6Lg)\]. One should note that the definition of “Holocaust” is “a sacrifice consumed by fire” \[[13](https://youtu.be/7BsgACPTOYE)\]. Just like Satanism and Hermeticism, Nazi ideology is a melting pot of pagan beliefs \[[14](https://youtu.be/Yq3O8LaIcfw)\].

In the infamous video where Klaus Schwab brags “we penetrate the cabinets” of governments around the world \[[15](https://youtu.be/wUCeYJagkeI)\], David Gergen, former Counselor to President Bill Clinton, can be seen seated across from Klaus on stage. Alex Jones interviewed Gergen about his involvement in Bohemian Grove where Gergen admitted to attending, and chastised Jones for violating the understanding of secrecy related to the event \[[16](https://youtu.be/u2wHnuhkUeM)\]. Alex Jones notoriously infiltrated Bohemian Grove and captured video footage of the event, bringing international attention to the debaucherous gathering of global elites in the forests north of San Francisco where a “mock” human sacrifice is performed in front of a giant owl deity representing the pagan deity Moloch.

Andrew Coyne, another star propagandist at the Thomson owned Globe &amp; Mail, had a father, James Elliott Coyne, who was a Liberal appointed Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Prime Minister of the time, John Diefenbaker, famously fired Coyne in what would go on to be called the Coyne Affair, calling Coyne ""a communist in sheep's clothing"". Andrews Coyne's cousin, Deborah Coyne, also had a child in secret with Pierre Elliot Trudeau \[[17](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/kelly-mcparland-deborah-coynes-trudeau-memoir-is-too-much-information)\].

Both Chrystia Freeland and James Elliott Coyne were Rhodes scholars. The Rhodes scholarship is awarded to individuals from wealthy families to study at Oxford University, and was set up by Cecil Rhodes who monopolized South African and Rhodesian (now called Zimbabwe) diamond mines with Rothschild financing. Rhodes was exposed working with Nathaniel Rothschild and others to set up a secret society with the stated purpose of ruling the world in secret \[[18](https://www.wondriumdaily.com/cecil-rhodes-and-the-society-of-the-elect/)\]. Other Rhodes scholars include: Bill Clinton, former prime minister John Turner, John Evans (chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation), Dominic Barton (former Canadian Ambassador to China and current Chair of Rio Tinto, a company formerly owned by the Rothschilds), James Gibson (private secretary to William Lyon Mackenzie King), George Ignatieff (father of Michael Ignatief), David Lewis (key architect and leader of NDP), Bob Rae and countless other elitists in politics, universities and elsewhere.

Marc Kielburger of WE Charity scandal fame was also a Rhodes scholar. In 2020, Trudeau awarded a sole-source $900 million contract to Marc Kielburgers WE Charity which had paid Justin Trudeau’s family over $512,000 to speak at their events \[[19](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/corbella-document-dump-proves-pmo-involved-in-we-charity-plan)\], and had initially lied by stating that they had never done so \[[20](https://youtu.be/FC_wos7MwHo)\]. WE was also found to have lied about the construction of hundreds of projects, the funding for which was never accounted for \[[21](https://youtu.be/wjRjIEXh-mY)\]. Bill Morneau, the Minister of Finance at the time, had personally enjoyed an all expenses paid vacation to Ecuador paid for by WE in addition to having a daughter who worked for the charity. Just hours before 5,000 pages of heavily redacted documents on the scandal were released, Justin prorogued Parliament for over a month in order to avoid questioning. Truthfully, WE has always been a Liberal propaganda department masquerading as a charity, filling stadiums with young Canadians and encouraging them to vote Liberal in order to “save the world”.

One example of a conflict of interest in the Thomson propaganda machine can be found in the fact that the ex-CEO of Thomson Reuters, Jim Smith, now sits on the board of Pfizer and is involved with multiple initiatives with the World Economic Forum.

A prime example of the Thomson family attempting to control the narrative can be found in Thomson Reuters firing their Director of Data Science for the thought crime of demonstrating that the data does not demonstrate disproportionate targeting of blacks by police \[[22](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10810363/White-Reuters-data-scientist-said-FIRED-woke-BLM-bullies-newswire.html)\]. They can't have this truth come out because it would destroy the narrative they have created to keep us divided.

You can read up on the Thomson family in a Maclean's article available online which talks about how the Thomson family likes to spend Christmas with the Rothschilds, how Mayor of Toronto, John Tory, is the son of Ken Thomson's right hand man, and how David Thomson admits to being ""a secret member of a secret order” \[[23](https://archive.macleans.ca/article/2006/5/8/canadas-richest-family-the-thomsons-are-worth-238-billion)\].

It should be noted that beyond John Tory's close relationship with the Thomson Family, John Tory was a friend to the late Ted Rogers and served as President and CEO of Rogers Media (parent company of Citytv), and later as President and CEO of Rogers Cable (Canada's largest cable television service provider and the largest shareholder of CPAC) \[[24](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-tory-made-almost-700k-from-rogers-while-mayor-talk-about-an-optics-problem)\]. To this day, Tory continues to be paid $100,000 per year for serving on the ""advisory committee"" to the Rogers Control Trust which owns 97.5% of Rogers. These relationships further solidify the cabal's iron grip on the mass media in Canada.

In another Maclean's article available online you can read up on the Rothschild family and their long history of influence in Canada \[[25](https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1956/7/7/the-rothschilds-fabulous-stake-in-canada)\]. This includes purchasing Canadian land larger than the combined size of England and Wales. The article also talks about how the Rothschilds have a strict policy of intermarriage (incest) so as that they ""don't have to share secrets that way"".

The Thomson's curiously spent $115 million in 2002 to purchase ""The Massacre of the Innocents"" a painting depicting the biblical scene in which King Herod orders the execution of all male children two years old and under in an attempt to murder Jesus \[[26](https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2018/08/10/too-naked-too-violent-the-art-gallery-of-ontarios-troubling-100m-masterpiece-hits-the-road.html)\]. The painting features a man murdering a baby by smashing it's head against a concrete column with his bare hands while standing on a pile of dead babies.

The Rothschilds are known to have a similar taste in ""art"" and are fans of Marina Abramovic's Satanic ""art work"". Marina Abramovic was infamously brought to the spotlight when WikiLeaks emails revealed that John Podesta, Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, Obama's Counselor to the President and Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, was invited to a Satanic Spirit Cooking ritual \[[27](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893)\]. Marina had previously held an ""art exhibit"" where she wrote the recipe for a Spirit Cooking with pigs blood on the wall \[[28](https://youtu.be/3EsJLNGVJ7E)\]. Ingredients included: urine, sperm, blood and breast milk. You can find a photograph online of Marina Abramovic and Jacob Rothschild posing in front of a painting labeled ""Satan Summoning His Legions"".

In another leaked email a Senior Foreign Service Officer emailed Hillary Clinton about “sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch” \[[29](https://web.archive.org/web/20220211055749/https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333)\].

The Liberal Party of Canada has been controlled by sinister forces for a long time. William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberal Prime Minister of Canada for over 21 years between 1921-1948 and the longest serving Prime Minister in Canadian history, also happened to have worked for the Rockefeller Foundation. John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s official biographer would even go on to describe William Lyon Mackenzie King as having been John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s closest friend \[[30](https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cbmh.10.1.67)\]. The result of this friendship would be Rockefeller financing of Canadian Universities for ""medical research"" and the resulting corruption of the Canadian medical establishment.

In 1975 Nelson Rockefeller, Vice President of the United States, led the Rockefeller Commission, which purported to investigate illegal CIA activities including MKUltra, where the CIA conducted mind control experiments on Canadian soil at McGill University. McGill just so happens to have been one of the primary beneficiaries of Rockefeller financing through the Rockefeller Foundation including over $1.2 million in 1932 ($37 million in 2022 dollars) to establish the Montreal Neurological Institute \[[31](http://neurostudyclub.mcgill.ca/jan2001/olser/jan2000_olsp1.htm)\]. Unsurprisingly, the Rockefeller Commission failed to bring any justice to those responsible for the atrocities committed.

Nelson Rockefeller also had an ""art collection"" cataloged in a book titled ""Masterpieces of Primitive Art"". Besides being the owner of the collection, Nelson was also co-author and described many of the pieces as originating from ""secret controlling societies"", additionally there are multiple passages of text in the book which talk about Satanism. 

Percy Rockefeller, Prescott Bush, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, John Kerry, and many other extremely influential people throughout history belong to the Skull and Bones society at Yale where members are sworn to secrecy and said to perform Satanic rituals. Members are known to take on codenames including: Long Devil, Baal, and Magog \[[32](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/george-w-knight-of-eulogia/304686/)\]; all of which are words used to refer to either Satan or his allies. It is important to understand that the Bush family made their original fortune by illegally operating in secret as financial agents of NAZI collaborators \[[33](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar)\]. It is also important to understand that George H.W. Bush was director of the CIA before he became President, and many evil acts were committed under his leadership \[[34](https://theintercept.com/2018/12/01/the-ignored-legacy-of-george-h-w-bush-war-crimes-racism-and-obstruction-of-justice/)\].

In George H.W. Bush’s 1988 Republican National Convention speech he grins and states that he will ""go from the hills to the hollows"", and has a psychotic look in his eyes when stating “a thousand points of light” \[[35](https://youtu.be/CdX_lGn6GRY)\]. Bush Sr. talked again about “1000 points of light” in his 1989 inaugural speech where he stated that ""the old ideas are new again"", “sacrifice” being one of them \[[36](https://youtu.be/SQhbEh8AeSA)\]. In 2014, Bill Clinton stated that there are “a few little rituals that have to be observed” in order to “give the American people the feeling that democracy is peaceful and honorable” and “that the only thing George Herbert Walker Bush asked me to do, is to preserve the points of light"" \[[37](https://youtu.be/_d4sDwFgNYQ)\]. In 2018, Bush Jr. stated that his father “was the brightest of a thousand points of light” at his father's funeral \[[38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZdp1TqHOYE&amp;ab_channel=ABC13Houston)\]. In 2001, Bush Jr. proclaimed at his inauguration “Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?” \[[39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVgMl-2fqAo&amp;list=PLqmeDPExM7EuAZ0a-d6GndoIn1NLRsvJn&amp;index=14&amp;ab_channel=TimHayes)\].

Note that Lucifer is said to be a fallen angel and the bearer of light. The Great Invocation widely used in Luciferian Theosophical circles starts with the phrase: ""From the Point of Light within the Mind of God, Let light stream forth into the minds of men"" \[[40](https://theosophy.wiki/en/Alice_Bailey)\]. This “prayer” was written in 1937 by Alice Bailey who was central in popularizing Madame Blavatsky’s Satanic Theosophical teachings in America. In the early 1920’s Bailey, along with her 33⁰ Freemason husband \[[41](https://theosophy.wiki/en/Foster_Bailey)\], created the Lucifer Publishing Company \[[42](https://www.lucistrust.org/about_us/history)\]. The organization has consultative status with the United Nations and has offices close to the UN in both New York and Geneva \[[43](https://www.lucistrust.org/about_us/support_un)\].

With decentralized media accessed through the internet threatening the cabal's monopoly on information, governments around the world are relying upon ever increasing use of censorship in order to maintain narrative control. Without free speech we have no hope of informing the wider public of these facts, and waking people up to the desire of those in power to bring about a one world government unified under Satanism.

In 2015, the 2,000 year old Arch of Baal was destroyed by ISIS. Baal is said to have been offered infant sacrifices, and is generally regarded as synonymous with Satan \[[44](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/baal)\] The arch was reconstructed by Oxford University and transported to Trafalgar Square in London, City Hall park in New York City, the World Government Summit in Dubai, the G7 conference in Florence, and the National Mall in Washington D.C. \[[45](http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/washington-dc)\].

In its simplest form Satanism is a complete inversion of Judeo-Christian values where the 7 deadly sins are considered virtues \[[46](https://pdfhost.io/v/pFjpvaqhv_140554NCJRS)\]. By promoting Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, and Pride- Satanists claim that their evil deeds are justified. 

In the Bible it talks about a time in which the world is governed by the Satan during which: “it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666”. In Sweden, they have started to implant microchips into individuals' hands to allow them to make purchases \[[47](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61008730)\]. In 2022, Amazon released a palm reading payment system for their whole foods locations \[[48](https://gizmodo.com/whole-foods-palm-contactless-payment-amazon-1849395184)\]. Coincidentally, Microsoft filed patent 060606 in 2020 for a system where a sensor is in the device of the user which will then verify if body activity data satisfies conditions in order to award cryptocurrency \[[49](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020060606)\]. Bill 6666 was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 2020 which sought to award $100 billion to faith-based organizations and others in order to keep track of everywhere you go and everyone you interact with under the guise of COVID-19 measures \[[50](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr6666/summary)\]. Additionally, bill 666 was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 2021 which sought to direct the CDC to declare racism a public health crisis and “collect and analyze data” on the subject. Bill 666 also sought to direct the CDC in coordination with the DOJ and others, to carry out “law enforcement violence prevention” \[[51](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/666)\].

Understand that woke culture is rooted in Satanism. Satanism is a philosophy which amongst other things flips traditional values on its head and claims that the 7 deadly sins are actually virtues.

Lust: A promiscuous hook up culture is encouraged and facilitated by free, easy and unrestricted access to contraceptives and abortions. Companies such as Tinder, Grindr and Ashley Madison further promote this immoral behavior. Any criticism of these facts is shut down with terms such as “slut shaming”, “misogyny” and “patriarchy"". Children are progressively being hyper sexualized with woke sex-ed curriculums, drag shows for children, porn and reframing of pedophiles as “minor attracted persons”.

Gluttony: Attempts are being made to reframe unhealthy body weights as acceptable with terms such as “body positivity”. Celebrities such as Lizzo are celebrated for being obese, while those such as Adele are shamed for losing weight. Insanity. Any attempted criticism of these facts is labelled “body shaming”. Gluttony does not only refer to food and drink but rather the overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. As such, a variety of over consumption habits within our materialistic society can be defined as gluttonous.

Greed: A materialistic culture hyper focused on the accumulation of goods and wealth, without a genuine concern for the economic wellbeing of the general population. Tax loopholes and tax havens are specifically designed for the benefit of the greediest in our society. Financialization of housing has our society in a conflict of interest with the economic well being of future generations.

Sloth: The proliferation of sedentary careers and lifestyles promote a sloth like existence. With work from home, online shopping and food delivery, one could conceivably never leave their house. Cheap and plentiful television, movies, video games and sports viewing (instead of playing) entice many to never leave their couch. Social assistance programs conditional upon low incomes disincentivizes hard work.

Wrath: An unforgiving, overly judgmental, and often immoral cancel culture treats anyone with opposing viewpoints as deserving of the mobs wrath. Peaceful protesting is replaced with violent rioting. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance, this can help to explain the woke mobs obsession with the past wrongs of colonization and slavery and their desire for affirmative action, reparations, and other racist policies which seek to punish those with no individual guilt. Soft on crime policies are encouraged as those acting violently (Wrath) or stealing (Greed) are actually acting virtuously in the eyes of a Satanist. Foreign policy is defined by war mongering in the Middle East, in Ukraine and elsewhere.

Envy: Social media has been designed to produce feelings of jealousy, with publicly visible like counts, friend numbers and other design choices made with this express intent. Individuals often display a sugar coated version of their lives on social media, deceiving others as to their struggles, and further promoting the envy of others. Celebrity culture, and luxury brands stimulate these feelings and are propagated throughout our society with tabloids and incessant media coverage.

Pride: The original and worst of the 7 deadly sins, Pride is also the sin most publicly championed and celebrated by modern society. Individuals are encouraged to be prideful in their sexual orientation, ethnicity and gender (as long as they are not a straight white male). However, these attitudes are narcissistic in nature, leading to superiority complexes, inflated egos and a general lack of self awareness. The resulting lack of humility inhibits self improvement, and helps to produce shallow, self-righteous individuals.

As much as the church has gotten a number of things wrong in the past, whether it was pedophile clergymen, homophobia, residential schools, church sponsorship of religious war, or whatever other gripe you might personally have with the church. It is undeniable that the church got far more right than it ever got wrong. It is also important to recognize that one does not have to be religious in order to recognize the truth of the 7 deadly sins being immoral. Additionally, one does not have to be religious in order to recognize that their are those that worship the Devil.

These are no longer theories, these are facts. You have the knowledge now to help spread the truth before it's too late. To inform the public of these facts will require a group effort. Please help to do your part!!",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.247058,2022-10-18T16:28:09,Rio Tinto,2022

Utah is back in the NWSL and we’re very excited to be here! A lot of the details and predictions for this team are still TBD considering we’re working with a brand new coach, management, and roster. But there was a dedicated fan base around this club the first time around, who will no doubt be ready to support this team from the start.

**\_\_\_**

**BACKGROUND**

**Head Coach**: [Amy Rodriguez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Rodriguez)

A.Rod: you know her, you love her. She’s a legend for USWNT, as well as having a great professional career in the US, including playing for the original iteration of this club. She began her managerial career in 2022 as an assistant coach at her alma mater, USC. This is her first time taking on the role as a head coach of any team, as well as her first time managing a professional side.

**Sporting Director**: [Kelly Cousins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Cousins)

Cousins started her managerial career at her youth club, Reading FC. During her stint as director/manager of the club, Reading went from the 3rd tier of English football to a 4th place finish in the WSL.

**Captain**: TBD

**Stadium**: America First Stadium

Formerly Rio Tinto Stadium, or Rio T, which several fans have said they would still prefer to nickname it (a lot catchier and less cringey than America First). Located in Sandy, about a 20 minute drive from Salt Lake City. It is also within a 5-10 minute walk from the light rail station (TRAX) which is a great option for home and away fans on game day, as parking is limited.

**Ownership**: David Blitzer &amp; Ryan Smith, who also co-own Real Salt Lake

**Mascot**: Cleo the Lioness

**Kits**

Our primary kit is called [‘The Ascent’](https://www.rsl.com/utahroyals/news/photo-gallery-the-ascent) and features layers of mountains in yellow.

The secondary kit is called [‘Mountain Heir’](https://www.rsl.com/utahroyals/news/photo-gallery-mountain-heir) and looks similar to everyone else’s secondary kit.

**Supporters Groups**: During the 3 seasons of the previous URFC there were 2 supporters groups

The Court ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/161737274489634/)) located behind the north side goal

The South Side Exiles (no site link) on the south of the pitch

**Subreddit**: [r/UtahRoyalsFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/UtahRoyalsFC/)

**News and Commentary**: I was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of the local news outlets with pieces written about the Return of Royalty and the roster build. There were also a few fan blogs/podcasts/twitter accounts that seemed to have good commentary and were worth mentioning.

**HISTORY**

While Royals previously only spent 3 years in the NWSL (2018-2020), it does feel like there’s some good chemistry between the club and the local fan base. There is a decent soccer community in the SLC area, and I found many

**\_\_\_**

**NEW ROSTER BUILD**

An expansion club means building a team completely from scratch. There’s a good mix of NWSL veterans, a few international signees, and some exciting new prospects from the college draft. Many of the players selected have some sort of connection to Utah, whether it be their home state, or because they went to BYU for college. Local soccer fans will recognize a lot of these names and be excited for their homecoming.

Since they’re all new additions, here are some of the highlights:

***College Draftees:***

**Ally Sentnor**  MF/FW  #9

2024 1st overall draft pick from UNC. She’s made a name for herself as an attacker on the U-20 national team as well as for the Tarheels.

**Brecken Mozingo**  FW  #15

2024 1st round draft pick from BYU and Sandy, UT native. She can play on the wing, and her passing and handling will be important for attack building..

***NWSL Veterans:***

**Mandy Haught**  GK  #1

Traded from Gotham, and also played her 2022 season in Sweden. She was a huge part of Gotham’s title winning season.

**Imani Dorsey**  FW/DF  #28

Free agent from Gotham. She took 2023 off to focus on mental health. Kelly Cousins noted that she feels Dorsey will be a source of leadership in this squad.

**Mikayla Cluff**  MF  #21

Traded from Orlando. She’s a Utah native, as well as a BYU alum, where she played mostly offensively. With Pride, she transitioned into more of a defensive role initially, and became a very versatile midfielder thanks to those skill sets.

**Maddie Pogarch**  DF  #16

Free agent from San Diego. Po played full back at Wave, known for pressing and winning the ball higher up the pitch, as well as a high goal involvement percentage for a defender.

**Michele Vasconcelos**  FW  #7

Free agent signing from Thorns. She’s another UT native and BYU alum who has several seasons of NWSL experience under her belt, as well as a season at Sevilla in Spain.

**Kaleigh Riehl**  DF  #18

Traded from San Diego. She made up half of the rock-solid center back duo (with Girma) and will bring good experience to our back line.

**Ify Onumonu**  FW  #11

She has several seasons of NWSL play under her belt as well as playing in the most recent World Cup for Nigeria. She should bring plenty of experience to the squad.

\_\_\_

**2024 PREVIEW**

**Realistic Best Case Scenario:**

Obviously, a best case scenario is a successful season, which might just mean finishing in the middle of the table, as this is year #1. But otherwise, I’d hope to see this new team learn how to play cohesively together, and that Amy Rodriguez is able to flesh out her coaching style effectively on the field.

**Realistic Worst Case Scenario:**

I adore Rodriguez, but she has never coached a team at this level before, and it’s hard to predict how successful she can be on this stage and in this role. Likewise, there are quite a few players who didn’t get a ton of playing time at their previous clubs, so it’s hard to say how well they will perform. It’s a first season together and could be a huge flop.

**Realistic Most Probable Scenario**

Possibly an underwhelming season, maybe just flying under the radar and finishing toward the bottom or middle of the table. Hopefully the team will get used to playing together and develop a core of starters and a rhythm together to carry into future seasons.

675,3lng1p,Our Seats Matter,RealSaltLakeRioT,/r/MLS/comments/3lng1p/our_seats_matter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/3lng1p/our_seats_matter/,82,84,1442730745.0,"With less than a month before season ticket renewal, Real Salt Lake's front office dropped the bombshell that over 300 season ticket holders will have to pay 4x the price of their seats next year, or move.  The decision was made that the rows W, X, Y, Z and the ADA row's in sections 1, 2, and 37 will be made into ""premium seating"" next year with a price tag of $2200-$2500 a seat.  There are perks to joining the premium seating, like free food, free parking etc., but many of the season ticket holders who sit in these sections don't have the money to pay for their seats next year.  So now, they are going to have to find other seats, in a stadium that has 15,000+ STH's in a 20k seat stadium.

The follow letter was sent to only the displaced season ticket holders:

""For 2016, Rio Tinto Stadium is introducing a new premium area, the first of its kind on the venue's East Side. Above sections 37, 1 and 2, the ""Midfield Club"" joins a host of Rio Tinto Stadium's numerous premium seating options. There will be a restaurant and bar built in this club and you will have access to this. As a member of the club you will receive unlimited food and drinks, but alcohol is an added charge. You will also receive a south lot parking pass to allow you easy access from your car to the club. You will also receive other premium perks that go along with being a club seat holder.
 
Rows W, X, Y, and Z are included in this club. The new price for these tickets is $2,200. The ADA row in section 1 is also included in the club and the price for those seats is $2,500. If you would like to be a part of this new club your have the first rights to your seats. If you do not want to be a part of the new East Side Club but would still like to have seats for 2016, I will be working to relocate your tickets. I will be reaching out to everyone to discuss the different options with you. You will be hearing from me soon if you have not already. I hope to reach everyone before the end of the week but if you have any questions or concerns feel free to give me a call.""

US Soccer is the fastest growing spectator sport, and as a business decision, it makes sense to offer more premium seating, but in this case, what will the cost be?

I am one of the displaced season ticket holders.  My wife and I have been in these seats for 3 years.  What RSL's front office doesn't seem to understand is that for many of us, we've sat next to the same fans for the last few years.  We're family now.  Our son, who is a little over a year old comes to the games with us.  He plays with the little boy in the row ahead of us, and flirts with the little girl two rows ahead.  The man I now call one of my best friends and his wife sit right in front of us.  We would have never met them had it not been for our seats.

What hurts the most is the seeming lack of care that RSL's front office has for us.  They count the money rather than the fans.  Sure, I'd love premium seats someday, but right now, we're a young married couple, like many of those around us, who love the sport, but haven't been in our careers long enough to warrant paying the price for ""premium"" seats.  Between the time we heard of this new arrangement and the end of the season there are only 2 more home games (one of which was tonight against the LA Galaxy), and a month before we need to renew our seats for the 2016 season.  It's unlikely that in less than months time I'm going to be able to save up an extra $3k to get me seats for next year.

Oh, and in case you didn't know, RSL offered (for a small price) a way to lock in our seats for the next 3 years at the 2015 Season Ticket price.  Whoops!  Looks like I got scammed.  There has been no mention of getting that money back.

When asked about this change and what's going to happen, we've all received the same answer: ""Don't worry, if you don't renew your seats at the premium price for next year, you'll be 1st on the list to get new seats!""  I sit in section 1 in seats 15-16, right at midfield.  Between my seat and the seat next to me is the midfield line.  I love these seats.  Next year, I don't know where I'm going to be able to sit.  I can't afford the premium seats, and there is a waiting list to get into section 1.  There is no way our group is going to be able to stay together with those odds.

If anyone is interested the hashtag #ourseatsmatter is being used on social media.  We're trying to reach out to anyone who will listen.  We would like to sit down with RSL's owner and have him look all 300 of us in the eye and tell us that our seats don't matter to him.

Link to the letter and some signs we held up tonight at the game:  http://imgur.com/gallery/m4dTL/new

TL:DR Season tickets went from $600 a seat to $2200 a seat, but only for 300 RSL fans.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:17.247143,2015-09-20T16:32:25,Rio Tinto,2015

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

He has extensive open-pit development experience from his time working with Rio Tinto at the Iron Ore Company of Canada and at Kaunis Iron in Northern Sweden where he was Project Director.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.  
Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)  
1.⁠ ⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow: Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.  
2.⁠ ⁠All-Star Team: The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.  
3.⁠ ⁠Wise Asset Management: The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. Element79 Gold has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.  
Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown  
Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?  
Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.  
(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.  
Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.  
And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.  
In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.  
The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.  
Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.  
Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.  
Path to Cashflow  
The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:  
1.⁠ ⁠Exploration Program: An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.  
2.⁠ ⁠Leverage Regional Infrastructure: The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.  
3.⁠ ⁠Secure a Buyer: Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and  
generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.  
Production Potential  
Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,  
emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success  
Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.  
And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.  
These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.  
Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada

Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.  
For example:

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.  
Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.  
After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the  
fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.  
Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.  
Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""  
Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.  
So what does that mean for investors?  
It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!  
While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.  
(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.  
There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.  
Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK  
Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly.

These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

These properties have near-term potential for obtaining resource reports and are primed for spin-outs, Joint Ventures (JVs), and outright sales.

**High-Grade Projects in British Columbia and Ontario**

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

• **Option Agreement with Green Power Minerals** (August 2023): Divesting the Maverick Springs Project in Nevada for a value surpassing C$5.5 million, compared to the initial acquisition price of approximately C$3.2 million. The transformation of Maverick Springs into an open pit alone was impactful, turning the previous 1.8MM oz historical resource into a current Inferred Resource of 3.71MM oz AuEq (1.37M oz Au and 175.7M oz Ag).

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

Now let's take a deeper look into why Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is built to win in this upcoming gold rush, with the right property, the right team, and the right business plan to succeed.

**Top 3 Reasons to Give Your Attention to Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)**

1.⁠ **⁠Near-Term Production and Cash Flow:** Through Peruvian ore extraction from a previously producing mine at its Lucero property, and an ore offtake agreement in place with a major, Element79 Gold has strategically positioned itself with a unique opportunity for near-term cash flow, which quickly puts the company into a position to move forward more smoothly. The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

The property is already permitted for 350 tpd production, and has already produced at solid rates in the past and is seeing production today through artisanal local miners who will be enlisted to carry out production capabilities on the property and likely move ore to local mills for production and quick and easy cashflow to support other operations.

2.⁠ ⁠**All-Star Team:** The team assembled behind Element79 Gold is extraordinary, in that it brings to the table multiple mining experts with experience in finding, developing, and operating mines. Their pedigree is Top-Tier, with multiple CVs that include senior level positions with respectable industry players such as Barrick Gold, Skeena Resources Freeport-McMoran, Eldorado Gold, Koch Industries, MMG, McEwen Mining, Rio Tinto, Kaunis Iron, KGHM, NOVAGOLD, and more. These aren't inexperienced hands at the wheel who have to dig out their university textbooks to see what comes next. These are minds that have seen projects all the way through the cycle, and are primed to do it again with Element79 Gold.

3.⁠ **⁠Wise Asset Management:** The company has accrued 17 projects in Nevada and Canada for Spin-Outs, JVs and sale. **Element79 Gold** has made significant progress toward closing the sale of its Maverick Springs, Long Peak, Stargo, Elder Creek, North Mill Creek, and Elephant projects in Nevada.

**Lucero: The Jewel in Element79 Gold's Crown**

Is it safe to mine in Peru? The place where villagers literally reported being under attack by 7ft-tall 'aliens?

Yes... Peru is not only safe, but it's a FANTASTIC place to mine.

(Editor's Note: An investigation ruled out aliens, and it was illegal miners that were terrorizing locals)

While some investors might be concerned about operating in Peru, they'd be unwise to ignore recent developments like the US Inflation Reduction Act that offer opportunities for the gold, zinc, and tin industry in Peru, benefiting from the free trade agreement with the US.

Additionally, with 74 mining projects to become operative in 2023, representing a total investment of $596 million and 30 projects already in operation, Peru continues to be a global leader in mining-which represents 60% of the country's total exports.

And NOT ALL upcoming mine production is coming from majors.

In June 2022, Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) took a significant step by acquiring two Peruvian properties, including the Lucero Mine-one of Peru's highest-grade underground mines in history.

The Lucero Mine is known for its averaged historical grades of 19 g/t Au Eq, from 14 g/t Au and 450 g/t Ag. This legendary property has already produced on average 40,000 ounces per year in its last five years of production before it was suspended in 2005.

Recent assays in 2023 showed results yielding up to 11.7 ounces per ton gold and 247 ounces per ton silver, further indicating then potential for a significant high-grade operation in the future.

Additionally, Element79 extended its commitment to this region by acquiring the Roxana Vein and surrounding 1200ha property, Lucero del Sur 28, through an auction held on May 17, 2023.

**Path to Cashflow**

The company's three-step strategy to cash flow from Lucero is clear:

1.⁠ **⁠Exploration Program:** An efficient exploration will review previous workings and explore identified surface and underground veins. This process aims to bring the previous work on site to modern standards, giving confidence in developing a defined resource and extracting ore for sale within 12-18 months.

2.⁠ ⁠**Leverage Regional Infrastructure:** The company plans to leverage infrastructure for commercial off-take, generating non-dilutive cash flow to fund corporate operations and exploration across the portfolio.

3.⁠ ⁠**Secure a Buyer:** Now that the company has signed an LOl with BVN, the project is much closer to reanimating and

generating revenue from the flagship past-producing Lucero property in 2024.

**Production Potential**

Authorized for 350 tonnes per day production at the site, the company has highlighted the exceptionally high-grade gold and silver mineralization at the Lucero project,

emphasizing the advantage of having a running start, as the project has been in production in the past.

**Element79 Gold's Wise Asset Management: A Strategy for Success**

Element79 Gold Corp. (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is not only building its reputation through the iconic Lucero Mine, but also through its wise asset management across its diverse portfolio. Just like a seasoned real estate agent who acquires, improves, and flips properties, Element79 has mastered the art of acquiring promising mining properties, raising their value, and selling them for a profit.

And now with an LOl for ore sales in place to Buenaventura, Element79 is on a clear path towards revenue generation in the year ahead.

These strategic moves reflect a keen understanding of the market, a focus on shareholder value, and a commitment to sustainable growth. It's also created capital for further exploration and acquisitions, putting the company in a robust position for future growth.

**Strategic Portfolio in Nevada and Canada**

Element79 Gold's portfolio has included 18 significant projects in Nevada and Canada. Among them were 15 properties along the Getchell and Battle Mountain trends in Nevada, some of which have over 100 holes drilled. With substantial historical drilling yielding promising results, the Battle Mountain Portfolio stands as one of the largest mineral land packages in Nevada, surrounded by the state's biggest producing mines.

For example:

• **Elder Creek** \- 155 holes, up to 3.19 g/t Au over 38.96m.

• **Clover** \- 104 holes, up to 25.3 g/t Au over 9.75m.

• **Long Peak** \- up to 8.02 g/t Au and 174 g/t Ag over 9.14m.

In British Columbia, the company has the promising Snowbird High-Grade Gold Project, likened to significant districts in California. Meanwhile, in Ontario, there's an opportunity to acquire a 100% interest in the greentield Dale Property. Each of these assets represents an opportunity to generate capital for future investments.

**Real Estate-Like Flips for Profit**

Element79 Gold's real estate-like flipping strategy is illustrated by recent property sales:

• **Sale of Long Peak and Stargo Projects** (July 2023): Sold to a subsidiary of Centra Mining Ltd. for CAD $1,000,000, marking a milestone in the strategic development of its gold assets.

• **Asset Transfer and Sale of Synergy Metals Corp** (July 2023): A planned spin-out of the Dale property to unlock its value and provide additional capital for growth.

**With Plans for Production in Peru Soon, Smart Choices in Buying and Selling Properties, a History of Making Money from Those Choices, and a Top-Notch Team Leading the Way, Element79 Gold Corp (CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) is Working to Make 2023's Best Gold Success Story.**

As the year kicks off with a financial rollercoaster on the way, the biggest minds in the market are pointing to 2024 to be the year of GOLD.

Looking ahead, it's nearly unanimous that the precious metal is on a path towards record highs not only in 2024, but in 2025 as well.

After already gaining 13% in 2023 and hitting record highs in December, the

fundamentals are firmly in place for gold to keep climbing.

Analysts at JP Morgan singled out holding gold and silver as their only Bullish Call for the year ahead, and foresee gold's ""breakout rally' in mid-2024 towards $2,300. The Commodities expert at TD is projecting gold could hover at $2,100 by Q2 2024.

Now the former CEO of Sprott Inc. is telling investors to expect another new record gold price in 2024, and foresees an ""M&amp;A market"" in the mining sector where ""I think that the majors have never been busier in their corporate development departments.""

Which points towards a major resurgence for junior gold mining stocks along the road ahead. Inflows towards Gold Miner ETFs seem to confirm the trend.

So what does that mean for investors?

It means they need to start panning for winners, that's what!

**While many in the gold mining sector are digging deep, Element79 Gold Corp.**

**(CSE:ELEM) (OTC:ELMGF) made big waves in 2023 by proving that being nimble, strategic, and responsive to market trends can bring big profits. The team's unparalleled expertise in both asset acquisition and near-term production in Peru shows that gold mining isn't just about digging - it's about knowing when to hold, when to invest, and when to sell.**

There are several factors to consider when evaluating juniors, and Element79 Gold checks ALL the boxes.

Foreseeable production with near-term cash flow? CHECK

Wise asset management with room to grow? CHECK

All-Star team with production experience? CHECK

For those who have won big at this game before, this vetting process is not only fun, but actually easy when the right signs present themselves as clearly as they do with Element79 Gold.

You want to see some signs of near-term cash flow. Whether it's through production or a smart asset sale, you want to know that your investment won't be tied up for eternity.

And now Element79 is moving forward to make the near-term cash flow a reality, having signed an LOl for ore sales in 2024 with Compañia de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (""BVN"") from its flagship Lucero Property in Peru.

Led by a management team with a group of gold diggers with a proven track record of success, Element79 has experience in all aspects of the gold game. When things get going, they won't have to rely on a rookie team that's fishing out their university textbooks to see what to do next.

**Synopsis:**

*Graphene Manufacturing Group is a disruptive clean-technologies company that produces extremely high-quality Graphene through its patented Carbon manufacturing technology. The company is currently researching and developing a suite of products in which their Graphene can be applied including Graphene Aluminium-Ion Batteries, HVAC coatings and Lubricants.* 

**Overview**

Graphene Manufacturing Group (GMG) is a pre-revenue Australian technology company currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company went public in 2020 but had been privately producing Graphene for over 6 years prior.

Led by former Shell Executives, GMG focuses on energy savings and energy storage solutions products. The company's core operations revolve around the production of high-quality, low-cost, scalable, tuneable and low/no contaminated graphene. This proprietary process is held as a trade secret with several patents held by GMG. 

Having carried out extensive research and development programs, GMG is about to begin scaling up the manufacturing of its various graphene products, with samples currently being sent out to numerous interested companies. Full-scale commercial production could be in the near term with GMG making their final investment decision towards the back half of 2023 for their 2032 coin cell Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery (G+AI Battery).

The commission of an expanded graphene manufacturing plant is expected during the first half of 2023 which will significantly boost their graphene production in a fully automated facility. The premises will also house GMG’s blending division where the company will be able to manufacture its Thermal-XR coating and begin distributing the product to the market.

# What is Graphene?

Before diving into the specifics of GMG, it is important to understand what Graphene is.

Graphene is an extremely thin layer of Graphite, at only 1 atom thick with the atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. This structure allows each carbon atom to be bonded to 3 more atoms around it, making Graphene the strongest known material at 100x the strength of steel while being 3x lighter.

https://preview.redd.it/etyn80qmxc7a1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db7efdbaf1f0202baaf7e2c6157190c2a4d0abe8

Graphene atoms also delocalised electrons, meaning the atoms can move around more freely making Graphene extremely adept at conducting electricity and heat. The substance is the most conductive material that humans have ever encountered and is labelled as a super-material. Graphene has a high melting point of 950oC+, is extremely lightweight with a weight aspect ratio of 300m2/gm of surface area, is corrosive resistant and is molecularly very strong when integrated into materials. 

First discovered in the 1940s however not researched further until 2004 by two scientists that were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their work, Graphene adoption in products is just beginning to take notable hold. The global graphene market capitalisation is projected to reach $2.5b by 2028 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.5% for the next 6 years.

# GMG’s Graphene Production

First and foremost, GMG’s core operation is the internal production of high-quality Graphene. Manufactured through their unique patented technology process, their material is distinctively different from Graphene produced from traditional methods. GMG’s process only requires low-cost natural gas as feedstock which is then converted through the electric plasma into Carbon (Graphene) and Hydrogen. 

https://preview.redd.it/qztggk2pxc7a1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d80d57cac2b82ef7e54a6af9dc60293dc103497

The company’s production process can be fully automated with production being instantaneous and continuous, requiring low-cost inputs and setup costs, an ability to quickly scale the production facilities, the end product can be definitely controlled to certain desired output metrics, consistently high-quality graphene and the overall process has a low environmental impact. The end product is some of the purest carbon ever created, free from contaminants such as oxygen and silicon. 

https://preview.redd.it/cqinlx6qxc7a1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3835b916ab0aa90be86b9426a04a7ea78f0e291

Conventional production methods for the material require Graphite to be mined which is then chemically processed and refined numerous times into Graphene Oxide. There are numerous downfalls to this practice, which GMG has been able to mitigate, including the environmental impacts plus mining cost of extracting Graphite, the high Graphene production costs and setup due to needing to process the ore numerous times, difficulty in achieving mass-scale production, there are only various forms of definability, there are often impurities in the graphene oxide and the chemical processing of the Graphite creates a large environmental footprint.

An added benefit for the company is that GMG’s production methods also create the by-product of hydrogen which the company has stated that they will either use to power their manufacturing equipment or sell on the open market. GMG also has future ambitions to extract Carbon from Carbon Dioxide in the air however at the moment production through Methan is most suitable given its cost and abundance.

### Graphene Production Costs

The example below will provide an estimated cost structure of GMG’s Graphene production: 

The price of 20 kgs of Natural Gas can cost anywhere between US$5-20, largely depending on where in the world the gas is obtained. In this example, we will use the upper end of the gas price spectrum being US$20. Out of the 20kgs, roughly 15 kgs are carbon atoms. So for every 1 kg of carbon atoms, the price of gas is US$1.30 which is extremely cheap.

GMG’s production process also uses electricity, which the company can renewably generate from Solar Panels in their warehouse facilities as well as convert the Hydrogen by-product into electricity.

GMG is currently preparing for the construction of its Phase 1 Graphene production expansion with the warehouse facilities expected to be complete in the first half of 2023. This warehouse will also provide dedicated space for the company’s blending division operations (more on this later).

The company intends to exclusively use their Graphene for their suite of productions rather than directly selling its Graphene sheets on the open market.

# Graphene Manufacturing Groups Products

## Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery - US$108b Market

This is the most exciting application for GMG’s Graphene. The company reached an exclusive license agreement with the University of Queensland (UQ), the original developers of the battery storage technology, thanks to GMG’s ultra-high-quality and low-environmental footprint Graphene. The agreement was signed for an initial 20 years however there may be an optionality to extend the arrangement which mostly depends on the life of the patents for which UQ has already globally filed.

UQ has developed a specific process that perforates and splits the layers of graphene creating expanded inter-layer spatial distance (holes) in the atoms. Their approach enables a greater amount of Aluminium-Ions to be stored in more kgs of carbon, resulting in a greater energy density for the Graphene Aluminium-Ion (G+AI) batteries.

So far, extensive testing of the battery has provided extremely positive data which exceeds Lithium-Ion battery capabilities. GMG in partnership with UQ professors, continues to expand the capabilities of the battery technology and has announced numerous improvements. The results achieved by GMG have been independently verified and the company has already delivered samples of both the 2032 coin-cell battery and Battery Pouch Cell to interested parties. 

The company has stated they have been inundated with inquiries from numerous Tier 1s, 2s and 3s across multiple industries who want to assess the battery capabilities themselves. Both the 2032 coin cell and pouch cell batteries have the potential to be applied in numerous applications Remotes/IOT Devices, personal electronics, household and grid storage as well as electric vehicles and aviation.

## 2032 Type G+AI Battery Coin Cell

Currently, the 2032 type G+AI Battery Coin cell is the most developed battery technology that GMG carries which can be used in a range of products including remote controls, games and toys, calculators, watches, weighing scales, cameras and computer motherboards. 

  


https://preview.redd.it/t2cod5zrxc7a1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b8b5dfe24c3f41a38cc65dbcf172fe17e63ffdc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xx02ldhsxc7a1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d140c2a101c541c521504ec5242691d0584f9af

GMG’s 2032 type coin cell prototypes are fully rechargeable in several seconds, retain the capacity for several thousand charges and discharge cycles, are non-flammable, are relatively non-toxic and are virtually fully recyclable. These features compare favorably against the typical 2032 type Lithium-Ion coin cells which take 3-6 hours to recharge, are highly toxic and in some cases deadly. when ingested, are difficult to recycle, are flammable under certain conditions, and degrade more rapidly in performance.

With most of the battery research complete, the company is in the advanced stages of determining the pricing structure, potential quantity of production per annum and layout design of a future production facility. GMG is expected to make their final investment decision for a battery production facility in the latter half of 2023 with hopes of full-scale production and sales in 2024.

## G+AI Battery Pouch Cell

Currently, in the late stages of development, GMG’s Battery pouch cells are extremely versatile and could be used in a range of products from EVs, personal communication devices,  internet of things (IOT) sensors, energy storage, high power industrial applications and electrical aviation. As seen in the picture below, the pouch cells are highly malleable in their shape design allowing customers to receive a battery with certain design specifications (shape, energy density etc).

GMG began hand manufacturing their first pouch cell batteries in September 2022 and has since sent numerous samples to interested parties. GMG works in a collaborative manner with their interested companies, firstly specifying the desired power density and energy density and then reaching a user specification agreement where GMG will send samples for the company to extensively study. Whilst the company has been inundated with sample requests, GMG’s board is assessing which product segment they want to first launch with and which client they want to serve.

## G+AI Batteries vs. Lithium-Ion Batteries

Although the specifications for the G+AI batteries are currently impressive, given how state-of-the-art UQ’s technology is, there is the capacity for further optimisation.

As of June 2021, GMG had more than 80 global companies request samples to assess the potential applications of the battery in electric consumer vehicles, high-performance cars, heavy-duty vehicles, motorbikes, air transport, personal appliances such as laptop computers and phones, grid-connected storage, and others.

The following paragraphs compare the G+AI battery to Lithium-Ion batteries:

**Energy &amp; Power Density**

Lithium-Ion batteries only use 1 lithium atom when the energy is discharged whereas G+AI batteries have 3 electrons for use meaning that for every single positive charge transported between the anode and cathode in a Lithium battery, GMG’s battery can charge 3 electrodes at the same time. This ability greatly increases the energy density of the G+AI battery. GMG’s battery is also labeled as a hybrid-supercapacitor meaning that it has very low internal resistance so practically every amount of power that is put into the battery will go into the capacity space.

Energy density equates to how much energy you can get out of a single charge. In the case of EVs, it is how many miles you can drive, for your phone it's hours of use. Currently, GMG’s energy density is below Lithium-Ion batteries however keep in mind that Lithium-Ion batteries have had 30+ years to mature, whereas GMG's batteries are still GEN 1. Aluminum has one of the highest theoretical energy densities, at 1060 Wh/kg, which is 2.6x greater than Lithium ion's theoretical max 406 Wh/kg limit. Most notably, GMG is currently only using just 1 of their 3 aluminum atom electrons. The company is currently working on the ability to use all 3 and the results so far are extremely encouraging. This would arguably increase the energy density of the battery by 3 times.

In terms of power density, the G+AI battery has extremely high charging abilities with rates up to 9,350 W/kG u/30c. In comparison, a Lithium-Ion battery's power density is only 200W/kG u/1c. The G+AI power density is so high that a standard phone can be fully charged in under 3 minutes. When you charge a lithium-ion battery beyond its power density capabilities, problems begin to arise. To combat this from occurring, there are numerous battery management systems in place to manage the charge current. This not only adds additional weight to battery packs but also costs more to implement.

https://preview.redd.it/qdk4xd8xxc7a1.png?width=1596&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c70e62c3323bc839523fbceccc091c39f5b6f4a

**Battery Life Cycle**

Most batteries lose 15-20% of the atoms that come in and out of the electrode holes, an effect called roundtrip efficiency. Both Lithium-Ion and G+AI suffer from this effect however what differentiates the two is that after so many uses, lithium atoms begin to lodge themselves in the receiving electrode which builds up over time lessening the effect of the charging capacity. This is why we need to update our phones every 3-4 years, as the battery storage efficiency begins to decrease. GMG's G+AI battery doesn't suffer as harshly from this lessening efficiency effect over time. The battery has been shown to effectively operate over 3,000 cycles compared to Lithium-Ion’s 600-1,000 cycles. This is a very significant benefit!

https://preview.redd.it/cgbz46ayxc7a1.png?width=1504&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cd5dfe3b01b52410cb49d1dc77691e307306ce

**Voltage**

The battery has a discharge capacity of 360mAh/gram and a nominal voltage of 2.0V. 

One of the biggest downfalls of the G+AI 2032 battery is that it can only reach 2.0V and not the desired 3.0V however the company is making good headway on increasing the battery's voltage. The company is currently developing ways to increase the voltage, mainly through increasing the electron usage from 1 to 3. Achieving specific voltage is not currently an issue as the company can just stack batteries on top of each other to achieve the desired voltage output though achieving 3.0V would be a massive derisking factor for the battery technology.

**Temperature &amp; Cooling System Management**

As Graphene and Aluminium have fantastic thermal conductivity, larger battery packs could require no cooling system which would allow for a 95% cell-to-pack density ratio. In comparison, Tesla's battery packs have a cell-to-pack ratio density ratio of 63.5%. G+AI battery packs also wouldn’t carry the additional management system equipment required to cool down the batteries.

During the initial lay test in cold weather conditions, GMG’s battery showed no performance deterioration at 0 degrees. The company has recently acquired professional test kits that will test the battery performance in temperature ranges between 0 and 100 degrees. So far, testing has shown there is no difference in battery pack temperature when charging at extremely fast rates. 

**Cost &amp; Supply Chain** 

The G+AI battery is made from 50% Graphene, which GMG can produce through their graphene production facility and 50% Aluminum which is thousands of times more abundant and more cost-effective than lithium. This will allow the G+AI battery to be extremely cost-competitive, in most cases far cheaper when compared to Lithium-Ion batteries. Recently highlighted by Lithium’s skyrocketing price, the cost of obtaining lithium feedstock for batteries will cause significant price increases for the consumer products which require lithium batteries. Not to mention, Lithium-Ion batteries also require copper, cobalt, magnesium and rare earth metals. Only requiring cheap natural gas as well as electricity for the conversion process, GMG’s supply chain is extremely uncomplicated and economical when compared to Lithium-Ion batteries.

**Green &amp; Recycling**

GMG’s batteries are much greener than Lithium-Ion batteries due to the reduced mining practice needed to obtain the feedstock. G+AI Batteries can also be easily recycled after many years of use and currently, there are highly efficient facilities in place to recycle aluminum. 

GMG also produces their batteries in a way that allows the Aluminium and Graphene atoms to be easily withdrawn. The Graphene materials can be used again and the Aluminium can be easily recycled. In contrast, it is not only difficult but extremely costly to recycle Lithium-Ion batteries.

### Graphene Aluminium-Ion Limiting Factors

So far, all the metrics of Graphene Aluminium-Ion batteries have far out-weighted lithium-ion batteries yet there are still limiting factors hindering the technology.

The ultimate hindrance comes down to the quality of and ability to consistently produce the graphene used in Graphene Aluminium-Ion batteries. The atom structure of the graphene must be layered in such a way that the battery can effectively charge and discharge the aluminum-ion atoms. Poor-quality graphene will hinder this process.

GMG produces some of the highest quality graphenes in the market, and year after year they continue to improve their graphene output. Whilst there are many types of graphene, the state's company has formed the best graphene for battery technology and continues to optimize the metrics.

### Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery Production Costs

The process to manufacture GMG’s G+AI battery follows in extreme similarity to how Lithium-Ion batteries are currently produced. Lithium-Ion battery production requires 12 machines, which are well technologically developed with 40 companies worldwide supplying such machines. GMG has refined their manufacturing process around existing technologies, only requiring 9 of the 12 Lithium-Ion battery production machines to manufacture their battery.

The company’s CEO, Craig Nicol, expects that once their energy savings solutions, such as the use of solar panels or the Hydrogen Slag, are taken into account the company will one day be able to prove they are a carbon-negative business.

**Potential for Licensing Agreements**

GMG’s board has not yet decided as to whether they will adopt a licensing agreement model for the production of their batteries as they want to see how the battery and market matures. Licensing agreements would only appear once they have achieved a full-scale production line, as well as further, derisked the battery technology to show that the battery is commercially viable. For current Lithium-Ion battery production companies to transition to manufacturing GMG’s G+AI battery, they would only need to clean and scrub their facilities as the equipment used to produce the batteries are identical.

## Thermal-XR - US$26b Market

Thermal-XR is a Graphene coating applied to the surface of Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units. The coating generates energy savings, reduces emissions, adds Corrosion Protection, and increases the Thermal Efficiency of the HVAC units. Considering that approximately 10% of global energy usage is consumed in running HVAC units, there is a significant potential for global emission reductions through the use of Thermal-XR.

https://preview.redd.it/swpg1ji2yc7a1.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d147ebc118e8f8cd104b5fba520894b698107829

Research undertaken by GMG and independent 3rd parties has shown that after coating a range of HVAC units across the world, energy savings of between 8-52% were achieved. Insights regarding regional climate conditions, the type of HVAC units, and economic parameters continue to be derived and are being used to prioritize subsequent research efforts. Recent verification by the Univeristy of Queensland confirmed that GMG’s Thermal-XR can reduce surface temperature by approx. 15% when applied to aluminium with temperatures between 70C and 90C.

https://preview.redd.it/onudoly3yc7a1.png?width=1774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ddaf0840b4d69f41816cc64351fcbfcd7d916af

Thermal-XR’s patented technology was originally developed by OzKem, an Australian corrosive protection technology company, however, in August 2022, GMG acquired the intellectual property, branding rights and distribution of the product. The agreement still sees OzChem supplying the underlying coating however GMG will integrate their graphene into the product at their blending manufacturing facility. By acquiring this technology, GMG can optimize the coating blend as per clients' requests more effectively.

Currently, GMG is assessing the different routes to market for its Thermal-XR product. These include the coating being applied on existing aircon by HVAC installations, applying the coating to the HVAC distribution network, as well as integrating the coating into the equipment manufacturing line. Additional applications can be made towards oil and gas production, power generation, liquified natural gas production, mining, and mineral processing. GMG in conjunction with potential customers has begun applying Thermal-XR to the equipment manufacturing process which represents a potentially significant revenue opportunity.

GMG has established sales representatives across North America, South East Asia and Australia. The company has also been in consultation with a company in Dubai, which shows promising revenue potential.

## Lubricant - US$14b Market

GMG’s manufactured Graphene can also be dispersed as an additive in oil related lubricants such as automobile lubricants and heavy machinery coolants. 

https://preview.redd.it/tuegtw65yc7a1.jpg?width=451&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7c26d7ebef6ae5841e5a6e8d04349a7f8dff0a

Numerous research papers have illustrated the benefits of including Graphene in oil lubricants, namely related to energy and emission savings, wear prevention and increasing asset longevity. GMG has begun conducting their research and found that when their Graphene is added, there are energy savings of up to 12%, there is a coefficient of friction reduction of up to 30% and reductions of wear of up to 20%.

The Graphene concentrate can be added to existing lubricants or GMG can tailor a specific concentrate for client requests. The Graphene material generally only consists of 1% of the weight within the oils.

Product engagement is currently occurring, with commercial potential largely based on customer acceptance of the data results. Several large lubricant blending companies and original equipment manufacturers are currently either testing or have expressed interest in testing GMG’s product. Craig Nicol, the Founder and CEO of GMG, previously worked for Shell in the Lubricant Oil business so can capitalize on his industry connections and knowledge

# Company Partnerships

To ensure an effective route to commercialisation, the company has signed non-binding letters of intent with a ‘coalition of the willing’:

### Wood

GMG has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Wood, a global consulting and engineering energy firm. Wood will support GMG in scaling up and automating its proprietary natural gas to the graphene manufacturing process.

### Bosch

GMG has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Bosch, where once GMG achieves a successful commercial battery prototype, sales agreements and the final investment decision is made, Bosch will design, construct and operate a G+AI Battery manufacturing plant. The location of the plant is still being considered but is likely to reside in Australia.

### Rio Tinto

GMG also has signed a non-binding letter of intent with Rio Tinto where both parties will explore the use of GMG's energy savings products in Rio's operations, explore working together to support GMG's development of their G+AI batteries as well as collaborate on mining and other industrial applications. 

Everything on a mine site can be electrified and GMG could provide the necessary product offerings for Rio Tinto’s mining equipment suppliers. GMG is already in discussions with multiple mining equipment suppliers that can utilize GMG’s products on-site and provide evidence that they can work under high-performance and high heat environments.

The non-binding letter also allows GMG to explore the optionality of acquiring Rio Tinto’s Aluminium materials for the production of their batteries  


# GMG Facilities

In December 2021, GMG commissioned a battery pilot product and testing facility in Queensland, Australia.

This facility has allowed GMG to develop, manufacture and test their 2032 type G+AI coin cell and pouch pack batteries in-house, accelerate the commercial potential of their battery, work with future customers and further expand their staff members. GMG has ambitions, following a positive final investment decision in 2023 to construct an initial 2032 type G+AI coin cell battery manufacturing facility, followed by first production and sales in 2024.

The company has also boosted their organizational capabilities through attracting new staff experienced in coin cell and pouch cell research and manufacturing which will accelerate their battery performance optimisation programme.

# Risks

### Technical Derisking

Most of the Company’s products and solutions are currently in research and development, and the commercialization phase, at various stages of progression. There is a risk that the technology and the Company's products will not perform as expected in certain applications and therefore, GMG may encounter delays to commercialization or may run the risk that the technologies will never be successfully commercialized. This means that the Company may never receive revenues or return on its research and development activities.

### Introduction of Competing Technologies/Products

Given that the energy savings and energy storage space are so wide, competitors are the companies that have graphene-enhanced products. Although GMG has stated they don’t see any meaningful competition currently in its target markets, the following companies could be seen as competitors:

* Applied Graphene Materials: Focuses on composites, coatings, lubricants, thermal management solutions and batteries and energy storage devices. 
* First Graphene: Manufactures graphene using graphite, and has a product range that is focused on composites, elastomers, fire retardancy, construction materials, graphene-enhanced textiles and energy storage devices.
* Global Graphene Group: Focuses on thermal coatings and paints, conductive coatings and inks, anti corrosion primers, graphene-enabled silicon anodes, Li-Ion battery materials and non-inflammable electrolytes. 
* HydroGraph: A publicly traded nanotechnology company that produces graphene in the most scalable, low-cost, customizable manner.
* Haydale: Doesn’t produce graphene but rather focuses on the integration of graphene in materials and products.
* Versarien: Has numerous subsidiaries and is mainly focused on graphene integration into products.
* Zen Graphene: Specializes in the production and integration of graphene powder.
* Nanoxplore: Produces graphene power and graphene-based plastics for industrial applications

Note this list doesn’t include all the different battery type competitors in the space which there are many. There will be numerous other companies that will enter the space however given how broad the market is there is unlimited potential

*Marketing Acceptance*

Even when product development is successful, GMG’s ability to generate significant revenue and profits depends on the acceptance of its products by its customers and end users of the products.

Theinformation contained withinthis announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations(EU) No. 596/2014 ('MAR') which has been incorporated into UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Upon the publicationof this announcementvia Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.

**About Maginito**

Maginito is focused on developing green technology opportunities in the rare earths supply chain, encompassing neodymium (NdFeB) magnet recycling as well as innovative rare earth alloy, magnet, and separation technologies.

Maginito holds a 42% interest in UK rare earth (NdFeB) magnet recycler, HyProMag ([www.hypromag.com](https://pr.report/OJSQrH70)) with an option to increase its interest to 49%. Hypromag has licensed the patented technology called HPMS (Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scrap) developed in the Magnetic Materials Group (MMG) at the University of Birmingham.

HyProMag's strategy is to establish short loop recycling facilities for NdFeB magnets at Tyseley Energy Park in Birmingham, U.K. (the ""Tyseley Recycling Facilities"") and other locations to provide a sustainable solution for the supply of NdFeB magnets and alloys for a wide range of markets including, for example, automotive and electronics. The plant at Tyseley Energy Park is being developed together with the University of Birmingham, with a minimum capacity of 100tpa NdFeB (neodymium, iron, boron) and first production is targeted for 2023. This £4.3 million project is being funded by Driving the Electric Revolution, an Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund challenge delivered by UK Research and Innovation (""UKRI"").

In November 2021, HyProMag established an 80%-owned subsidiary in Germany, HyProMag GmbH, to rollout commercialisation of HPMS technology into Germany and Europe. HyProMag GmbH is developing a similar sized plant to that at Tyseley Energy Park (the ""HyProMag GmbH Recycling Facility""). Initial capacity is expected to be a minimum of 100tpa NdFeB, comprising recycled rare earth sintered magnets and alloys and will be the first in Germany using the patented HPMS process, with first production targeted for 2024. Maginito has entered into a convertible loan agreement (the ""HyProMag GmbH Convertible Loan"") with HyProMag GmbH, to acquire up to a 50% interest. Under the terms of the HyProMag GmbH Convertible Loan, Maginito has granted HyProMag GmbH a loan facility for €2.5 million (approximately C$3.6 million) available to be drawn down in accordance with an agreed investment plan and convertible into a 50% interest in HyProMag GmbH.

This investment by Maginito (which will be funded in part by proceeds from Mkango's recently completed £3.5 million placing) will contribute to the matched funding requirements to unlock the €3.7 million (approximately C$5.3 million) grants announced by Mkango on November 23, 2022, for development of the production facility in Baden-Württemberg State.

Mkango UK is establishing a pilot plant at Tyseley Energy Park (the ""Mkango UK Pilot Plant"") to chemically process recycled HPMS NdFeB powder and magnet swarf (i.e. the powder produced from grinding and finishing magnets) from a range of scrap sources including electronic waste, electric motors and wind turbines, complementing the short loop magnet recycling routes being developed in parallel by HyProMag. The £1.1 million pilot plant programme is being developed as part of the SCREAM Project ([https://scream-uk.com/](https://scream-uk.com/)). 70% of the costs are being funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) as part of the Driving the Electric Revolution challenge.

**About Mkango**

Mkango's corporate strategy is to develop new sustainable primary and secondary sources of neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium to supply accelerating demand from electric vehicles, wind turbines and other clean technologies. This integrated Mine, Refine, Recycle strategy differentiates Mkango from its peers, uniquely positioning the Company in the rare earths sector. Mkango is listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange (""AIM"") and the TSX Venture Exchange (""TSX-V"").

In a world where speed and precision are the cornerstones of modern warfare, the recent test of the **Dark Eagle hypersonic missile** by the US Department of Defense signifies a monumental leap forward. Conducted in secrecy at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, this test represents a pivotal moment in military technology. With its ability to travel at an astonishing *3,800 miles per hour*, the Dark Eagle missile can reach global targets within mere minutes, posing new strategic challenges and opportunities. This article delves into the implications of this groundbreaking technology, exploring the secrecy surrounding the test, the capabilities of hypersonic weapons, and their potential impact on global security.

# The Secretive Dark Eagle Launch

The **Dark Eagle launch** was shrouded in secrecy, reflecting the sensitive nature of hypersonic weapon testing. The US Department of Defense provided minimal information about the mission, citing national security concerns. A spokesperson mentioned that a collaborative team, including government, academic, and industry partners, was involved in the test at Cape Canaveral. Despite the lack of public announcement, a navigational warning from the US Coast Guard hinted at the activity, establishing a security zone in the Atlantic to ensure safe testing conditions.

The Dark Eagle’s capabilities are truly remarkable. With a speed of approximately Mach 5—five times the speed of sound—and a range of 1,725 miles, the missile demonstrates the US military’s commitment to maintaining technological superiority. This test marks the second hypersonic trial at Cape Canaveral, following an initial test in December of the previous year. The implications of such tests go beyond mere technical achievements, raising questions about international security dynamics and defense strategies.

# New Hypersonic Capabilities

Hypersonic weapons are rapidly becoming a focal point for the world’s military powers, offering unprecedented advantages in speed and reach. The **US Army** describes the Dark Eagle as a land-based, truck-launched system capable of evading traditional air and missile defenses. Its ability to travel beyond the atmosphere and strike with little warning makes it a formidable tool for deterrence and rapid response.

Each Dark Eagle unit is slated to consist of four launchers and eight missiles, with deployment expected by the fiscal year 2025. Although development has been delayed by two years, the strategic benefits are clear. As Patrick Mason, a senior US official, noted, hypersonic weapons complicate adversaries’ decision-making processes, enhancing deterrence. The speed, accuracy, and adaptability of these systems align perfectly with their evocative name, *Dark Eagle*.

# Global Security Implications

The introduction of hypersonic weapons like the Dark Eagle is set to redefine global security paradigms. These weapons can strike anywhere in the world within minutes, rendering traditional defense systems obsolete. As military powers race to develop comparable technologies, the potential for a new arms race looms large. The US Navy is also exploring hypersonic capabilities, aiming to implement a system called **Conventional Prompt Strike** on its naval vessels, further expanding the reach and versatility of hypersonic technology.

While hypersonic weapons offer strategic advantages, they also pose significant risks. The lack of reaction time and the difficulty in intercepting such fast-moving targets increase the likelihood of rapid escalation in conflicts. As nations navigate this new era of military technology, the need for international cooperation and arms control agreements becomes increasingly apparent.

# The Future of Hypersonic Weaponry

The Dark Eagle represents just the beginning of what could be a transformative era in military technology. As hypersonic weapons become integral to national defense strategies, the balance of power may shift in unforeseen ways. The US is not alone in its pursuit of hypersonic capabilities; other nations are investing heavily in similar technologies, driving innovation and competition.

As the military landscape evolves, the questions surrounding the ethical and strategic use of hypersonic weapons grow more pressing. How will international treaties and agreements adapt to this new reality? Will the development of these technologies lead to enhanced global security or increased instability? As we stand on the brink of this new age, one must ponder: how will the world respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by hypersonic weapons?

https://preview.redd.it/dqv5o3hr1kye1.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7bbc8a0dd1c7f31748d6e9be2dba895b6b2d95

The U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs is continuing on the path toward the nation's first sea-based hypersonic fielding with a successful end-to-end flight test of a conventional hypersonic missile from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. This test marked the first launch of the Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) capability utilizing the Navy's cold-gas launch approach that will be used in Navy sea-based platform fielding.  
  
""The speed, range, and survivability of hypersonic weapons are key to integrated deterrence for America,"" Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said. ""When fielded, Conventional Prompt Strike will deliver unmatched capabilities to our warfighters.""

This test was the next step in the Navy's flight testing program of the common All Up Round (AUR) that is being developed in partnership with the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office. In 2024, the programs completed two additional end-to-end flight tests of the AUR that will be fielded to both the Navy and Army.  
  
""The cold-gas approach allows the Navy to eject the missile from the platform and achieve a safe distance above the ship prior to first stage ignition. This technical achievement brings SSP one step closer to fulfilling our role of providing a safe and reliable hypersonic capability to our Navy,"" said Vice Adm. Johnny R. Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, which is the lead designer of the common hypersonic missile.  
  
The CPS Program has been diligently planning and executing engineering and test efforts to prepare for the first Navy fielding aboard the USS ZUMWALT. Utilizing an In-Air Launch test facility, the Program conducted an extensive test campaign to validate the launch approach prior to the completion of this flight test. Information gathered from this test will inform the continued development and production of the AUR and the first use of this cold-gas launch approach on a surface ship platform.  
  
The rapid development and demonstration of conventional sea-based hypersonic strike weapon systems supports the U.S.'s ability to deter, and if necessary, defeat potential strategic competitors. The range, accuracy, lethality, and survivability of hypersonics is a significant leap-ahead in U.S. conventional strike capabilities, complementing existing capabilities and enabling the U.S. to defeat adversary high-end capabilities.

# March 2024 (about a year ago) ~Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere’s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle

[Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere’s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hypersonic-hegemony-niobium-and-western-hemispheres-role-us-china-power-struggle)

https://preview.redd.it/yingyix82kye1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae50c3eb20cfa0e1d91eb669566c33c4eadfd1fe

# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of global defense, the arms race has metamorphosed from a contest of nuclear might to one of unparalleled speed. [Hypersonic weapons](https://www.csis.org/analysis/complex-air-defense-countering-hypersonic-missile-threat) (capable of exceeding [five times the speed of sound](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)), promise to revolutionize modern warfare.

China's strides in the hypersonic field are a manifestation of its broader strategic intentions and underscore its drive toward technological and military preeminence. This journey toward mastering hypersonic technology is not merely for show; it is about redefining the global balance of military power.

A successful deployment of these weapons would enable China to redefine the term “first-strike advantage.” Such a capability is not merely about striking first; it is about striking in a manner that leaves the opponent minimal time or capacity to react, effectively nullifying their defensive postures. This introduces a dangerous paradigm wherein the traditional cushion of time provided by early warning systems is drastically reduced. For the United States, this might mean that even with the world's most advanced detection systems, the [window to act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45811/35) could be so minimal that it might be rendered ineffective. As the United States and China jostle for dominance in this arena, the strategic significance of an elemental material, niobium, emerges as a pivotal concern, and with it, China’s rising dominance in the Western Hemisphere’s mining sector.

# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel

Vacuum-grade niobium’s [role](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/) in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures [over 2,400 degrees Celsius,](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/) renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium’s pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a [high strength-to-weight ratio](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/), which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like [SpaceX and Hermeus](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/) depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.

For decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic [Gemini and Apollo](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474) programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since [1959](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf). This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated [8,800 metric tons](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/) imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from [Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/). This heavy reliance on just two primary sources—both neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere—exposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China’s dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.

# China’s Stake in Brazil’s Mineral Monopoly

Brazil dominated global niobium production in 2020, accounting for over [91 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316) of production. With reserves estimated at [842 million metric tons](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/), Brazil produces roughly [120,000 metric tons annually](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/). Brazil’s high production comes from large mines such as [Araxá and Catalão](https://www.cradleresources.com.au/what-is-niobium/), with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração (CBMM) controlling [75 percent of Brazil’s output](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/).

China has recognized the potential of niobium for over a decade. In 2011, a consortium of [five Chinese companies](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/) acquired a 15 percent stake in CBMM. This engagement intensified in 2016 when China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. (now known only as CMOC) secured ownership of the [Chapadão and Boa Vista mines](https://dialogochino.net/en/extractive-industries/25588-niobiums-silent-impact-in-brazil/), further strengthening China's position in the niobium market.

The importance of niobium was further highlighted in the Brazilian political arena in 2018. Then presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro emphasized niobium's role in Brazil's “[economic independence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-china-niobium/hands-off-brazils-niobium-bolsonaro-sees-china-as-threat-to-utopian-vision-idUSKCN1MZ1JN/).” Despite Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric focusing on safeguarding this critical commodity from foreign control and advocating for its national governance, Chinese influence in the Brazilian niobium sector continued to grow. By 2020, Chinese entities controlled approximately [26 percent of Brazil's niobium production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316). This control not only ensures China's preferential access and influence over pricing dynamics in the niobium supply chain, but also positions it advantageously in a global context.

China managed to maintain and even strengthen its position at the subnational level under Bolsonaro. CMOC for instance provided [$1.2 million](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/04/brazils-economic-ties-china-flourish-despite-political-shifts) in Covid-19 aid to the city of Catalão, demonstrating China's strategic engagement beyond mere commercial interests.

China’s influence over Brazil’s niobium production conforms to a [pattern](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/) of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the [second most critical of 50 minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072), falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth.

# Defense Implications

China's hypersonic resolve has been remarkable. By 2018, it had [conducted over 20 times](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf) as many tests as the United States. According to the Pentagon, the United States is [still lagging.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/04/18/pentagon-yes-we-are-still-lagging-behind-chinas-hypersonics/) This hypersonic prowess, combined with China's stranglehold on niobium, places the United States in a perilous position.

The strategic importance of niobium in next-generation defense systems cannot be overstated. As the U.S. military and its defense contractors increasingly rely on niobium-based superalloys to produce a wide range of equipment, from aircraft components to hypersonic missile systems, any disruption in the niobium supply chain could have significant repercussions.

Overall, China's growing influence and control over critical mineral supply chains poses a distinct challenge. Under the Biden administration, the United States and the European Union placed export controls and restrictions on strategic and critical minerals to curb China’s dominance in [artificial intelligence and semiconductors](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-to-make-of-chinas-latest-restrictions-on-critical-mineral-exports/). In retaliation, China imposed their own limitations on [gallium, germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-flexes-critical-metals-muscles-with-export-curbs-2023-07-10/), and [graphite](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/) throughout 2023. A recent analysis by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions#:~:text=China%20produces%2090%20percent%20of,90%20percent%20of%20global%20graphite.) highlighted that China controls 90 percent of global gallium supplies, 90 percent of graphite, and 60 percent of germanium, all critical to the production of chips and electric vehicle batteries. The critical mineral supply chain has arrived at the forefront of strategic competition between the West and the People’s Republic of China.

China’s grip on the production, distribution, and pricing of niobium presents another layer of complexity: manipulating niobium’s availability to other nations. For the United States, already grappling with the challenges of overdependence on external sources for critical minerals, such a disruption could translate into significant production delays. The consequences could be serious: slower production of critical defense equipment, increased costs due to the potential need for alternative materials, and a cascading effect on existing machinery's maintenance and upgrade cycles. In this highly complex environment where timely responses to emerging threats are vital, these delays could hinder the United States' ability to promptly deploy or develop necessary defense systems.

# U.S. Countermeasures

Facing such formidable challenges, the United States cannot afford to remain a passive observer. Safeguarding its strategic interests and maintaining its global position demands a comprehensive and multifaceted critical mineral strategy, particularly in securing niobium supplies.

**Including Brazil in the MSP**

Incorporating Brazil into the 13-nation [Mineral Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) could significantly fortify the global niobium supply chain. The MSP represents a concerted multinational endeavor to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and bolster investments in critical mineral supply chains, an initiative that aligns well with the strategic interests of both Brazil and the broader international community. Brazil’s inclusion would make it the first Latin American country to enter the partnership, signaling its regional leadership and increase in international stature. The integration of Brazil into this partnership is particularly strategic, considering its substantial niobium reserves, in addition to its other critical mineral deposits. This move would add a robust layer of security against potential supply disruptions.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, with its strong emphasis on ESG standards, is likely to find the MSP's principles congruent with its [policy priorities](https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/363907-will-lula-be-brazils-environmental-saviour/). The MSP’s emphasis on elevating global standards in these areas could resonate with Lula’s progressive agenda, potentially making Brazil’s participation both beneficial and attractive.

Furthermore, Brazil's inclusion in the MSP would facilitate its adherence to a framework that advocates for the diversification and stabilization of mineral supply chains. This alignment could be instrumental in mitigating China’s dominant influence in the niobium market. By joining the MSP, Brazil would not only assert its role in the global mineral economy but also contribute to a more balanced and less vulnerable critical mineral supply landscape, including niobium.

Diversification of Niobium Sources

Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue. The [Elk Creek project](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states) in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act [calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/), and “encourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.”

However, to comprehensively mitigate the risks associated with niobium supply, the United States should extend its strategy beyond domestic projects. Engaging in international partnerships, especially with Canadian, African, and European nations that have niobium reserves, is crucial.

Canada’s significant niobium reserves stands as an ideal partner to strengthen North American supply security. The geographical proximity of Canada to the United States offers logistical advantages, reducing transportation costs and environmental impact. Additionally, the strong political and economic ties between the United States and Canada could facilitate smoother bilateral agreements and joint ventures in niobium exploration and development.

Africa’s rich mineral resources, and Europe’s advanced mining technologies and regulatory frameworks, offer promising avenues for collaboration. These partnerships could lead to the exploration and development of new niobium sources, thus diversifying the global supply chain.

**Stockpiling and Strategic Reserves**

The practice of stockpiling and maintaining strategic reserves of strategic minerals serves as a crucial safeguard during times of geopolitical unrest or supply chain interruptions. Experts suggest that with its existing reserves of critical minerals, the United States may [face challenges in sustaining](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/) a protracted conflict with China. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS), designed to support the nation's needs for up to [four years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), is perceived by some as insufficient for the United States to execute its strategic military objectives effectively. Proactive measures to accumulate substantial reserves of niobium and other strategic minerals are imperative. While in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Congress appropriated [$218.5 million](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833) for total NDS acquisitions, it remains at an unsatisfactory level to support the nation’s needs. Congress should place more effort in supporting the NDS in the future. Strategic stockpiling must be revitalized to Cold War-era levels so that the United States maintains its capability to meet both economic and defense production demands, even under challenging global scenarios.

# Conclusion

In the grand chessboard of defense geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance. The intertwining of mineral control and technological advancements underscores the multifaceted nature of modern security threats. For the United States, addressing this dual challenge is not just about catching up in the hypersonic race or diversifying niobium sources, but about reimagining its strategic approach in a complex global landscape—one where the Western Hemisphere takes center stage. Recognizing and mitigating these vulnerabilities will be crucial in ensuring U.S. national security in the face of strategic competition. The stakes are high, and the game is evolving; proactive measures today will dictate the balance of power tomorrow.

*12-week drilling campaign in Nebraska, to launch later this month, is designed to support the conversion of a portion of the current indicated resource into measured resources and the subsequent conversion of a portion of the current probable mineral reserve into proven mineral reserves in an updated feasibility study*

*An updated feasibility study is necessary as part of the due diligence process of the application for debt financing NioCorp is seeking from the U.S. Export-Import Bank*

*NioCorp’s critical minerals project is designed to potentially produce certain critical minerals that China now threatens to withhold from the U.S. and Western allies*

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (April 22, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**) is launching a limited 9-hole drilling campaign later this month designed to support the conversion of a portion of its current Indicated Resources into Measured Resources and the subsequent conversion of a portion of its current Probable Mineral Reserves into Proven Mineral Reserves at its Nebraska-based Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the “**Elk Creek Project**”).

The drilling campaign will supplement previous exploratory drilling and will operate under existing permits issued by the State of Nebraska. The drilling campaign is intended to complement other technical and economic analyses necessary to update the feasibility study for the Elk Creek Project.  An updated feasibility study is necessary as part of the due diligence process for up to $800 million in potential debt financing that NioCorp is seeking from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (“**EXIM**”).

In addition to the updates to Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves update, NioCorp expects to finalize engineering of its new and more efficient production process which incorporates the potential addition of light and heavy magnetic rare earth oxides, the planned production of titanium in the form of titanium tetrachloride, and the potential to produce both ferroniobium and niobium oxide as commercial products.

“With China’s recent moves to restrict exports to the U.S. of heavy rare earths and other defense-critical minerals, it is all the more urgent to get strategic assets such as the Elk Creek Project to full financing, construction, and commercial operation as rapidly as possible,” said Mark A. Smith, Executive Chairman and CEO of NioCorp.  “To that end, we are excited to launch this drilling campaign in order to continue progressing our debt financing effort with EXIM and move this fully permitted Project forward to construction.”

# Rio Tinto's Strategic Pivot to Rare Earth Elements: Meeting Critical Mineral Demands

In an era of increasing technological advancement and energy transition, mining giant Rio Tinto is strategically positioning itself in the rare earths and critical minerals market. This move represents not just an opportunity for diversification but a response to changing global demands and geopolitical shifts in mineral security. While maintaining its traditional focus on iron ore, aluminum, and copper, Rio's venture into scandium and potential gallium production signals a new direction for one of the world's largest miners.

# What Are Rio Tinto's Plans for Rare Earth Elements?

Rio Tinto has begun establishing itself in the rare earth elements (REE) market, currently focusing on scandium production while exploring possibilities for gallium. Unlike some competitors pursuing aggressive acquisition strategies, Rio's approach is distinctly measured and demand-driven.

""We will only expand into rare earths if demand is clear,"" stated CEO Jacob Stausholm in a recent industry briefing, highlighting the company's pragmatic approach to this growing sector.

# Current Rare Earth Operations and Future Potential

Rio Tinto has successfully integrated scandium production into its existing operations, leveraging its technological expertise to extract this valuable element. Scandium, though produced in relatively small quantities, commands premium pricing due to its applications in:

* **Aerospace alloys** – Creating stronger, more corrosion-resistant materials
* **Solid oxide fuel cells** – Enhancing electrical conductivity and performance
* **Sports equipment** – Providing lightweight strength for high-performance gear

The company is also evaluating gallium production, which would complement its existing operations. Gallium has become increasingly critical for:

* Semiconductor manufacturing
* LED production
* 5G telecommunications infrastructure
* Solar panel production

This strategic positioning allows Rio Tinto to capitalize on growing demand for materials essential to technological advancement while utilizing existing operational frameworks.

# How Critical Minerals Fit Into Rio's Broader Strategy

While critical minerals operations remain relatively small compared to Rio's core business segments, Chairman Dominic Barton has emphasized their strategic importance, noting they could ""boost Rio's social license and supply chain resilience"" in an increasingly volatile global market.

The critical minerals strategy serves multiple objectives:

* **Portfolio diversification** – Reducing dependency on traditional commodities
* **ESG enhancement** – Supporting clean energy technologies and sustainability goals
* **Market positioning** – Establishing presence in high-growth sectors
* **Supply chain security** – Providing Western markets with alternatives to Chinese supply dominance

&gt;

Though relatively modest in scale compared to iron ore or aluminum, these operations position Rio Tinto advantageously in a world increasingly focused on mineral security and technological sovereignty.

This is the same game they played during the Iraq War when anyone who opposed Howard's invasion was portrayed as siding with “the terrorists”. Also, the same tactics employed during the January mega-fires when Murdoch attacked anyone raising climate change as a causative factor was attacked for “politicising” the crisis when, in Murdoch’s view, the cause was arson.

Sorry Rupert, but in this case criticising Scotty from Marketing isn't the same as having “acted in support of China” - as you now allege in your loyal factotum Ben English’s propaganda bulletin (aka The Daily Telegraph).

On the question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, the public record demonstrates that I signed an open letter together with 100 former US Secretaries of State, National Security Advisors and heads of other institutions on April 3 calling for such an international investigation – more than two weeks before Morrison ventilated his own ideas on this subject.

My main criticism of the Morrison proposal for an international inquiry was that it was advanced publicly without signing up other major co-sponsors from around the world beforehand. That would have put extra muscle behind the initiative. It would also have made it harder for Beijing to single out Australia for individual economic retribution, because there is strength in numbers.

A second criticism is that Morrison had not thought through the machinery for any such inquiry, also explicitly (and rightly) ruling out the WHO conducting an inquiry into Itself because it would be Caesar judging Caesar. Guess what! When Morrison finally figured out that his own “proposal” was not gaining international traction, he decided to save political face and swing in behind a pre-existing and much weaker European Union proposal to have the WHO organise its own inquiry with much softer terms of reference.

This brings us to the third weakness - which is the fact that if you look at the actual operative clauses of the World Health Assembly resolution on COVID-19, they don’t add up to much at all. There are two relevant clauses (9.6 and 9.10). One refers to the continuing work of existing international scientific bodies looking into the “zoonotic origins of the virus and the route of its introduction to the human population” - no reference to China, and no reference to any new investigation. The second refers to a new investigation by the WHO itself “at the earliest appropriate moment” into the “lessons learned” and “experience gained” from WHO‘s handling of the crisis. Indeed, elsewhere in the resolution, the World Health Assembly, supported by Australia, without qualification, commends the WHO for its work.

So this is the end result that Morrison now trumpets as the great success of his efforts in securing the robust, independent global investigation into the Chinese origins of the virus which would, under no circumstances, involve the WHO investigating itself! Give us a break! Another PR ploy from Scotty from Marketing. 

As for the deliberate smear that my challenging the truth of Murdoch’s bullshit claims are those of a “cheerleader for China”, Murdoch’s bullyboys might want to review what I’ve actually said during this COVID crisis. In just the last three days, I’ve said:

-- “Whatever is said by various spokesmen and women on behalf of the Chinese government, there are legitimate questions for the international community to know the answer to.” (BBC, 19 May)
-- “This is not a bunch of Sunday School teachers. This is a hard, hardened Soviet-style Leninist regime.” (New European, 19 May)
-- “We’re a liberal democracy that believes in universal human rights. That’s not going to change much as our Chinese friends may wish that.” (Eureka Report, 20 May)

Sorry none of that fits the script, Rupert. But never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.

I've always backed a hard-line policy on China. It's the Liberals who've changed their tune. When I was in office, they would join Murdoch's columnists in attacking me for being too hard on China. After all, it was my government that:
-- Rejected China’s determined efforts to take over Rio Tinto
-- Excluded Huawei hardware from being used in the NBN rollout
-- Spoke out about human rights abuses in Tibet and provided visas to dissidents from Xinjiang
-- Enhanced ASIO’s resources to deal with state-sponsored espionage
-- Formally identified China’s rise as a regional military challenge in the 2009 Defence White Paper
-- Partnered with Barack Obama to bring US Marines to Darwin, and
-- Beefed up the Royal Australian Navy in response to developments in the South China Sea.

Here is what The Australian wrote about my handling of the China relationship in September 2012: ""Rudd's leadership was characterised by the worst period in Sino-Australian relations for a decade or longer as he lectured China on Tibet, named the country as a threat in a Defence white paper and gave a visa to exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer. Canberra was seen as complicit in the failure of Chinalco to gain a bigger stake in Rio Tinto, amid intense friction between the two nations over iron ore prices and the jailing of Australian Rio executive Stern Hu.""

Back then, Murdoch was busy praising Tony Abbott for sacrificing Australia’s core values to ingratiate himself with Beijing. Business leaders like James Packer and Kerry Stokes, who viewed Australia’s national interest through the prism of how much money they can make, also attacked my handling of the relationship because we refused to kowtow. And who could forget Turnbull's famous opinion piece for Murdoch's Australian, attacking our defence white paper as that of a Cold War warrior, by claiming China is “not a security threat""?! Of course, Abbott and Turnbull later signed up to be Beijing's ""comprehensive strategic partner"" and they sacrificed key Australian negotiating positions to secure a trade agreement. They then handed the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company and reviewed the ban on Huawei equipment being used in the NBN rollout. But all this is now swept under the carpet by the giant Liberal Party protection racket that the Murdoch mafia have become.

So why have the Murdoch media launched this smear? It's so predictable. This is all retribution for me calling out the Murdoch media, in Australia and overseas, for claiming a non-existent “Five Eyes” intelligence dossier backed Donald Trump’s conspiracy claims that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory. Trump’s claimed evidence has been forcefully refuted by Australian spy agencies - and even by Greg Sheridan over at Murdoch’s Australian, who says: “All the relevant Australian agencies have looked closely at the question and consulted all their counterpart allied agencies, including in the US, and the end of that process is the Australian assessment is there is no evidence that the virus came from the lab.”

The Murdoch media’s overreach runs the real risk of backfiring, gifting a propaganda victory to Beijing if and when it is formally disproven. But Murdoch is so obsessed with backing Trump and his best mate Morrison that they’ll publish whatever weasel words they can get away with.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Aldebaran Resources Inc.** (“ **Aldebaran** ” or the “ **Company** ”) **(TSX-V: ALDE, OTCQX: ADBRF)** is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option to joint venture agreement (the “ **Option** **Agreement** ”) with Nuton Holdings Ltd. (“ **Nuton** ”), a Rio Tinto venture, whereby Nuton can acquire a 20% indirect interest in the Altar project by making staged payments totaling US$250 Million.

**Highlights**

* **Non-dilutive financing with an upfront payment of US$10 M**
* **US$20 M projected for Q4-2024 after the publication of an updated mineral resource estimate, if Nuton elects to proceed**
* **US$30 M payment projected for Q2/Q3-2025 after the publication of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) that includes a Nuton case, if Nuton elects to proceed**
* **Final Payment of US$190 M would be made after the publication of a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) that includes a Nuton case, expected in 2026, if Nuton elects to exercise the option**
* **Aldebaran is collaborating with Nuton to evaluate a Nuton** **TM** **Technologies sulphide leaching option in the upcoming PEA and PFS**
* **Nuton’s sulphide leaching technologies have the potential to materially improve the economics of the project**
* **Aldebaran remains the operator of the Altar project**

**John Black, Chief Executive Officer of Aldebaran, commented:** *“We’re pleased to have entered into this agreement with Nuton. This deal has many benefits to Aldebaran shareholders in that it provides for non-dilutive capital injections to fund future work programs on the Altar project through to completion of a PFS, if Nuton proceeds through each milestone. As well, Nuton’s proprietary sulphide leaching technologies could add significant value to the Altar project by reducing the costs and capital required for development. Our current plan for the PEA and PFS is to show both Nuton and non-Nuton cases.”*

**Adam Burley, Chief Executive Officer of Nuton, commented:** *“We’re pleased to enter into this agreement with Aldebaran, which provides us with an option to acquire an interest in a very large copper project in Altar. Successful deployment of Nuton Technologies at Altar has the potential to materially enhance the economic and environmental performance of the project.”*

**Status of Earn-In Agreement with Sibanye-Stillwater**

The Altar project is owned by Peregrine Metals Ltd. (“Peregrine”), a private Canadian incorporated company. Aldebaran currently owns a 60% interest in Peregrine. In August 2023, the Company informed Sibanye-Stillwater that it had met its commitments to complete the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in Peregrine from Sibanye-Stillwater (see Company news release dated August 14, 2023). The process of finalizing the additional acquisition is ongoing and an official announcement is expected in Q4 of this year. Upon finalizing the acquisition, Aldebaran will hold an 80% interest in Peregrine, with Sibanye-Stillwater holding the remaining 20%. Both Aldebaran and Sibanye-Stillwater will need to fund future work programs based on their equity interest in Peregrine.

**Transaction Details**

Aldebaran has entered into an Option to Joint Venture Agreement with Nuton, whereby Nuton has the exclusive right to acquire a 20% interest in Peregrine in exchange for the following payments:

* US$10 Million upon signing (“ **Signing Payment** ”)
* US$20 Million upon delivery of an updated mineral resource estimate (“ **MRE Payment** ”)
   * Mineral resource estimate expected to be completed in November 2024
* US$30 Million upon delivery of a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“ **PEA Payment** ”)
   * PEA expected to be completed in Q2-2025
* US$190 Million upon delivery of a Pre-Feasibility Study (“ **PFS Payment** ”)
   * PFS expected to be completed in 2026

The payments by Nuton will be made as follows: 90% will be paid directly to Peregrine and 10% will be paid directly to Aldebaran, as directed by Peregrine. The payments made to Peregrine will be utilized to fund Aldebaran’s portion of ongoing and future work programs at Altar.

Upon completion of the PFS Payment, Nuton will acquire a 20% interest in Peregrine and have a 20% indirect interest in the Altar project. Altar would then be owned as follows: Aldebaran 60%, Sibanye-Stillwater 20%, and Nuton 20%, with Aldebaran operating the project.

If Nuton elects not to proceed after the issuance of the MRE, PEA or PFS, the Option Agreement will be terminated, Aldebaran will retain its 80% interest in the project, and Aldebaran and Peregrine will retain any cash payments made prior to the termination unless there is an uncured material breach of the agreement by Aldebaran or Peregrine.

Nuton and Aldebaran have agreed to a work program for the 2024/2025 field season to ensure that Nuton’s proprietary sulphide leaching technology can be evaluated in both the PEA and PFS. This work program involves drilling several new “twin-holes 1 ” of existing drill holes to acquire large-diameter PQ-sized drill core to be utilized in Nuton’s Phase 2 testing program (see below for details). The cost of this drill program will be paid from Nuton’s US$10 Million Signing Payment. If the drill program exceeds US$5 Million, as mutually agreed, Nuton will advance those costs from the PEA Payment. All costs associated with the actual testing of the Altar drill core with the Nuton technologies will be borne by Nuton. The Phase 1 program is ongoing (see below for details).

Aldebaran will also conduct additional work programs at Altar during the 2024-25 field season to advance the PEA and PFS and potentially explore other areas of interest on the Altar property.

As part of the agreement, Nuton will have exclusivity over any novel, trade secret or patented copper heap-leach related technology to be tested or deployed at the Altar project for a period of two years.

**Phase 1 Nuton Program**

Ten (10) samples, totaling approximately 2,100 kg, were shipped to Nuton earlier in 2024. All samples were taken from previously drilled, well preserved, PQ-sized whole core stored in the Company’s San Juan warehouse. The samples were shipped to SGS laboratories in Santiago, Chile for further sample preparation according to Nuton specifications and protocols. The prepared materials were then shipped from Chile to Denver, Colorado, and placed into several columns with a height of 1 m, with each column under different controlled Nuton operational conditions. Results from Phase 1 are expected in Q2-2025 and will be utilized in the PEA.

**Phase 2 Nuton Program**

Aldebaran will complete large diameter PQ-sized drilling this coming field season to provide Nuton with material to be placed into full-height, 10 m columns. The 10 m height columns are designed to simulate a typical 10 metre “lift” height in an operational heap-leach pad. The scale-up from 1 m to 10 m height columns will provide valuable data that will be utilized in the Nuton case in the Altar PFS. It is anticipated that the final results will be ready approximately two years after the delivery of the rock material. Nuton has informed Aldebaran that interim results, which will be available in 2026, should be representative and can be utilized in the PFS.

**The Altar Project**

The Altar copper-gold project hosts a cluster of porphyry deposits in San Juan, Argentina, which Aldebaran is expanding through exploration to deliver to the rising copper market. The 2021 pit-constrained resource estimate showed 11.4B lb Cu and 3.4Moz Au in the Measured and Indicated categories, plus 1.7B lb Cu and 0.4Moz Au Inferred. Since the last resource update, the Company has completed more than 63,000 m of drilling and discovered an additional porphyry centre called Altar United. The Company is completing an updated resource estimate, which will be completed in November of 2024. The Company has engaged SRK Consulting as Lead to complete a PEA in Q2-2025 and a PFS in 2026, with Knight Piesold as a sub-contractor.

**About Aldebaran Resources Inc.**

Aldebaran is a mineral exploration company that was spun out of Regulus Resources Inc. in 2018 and has the same core management team. Aldebaran holds a 60% interest in the Altar copper-gold project in San Juan Province, Argentina and can earn an additional 20% interest in the project by completing a further $25 million in expenditures at Altar over the next three years. The Altar project hosts multiple porphyry copper-gold deposits with potential for additional discoveries. Altar forms part of a cluster of world-class porphyry copper deposits which includes Los Pelambres (Antofagasta Minerals), El Pachón (Glencore), and Los Azules (McEwen Copper). In March 2021 the Company announced an updated mineral resource estimate for Altar, prepared by Independent Mining Consultants Inc. and based on the drilling completed up to and including 2020 (independent technical report prepared by Independent Mining Consultants Inc., Tucson, Arizona, titled “ *Technical Report, Estimated Mineral Resources, Altar Project, San Juan Province, Argentina”* , dated March 22, 2021 - see news release dated March 22, 2021).

**About Nuton**

Nuton is an innovative venture that aims to help grow Rio Tinto’s copper business. At the core of Nuton is a portfolio of proprietary copper leaching related technologies and capability – a product of almost 30 years of research and development. Nuton offers the potential to economically unlock copper from primary sulfide resources through leaching, achieving market-leading recovery rates and contributing to an increase in copper production at new and ongoing operations-. One of the key differentiators of Nuton is the ambition to produce the world’s lowest footprint copper while having at least one Positive Impact at each of our deployment sites, across our five pillars: water, energy, land, materials and society.

**Sampling and Analytical Procedures**

Altar follows systematic and rigorous sampling and analytical protocols which meet and exceed industry standards.

722,18xab17,RIO TINTO PLC (RIO),FinTecGeek,/r/ValueInvesting/comments/18xab17/rio_tinto_plc_rio/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/18xab17/rio_tinto_plc_rio/,26,16,1704255804.0,"**Quick Facts**

Rio Tinto PLC is a London-HQ mining and metals conglomerate with exposure to iron ore, aluminum, copper, diamonds and an unsubstantial business related to other rare-Earth exploration and mining.

**Investment Thesis**

Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) continues to cut costs and divest less-profitable segments of business in order to strengthen both P&amp;L and balance sheet metrics, with prior moves to this end reflecting positively in the most recent financial statements. While growth is not the story here (I am expecting EPS to decline modestly in the next full-year results) the company is returning value to shareholders through a 5.5% dividend yield that looks well-covered by earnings. Despite historical outperformance of their benchmark index (EFA) they have lagged the benchmark in 2023. As an added bonus, the company reports in domestic currency (USD).

**Fundamentals**

RIO reported falling debt/equity ratios over the past three years, showing a declining trend in reliance on debt, with the current ratio just below 25% looking very healthy vs comps. Operating margins and net margins are also notably high, reflecting pricing power combined with a sustainable advantage vs peers. Net margin for 2022 was just above 22%, rising from just under 22% in 2020. ROA and ROE are both look healthy and are trending in the right direction over the trailing three years. Despite a high dividend yield, the payout ratio is sitting around 40% in the most recent year, signaling room for dividend growth or special dividends to shareholders.

**Balance Sheet Review**

The company has a stellar balance sheet with substantial cash reserves, a healthy delta between assets and liabilities and an interest coverage ratio above 10x. Further, Moody's concurs with my analysis in maintaining an A2/stable credit outlook for the firm. While I wasn't able to rely on a recent rating update from S&amp;P, the most recent issued was A/stable. Fitch is silent on RIO.

**Valuation**

At 10x forward-earnings, the company appears undervalued with a notable margin of safety vs typical market multiples. It isn't rock-bottom cheap, but with such solid margins and a squeaky-clean balance sheet, I don't think a lower multiple looks likely. Rather, the company has historically outperformed peers with ""in-line"" multiples, meaning the current deviation offers a rare chance to enter below the stock's normal price/cash flow range. Historically, the price/cash flow range has been 9.0/4.1, but the most recent year has seen a more attractive 6.3/3.7 range. Over a considerable time-horizon, the market has shown us the company deserves a premium given at least a narrow sustainable advantage vs peers, and right now, that sustainable advantage looks to be trading at a $0 premium vs comps without one.

**Technical**

Looking at the price activity on the charts, I am seeing a new bullish pattern developing where higher highs are correcting back to lows that are higher than a previous low. This could be seen as a stubborn double-bottom, meaning buying is overtaking selling in the short-term.

**Risks/Uncertainties**

Historically, investors have proven somewhat impatient in terms of ""waiting out an earnings storm"" meaning that while I expect only a modest reduction in earnings and then a return to earnings growth in perpetuity thereafter, investors may still dump the stock who have already held the stock for many years and have sizable gains. This could derail a developing bullish cycle and create more downside than I anticipated. Additionally, commodities pricing could decline steeply, presenting a short-term challenge that could force the firm to cut back the dividend yield, which typically will create a moderate to heavy downward pressure for the stock's price.

**Conclusion**

RIO does not really fit cleanly into a pure value strategy, however if you agree with the market that there are things going on at RIO over the past many years that warrant a premium, I think you can get excited about today's multiples and potentially hold this stock for a very long time (with buying activity seeing an end likely in the intermediate term of course). Cheers!

I am in no way associated to RVSN and like many of you have only recently discovered them via a post from BestPhone here on Reddit (massive thanks mate….ive done well so far and hopeful about the future on this one!)  

Being someone who is highly suspicious, particularly of something which seems ¨hyped¨ or ¨too good to be true¨ i have been trying to conduct a through assessment of the company, its associations, partners, board members and any red flags in terms of this being a ¨pump and dump¨

I currently hold just over 4000 shares. Given the big dip across the market, particularly small caps, it is natural to feel a bit nervous/stupid/unsure if you are being played……..so with the market being closed today i wanted to try and make sure that i am not 

Essentially, from what i can find out - if we are, then we are in very good company including Nvidia, UBS, the EU and lots more, all of whom will have conducted due diligence into the company, its key members, its finances and its products…... Which leads me to conclude we are probably not! 

I share my findings here to help you make your own decision about the company 

Firstly (spoiler alert) i am even more of a fan of this company having done this exercise….i honestly tried to find things to be worried about but the only tiny concern i can find is one board members association to SciSpark which i see as a bit of a dodgy pump and dump tbh….but its a very loose association based on one board members (OZ Adler) and given they are both Israeli companies i dont think it means much. Every other aspect seem super legit 

So i will start by recapping some very good news for RVSN since Dec 4th. All of these articles can be looked at online via various sources including RVSN website and Reuters news . 


✅ 1 trading day away from Nasdaq compliance (needs to close above 1 on Monday) and looking like it should make that no problem (currently at 1.70)
 
✅ Signs binding agreement with major distributor in India + up font payment

✅ Receives regulatory approval in Israel

✅ Receives new order (and seemingly opens a new market) in Central America 
✅ Joins MXV to guide rail safety and investment in N. America

✅ Launches new SaaS product 

All since Dec 4th 2024!

Final Assessment (By the AI) 
Rail Vision Ltd. demonstrates a strong foundation of innovative products, strategic partnerships, and global market presence. Its ability to scale, secure long-term contracts, and maintain financial stability will determine its success in the competitive railway safety technology market. While challenges exist, the company’s alignment with industry trends and its extensive network of partnerships position it well for sustainable growth in the short to mid-term.
My assessment 

Unless RVSN have managed to ¨pull the woll¨over the eyes of the EU, MXV, NVIDIA, UBS, the Israeli government, Rio Tinto, Knorr-Bremse and lots more very reputable, globally respected organisations in a scam worthy of Oceans 11, RVSN seem to be a legit company with an experienced board of Directors and a number of very important partnerships to start commercialising cutting edge, patented AI safety products 

In light of that, for me, these are the decisions to be made when considering RVSN as an investment opportunity 

Will AI, Machine learning and big data play a part in transport safety in years to come 

Does the company have unique and cutting edge technology to bring to market 

Is there a sizable market (TAM) and need for the products 

Does the company have the approvals, partners and distribution network to start to commercialise 


Personally, particularly after this exercise in fact finding, i believe the answer to all the above to be a resounding YES 

Make your own decisions of course and none of the above is intended to influence that decision but hopefully it saves you some time and collects some valuable insights together to help us invest sensibly and safely in a small cap, late stage start up",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:29.345239,2025-01-12T01:19:17,RT,2025

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / November 7, 2023 / Regulus Resources Inc. (""Regulus""** or the **""Company"") (TSXV:REG)(OTCQX:RGLSF)** is pleased to announce that it has delivered samples to Nuton LLC (""Nuton""), a Rio Tinto venture, to begin the phase two metallurgical program utilizing Nuton's proprietary primary sulphide leaching technologies. The phase one metallurgical program (See July 6, 2023 press release) determined that mineralization from AntaKori was amenable to Nuton's sulphide leaching technologies, while the phase two program is designed to expand on the results from phase one and refine the understanding regarding metallurgical recoveries for various styles of mineralization.

**Sample Selection, Preparation, and Methodology**

Samples were selected and composited from each of the main mineralization styles at the AntaKori project: high sulphidation, skarn and porphyry. A total of eight composite samples were taken totaling 1,448.7 kg (see Table 1 for sample details and Figures 1 and 2 for sample locations). All samples were taken from Regulus drill hole core stored in the Company's Cajamarca warehouse. The samples were shipped to SGS laboratories in Lima Peru for further sample preparation according to Nuton specifications and protocols, under the supervision of Transmin Metallurgical Consultants S.A.C. Once the samples have been prepared in SGS Lima, a small representative sample split will be sent to Nuton for detailed chemical and mineralogical analyses of each of the composite samples before commencement of the main phase two column test work. Chemical and mineralogical data will be used to predict column test results.

The remaining prepared samples will be shipped from SGS Lima to Nuton's test facilities for phase two test work, which will entail samples being placed in columns with a height of 1 m, each under different controlled Nuton operating conditions. The columns will be continuously monitored and it is expected that once samples are placed into columns, the full results will be available approximately one year later.

MELBOURNE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rio Tinto has entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Platina Scandium Project, a high-grade scandium resource in New South Wales, from Platina Resources Limited (ASX: PGM) for $14 million.

The project, near Condobolin in central New South Wales, comprises a long life, high-grade scalable resource that could produce up to 40 tonnes per annum of scandium oxide, for an estimated period of 30 years.

Rio Tinto currently produces scandium oxide from titanium dioxide production waste streams at Sorel-Tracy in Quebec. Once operational, the Platina Scandium Project would enable Rio Tinto to more than double its annual scandium production.

This acquisition aligns with Rio Tinto’s strategic goal to grow in materials essential for the low-carbon transition.

Scandium is a rare, versatile and useful mineral for the green economy and energy transition. It is considered a critical mineral by the United States, Canada, Australia and many other countries.

Scandium is one of the most effective elements able to strengthen aluminium, while also offering improved flexibility and resistance to heat and corrosion. As a result, it is used to produce high-performance aluminium alloys for applications that need to be light, strong and heat resistant, including in aerospace, automotive, heat exchangers, sporting goods, 3D printing and energy transmission applications.

Scandium oxide is also used to improve the performance of solid oxide fuel cells used as a green power source for buildings, medical facilities and data processing centres, as well as in niche products such as lasers and lighting.

# Rio Tinto Minerals Chief Executive Sinead Kaufman said “This acquisition supports our commitment to critical minerals and finding better ways to provide materials the world needs.

# “It will enable us to further develop and grow with the global scandium market, complementing our existing scandium production in Quebec, where we have the expertise, technology and capacity to produce pure, highly reliable scandium through sustainable methods.”

# With its world-class aluminium business, Rio Tinto is also well positioned to produce more high-performance aluminium-scandium alloys to meet global customers’ needs.

[https:\/\/calchamberalert.com\/2018\/10\/19\/administration-announces-intent-to-open-trade-talks-with-eu-uk-japan\/](https://preview.redd.it/7pmnwzcx3mwa1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3acd55a9c738483019050ee36bd2ba55e2b13d88)

The Biden administration’s [**2022 National Security Strategy**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf) (NSS) says China is “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge” and “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it.” Two key parts of the U.S. strategy towards China outlined in the NSS are: investing in domestic American competitiveness, innovation, resilience, and democracy; and working closely with allies and partners. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 aims to address American competitiveness. However, an unintended consequence of the IRA has been the [**alienation**](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/business/green-subsides-inflation-reduction-act-europe/index.html) of many U.S. allies and partners. The European Union (EU), Japan, South Korea, India, and the United Kingdom (UK) have all spoken out against the IRA, claiming it is [**protectionist**](https://time.com/6247230/inflation-reduction-act-global-response-climate-trade-protectionsim/), violates World Trade Organization (WTO) [**rules**](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/row-over-ev-subsidy-rules-overshadows-skorean-presidents-first-us-visit-2022-09-19/), and will harm their countries’ domestic industries and [**competitiveness**](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-and-germany-find-ground-on-a-common-concern-u-s-protectionism/). A requirement of the IRA that is receiving particularly harsh criticism is the [**requirement**](https://www.reuters.com/business/skorea-seeks-cooperation-with-eu-over-us-inflation-reduction-act-2022-08-25/) that 40% of the critical minerals in an electric vehicle (EV) battery must come from the United States or a U.S. free trade partner for the EV to receive a subsidy. Neither the EU, UK, Japan, nor India has a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States. At a time when the United States is pushing allies to reduce their reliance on China, especially for critical minerals, such conflict is counterproductive. The critical minerals agreement [**signed**](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/united-states-and-japan-sign-critical-minerals-agreement) with Japan in March 2023 and equivalent agreements under [**negotiations**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/economy/us-europe-climate.html) with the EU and the UK are a step in the right direction. These critical minerals agreements will help mend fences with key allies while driving cooperation on critical minerals supply chains that are crucial to modern technology and have become a significant area of competition between China and the United States.

**Angry Allies and Competition with China**

The IRA contains provisions [**regarding**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) federal spending to reduce carbon emissions, lower healthcare costs, fund the Internal Revenue Service, and improve taxpayer compliance. The IRA [**aims**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) to increase domestic manufacturing, incentivize procuring critical supplies domestically or from countries the United States has an FTA with, and spur research and development and commercialization of cutting-edge technologies. While the IRA has been praised [**domestically**](https://navigatorresearch.org/the-public-broadly-supports-the-inflation-reduction-act/) and [**internationally**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/why-us-inflation-reduction-act-has-rattled-europe-2023-02-01/) as an important piece of climate legislation, countries have taken issue with certain requirements that they claim discriminate against their companies. [**Requirements**](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-new-us-electric-vehicle-tax-plan-heres-why/) that final-stage EV assembly must be in North America, at least 40% of the critical minerals in an EV battery must come from the United States or a country the United States has an FTA with, and at least 50% of the battery must have North American content have drawn much of the scorn from American allies. The European Commission warns that the IRA risks starting a global[ **subsidy race**](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/11/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-new-us-electric-vehicle-tax-plan-heres-why/), with countries instituting higher and higher subsidies to keep green technology manufacturing in their country. The[ **EU**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/why-us-inflation-reduction-act-has-rattled-europe-2023-02-01/) and[ **South Korea**](https://www.reuters.com/business/skorea-seeks-cooperation-with-eu-over-us-inflation-reduction-act-2022-08-25/) also claim the IRA violates WTO non-discrimination rules giving preference to products produced in the United States. The [**EU**](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-and-germany-find-ground-on-a-common-concern-u-s-protectionism/) and [**India**](https://www.carbonbrief.org/media-reaction-us-inflation-reduction-act-and-the-global-clean-energy-arms-race/) are already working on legislative responses to provide similar support for their industries. Additionally, EU policymakers are considering retaliatory [**tariffs**](https://www.politico.eu/article/trade-war-europe-us-tech/). 

Disputes with allies and partners are the last thing the United States needs at a time when it is trying to convince these same countries that they need to reduce their economic reliance on China. Europe has been [**reluctant to decrease its economic ties to China**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/08/us-europe-china-00086204). However, there are signs Europe could be changing its position. For example, Germany is [**reviewing**](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/08/1154315168/germany-china-huawei-restrictions) its use of equipment from China’s Huawei and ZTE in Germany’s 5G networks, and the UK is giving telecommunications companies until December 2023 to [**remove Huawei equipment**](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/uk-gives-telco-firms-more-time-to-remove-huawei-5g-equipment.html) from their networks. The United States should be leveraging Europe’s shifting policies to further America’s [**friend-shoring**](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/19/us-treasury-secretary-on-supply-chain-resilience-use-friend-shoring.html) agenda, not starting subsidy or trade wars with Europe. The same goes for Japan, which recently joined the United States and the Netherlands in [**instituting crucial export controls**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/japan-restrict-chipmaking-equipment-exports-aligning-it-with-us-china-curbs-2023-03-31/) on certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment, targeting China. Japan and the Netherlands are the only countries besides the United States who produce this equipment. If Japan and the Netherlands had not joined the United States in instituting the export controls, U.S. companies would have been harmed without having much of an impact on China’s semiconductor industry. 

**Steps in the Right Direction**

The United States is taking steps to right its wrongs. In March 2023, the United States [**signed**](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/march/united-states-and-japan-sign-critical-minerals-agreement) a critical minerals agreement with Japan that bans export duties on critical minerals and calls for cooperation in addressing “non-market policies and practices of other countries affecting trade in critical minerals,” sharing best practices on reviewing investments in the critical minerals sector by foreign entities, reducing the environmental impact of critical mineral extraction, and promoting labor rights for workers in the critical minerals supply chains. In addition to enhancing cooperation on critical mineral supply chains, the critical minerals agreement is seen as a [**workaround**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/business/economy/us-japan-battery-minerals-deal.html) to the requirement that at least 40% of the critical minerals in an EV battery come from the United States or a U.S. free trade partner. The agreement is not an FTA in the typical sense where tariffs are reduced. However, U.S. law [**does not define**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/manchin-electric-vehicles-tax-credits-00089700) “free trade agreement.” The [**latest rules guidance**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/manchin-electric-vehicles-tax-credits-00089700) from the U.S. Treasury Department regarding the IRA EV tax credits says the Treasury will determine which countries the United States has an FTA with, and that its interpretation of FTAs could include critical minerals agreements. The United States is in the process of negotiating similar agreements with the [**EU**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/washington-brussels-pushback-patch-trade-rift-00089941) and the [**UK**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/economy/us-europe-climate.html).

The value of these critical minerals agreements goes beyond being a mechanism to help make EVs produced in these countries eligible for EV tax credits under the IRA. Critical minerals have been identified as essential to [**modern technologies**](https://www.energy.gov/eere/ammto/critical-minerals-and-materials#:~:text=Lithium%2C%20cobalt%2C%20and%20high%2D,and%20germanium%20used%20in%20semiconductors.) such as semiconductors, vehicles, and clean energy technologies, among others. China is a leading [**producer**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127203/critical-minerals-production-share-by-majority-producing-countries-global/#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20largest%20producer,percent%20of%20tungsten%20in%202022.) and [**refiner**](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210311_Nakano_Critical_Minerals.pdf?VersionId=DR03x5jIrwLnNjmPDD3SZjEkGEZFEcgt) of many critical minerals. The United States and its allies are concerned about their dependency on China for critical minerals and are striving to [**build alternative supply chains**](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/LTRC_ChinaSupplyChain.pdf). Critical minerals agreements like the one signed with Japan can help further this goal. Banning export duties on critical minerals makes it cheaper for critical minerals to move between Japan and the United States. Additionally, while China is not called out by name, the provision regarding the scrutiny of investments in the critical minerals sector by foreign entities will help Japan and the United States identify when Chinese companies try to purchase stakes in parts of the critical minerals supply chains in their respective countries. China has a history of investing in key parts of the critical minerals supply chains in other countries. For example, China does not have large reserves of cobalt, but Chinese enterprises have [**invested**](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210311_Nakano_Critical_Minerals.pdf?VersionId=DR03x5jIrwLnNjmPDD3SZjEkGEZFEcgt) in cobalt mines and smelting projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is home to around half of the world’s cobalt reserves. By identifying when Chinese companies attempt to invest in parts of the critical minerals supply chain within their countries, the [**United States**](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-happens-when-foreign-investment-becomes-security-risk) and [**Japan**](https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/FTA.pdf) can use their respective statutory authorities to prevent such investment if they deem it a national security risk. Other provisions of the agreement, such as addressing non-market policies of other countries and promoting labor rights for workers, would also apply to China, which has been accused of [**non-market policies**](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-rare-earths/) and [**forced labor in mining**](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/business/economy/forced-labor-china-supply-chain.html). Signing critical minerals agreements with the EU and UK would expand the number of U.S. allies and partners working together to rework the critical minerals supply chain.

**Congress Not on Board**

There are risks involving how the Biden administration has gone about negotiating critical minerals agreements. The Biden administration’s decision to negotiate the agreements as executive agreements, which do not require congressional approval, has drawn backlash from Congressmembers of both parties. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden [**decried**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/business/economy/us-japan-battery-minerals-deal.html) the administration’s “go-it-alone trade policy” while Senator Joe Manchin has [**threatened to go to court**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/30/biden-tax-breaks-credits-electric-cars-manchin-trade-00089574) over the Treasury’s interpretation of the EV tax credit. Meanwhile, Republican Representative Adrian Smith [**called**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/washington-brussels-pushback-patch-trade-rift-00089941) the critical minerals agreement with Japan “unacceptable and unconstitutional.” Congressional pushback in the United States has caused[ **concerns among EU members**](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/31/washington-brussels-pushback-patch-trade-rift-00089941) regarding the future of the proposed critical minerals agreement between the United States and the EU. Additionally, the EU has its concerns over the final form of the agreement (i.e., a free trade agreement versus a non-binding instrument) and the appropriate approval process within the EU (i.e., approval from the European Commission versus approval from each member state). These challenges are holding up the U.S.-EU critical minerals agreement negotiations.

Constitutional questions cannot be ignored. While partisanship may make it difficult to pass the critical minerals agreements, the Biden administration should seek congressional approval. Congressional approval would prevent a legal confrontation between the executive and legislative branches. Congressional approval would also make the agreement harder to undo by future administrations, as legislation requires another piece of legislation to undo while an executive agreement can be withdrawn by the president. 

**An Opportunity for Expansion**

Whatever legal form they take, critical minerals agreements with Japan, the EU, and the UK are important. The United States cannot win the competition with China on its own. To be successful, the United States must leverage its allies and partners. These critical minerals agreements can play a small, but important, part by both pacifying some concerns expressed by U.S. allies and furthering alternative supply chains for critical minerals. With this in mind, the United States would be wise to expand negotiations to include other countries. India is another country without an FTA with the United States. While India does not currently have large-scale mining for critical minerals relevant to battery production, it does have [**reserves**](http://www.compareyourcountry.org/trade-in-raw-materials/en/3/LITHI/all/default) of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite, all of which are important for EV batteries. Beyond critical minerals used to make EV batteries, India also has the [**fifth largest reserves**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277268/rare-earth-reserves-by-country/) of rare earth elements, a subset of critical minerals that are key to producing electronics and semiconductors, among other high-tech goods. The United States and its international partners stand to benefit significantly from a critical minerals agreement with India. 

**Competing with China**

The competition between the United States and China may occur across the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological domains, but [**geoeconomics**](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE310.html) is the current driver of the competition. Critical minerals and clean energy are two areas where this competition is playing out. China[ **dominates**](https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/210311_Nakano_Critical_Minerals.pdf?VersionId=DR03x5jIrwLnNjmPDD3SZjEkGEZFEcgt) the critical minerals supply chains, the production of solar panels, and the production of components used in wind turbines. This dominance gives China leverage over resources that are required for high-tech goods and clean energy technology that is vital to reducing carbon emissions.

As the United States aims to create alternative supply chains that do not rely on China, partnerships with allies and partners will be vital. Critical minerals agreements with Japan, the EU, the UK, and India are a good starting point. Such agreements will build on critical minerals supply chain efforts already underway among the United States and its allies. In 2021, during a meeting of the Quad, a security dialogue between the United States, India, Japan, and Australia,[ **Australia agreed**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/quad-nations-to-cooperate-on-rare-earths-chips-and-key-tech-supply-chains) to deeper cooperation with the United States, India, and Japan on the supply, manufacturing, and processing of rare earth elements. Additionally, in June 2022, the United States Department of Defense[ **signed a contract**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/australias-lynas-secures-120-mln-pentagon-contract-us-rare-earths-facility-2022-06-14/) with Australian rare-earth element processor Lynas Rare Earths to build a rare earths separation facility, and in February 2023, Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation and the United States’ MP Materials[ **signed an agreement**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230221005229/en/) to collaborate on the supply of rare earth elements.

Critical minerals agreements do not solve all the concerns expressed by U.S. allies and partners. Nor will these agreements alone create the alternative supply chains the United States and its allies are striving to develop. However, such agreements can help mend relations with key allies and demonstrate that the United States understands their objections and is willing to work with them to resolve their concerns where possible. At the same time, these agreements can serve as a baseline for future cooperation on critical minerals and clean energy technology.

https://preview.redd.it/cuu0xt557mwa1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d5d35c021636fe87ebdfc0d009b1ccf7eb3bd06

***The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is proposing that all public companies report their carbon emissions.***

***In general, it will increase the reporting transparency of public corporations. It will help investors know more about how climate risks affect their investments.***

What to know about the new rule?

***One major mandate is that companies disclose both their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The same goes for their Scope 3 emissions, if “material”.***

***Some firms have announced their carbon footprint reduction pledges already. The SEC will mandate them to share how they would achieve such commitments. If corporations set their own carbon price, the SEC will demand them to report about it.***

***Climate activists are vigilant on*** [***carbon offsets strategy***](https://carboncredits.com/sec-pressured-to-include-carbon-credits-in-disclosure/) ***for reducing carbon emissions.***

How would this impact public companies?

***Most companies are already disclosing their carbon emissions in their annual sustainability reports. But significant discrepancies remain.***

***The former SEC chair Schapiro noted that there are still many big companies that won’t do it unless it’s mandatory. The present SEC chair said that both companies and investors would value the new law.***

***Companies will need help from climate tech experts for their climate risk reports. This is good news for carbon accounting due to increased carbon emissions reporting.***

How important is the disclosed information?

***According to SEC, it is the investors that pushed them to draft the rule. They demand better and more transparent climate risk information disclosure. This is because climate change disasters impact the environment.***

***Likewise, climate risks are also becoming essential for investors to make informed decisions. The information will also show which companies commit to reducing their carbon footprint. The public and investors can put pressure on businesses that are true to their words, not actions.***

***This rule will make the SEC the leading enforcer of climate-related financial disclosures. The draft proposal will be more likely finalized before this year ends.***

*Not for Distribution to U.S. Newswire Services or Dissemination in the United States*

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 22, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **Regulus Resources Inc. (""Regulus""** or the **""Company"", TSX-V: REG, OTCQX: RGLSF)** is pleased to announce a US$15,000,000 (approx. C$20,460,153\*) non-brokered private placement (the “Private Placement”), by Nuton, a Rio Tinto Venture (“Nuton”).

**Highlights**

* Regulus is completing a Private Placement of US$15,000,000 (approx. C$20,460,153\*) at a subscription price of C$1.02 per common share
* Nuton will subscribe for 20,058,974 common shares (the “Nuton Subscription”)
* Upon closing, Nuton will own an approximate 16.5% interest in Regulus
* Regulus and Nuton will jointly undertake copper sulphide leach testing utilizing Nuton’s copper sulphide leach technologies with samples from AntaKori
* The Nuton™ technologies have the potential to process arsenic-bearing copper sulphides with less impact on the environment and water resources than traditional concentrator processing
* The Private Placement will put Regulus in a very strong cash position
* Adding Rio Tinto as a strategic partner will enhance Regulus’ ability to optimize the value of the existing resources at AntaKori and explore various options with the neighbouring Tantahuatay mine to optimize the combined Tantahuatay-AntaKori copper gold sulphide deposit (TantaKori).

**John Black, Chief Executive Officer of Regulus, commented as follows:**

“ *We are delighted to welcome Rio Tinto as a strategic investor in the Company. The investment by Rio Tinto, one of the largest miners in the world, is another strong endorsement for the AntaKori project. Through Nuton, Rio Tinto has developed sulphide leach processing technologies that could allow for the processing of high arsenic ores without the need for additional on-site treatment or paying heavy penalties to a smelter. Utilizing the Nuton sulphide leach technologies could truly be a game-changer for the AntaKori deposit. The Private Placement will significantly bolster our financial position and enhance our ability to optimize the value of the existing resources in the project area.* ”

**Rio Tinto’s Chief Executive, Copper, Bold Baatar, commented as follows:**

“ *This agreement will allow us to evaluate the potential to commercially deploy Rio Tinto’s innovative Nuton technologies for copper leaching at Regulus’ AntaKori project. Our Nuton technologies have the capacity to increase copper production for Rio Tinto and our partners, with a lower carbon footprint and leading environmental performance. Unlocking value from high-arsenic copper sulphides is a particularly exciting prospect for Nuton.* ”

In connection with the Nuton Subscription, Regulus and Nuton will enter into a collaboration agreement wherein Nuton will be granted certain investor rights, including allowing Nuton to maintain its equity interest in Regulus if it maintains said interest above 10%. Additionally, Nuton shall be allowed to nominate a director to the board of directors of the Company. The Company and Nuton have agreed to form a joint advisory committee to share expertise, exploration concepts and discuss development opportunities at AntaKori. The Company has granted exclusivity to Nuton in the area of novel, patented or trade secret leaching technologies, for a period of one year after the delivery of metallurgical samples from AntaKori to Nuton for testing. For a one-year period, Nuton has agreed to not sell any share of Regulus, acquire greater than a 19.9% interest in the Company and vote its common shares in favour of each director nominated by the Company.

Closing of the Private Placement is expected to occur in January 2023 and is subject to various conditions, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. No finder’s fee or commissions are payable in connection with the Private Placement.

**McEwen Copper is well-funded to advance its Los Azules Project, located in the mining friendly province of San Juan, Argentina. The next milestones are the upcoming drilling season from October 2022 to June 2023, the completion of an updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA) in early Q1 2023, and the planned IPO of McEwen Copper in H1 2023.**

In connection with the Offering, McEwen Copper entered into a collaboration agreement with Nuton (the ""Nuton Collaboration Agreement”) to advance our understanding of the potential application of heap leach technology at Los Azules, including the testing of **Nuton® Technologies** for compatibility with Los Azules copper mineralization. Leaching has many potential economic and environmental benefits over a conventional milling scenario, including lower water and energy consumption, no large tailings storage facility or dam, and typically lower capital and operating costs.

McEwen Copper Chief Executive Rob McEwen said: ***“Los Azules is among the largest undeveloped copper assets in the world. We recognize the potential opportunity of using Nuton Technologies to produce copper in greater amounts, more rapidly, and with less impact on the environment and water resources. I trust that our relationship with Nuton and Rio Tinto will accelerate the process of realizing the enormous potential of Los Azules.”***

Rio Tinto Chief Executive Copper Bold Baatar said: ***“This agreement will allow us to evaluate the potential to commercially deploy Rio Tinto’s innovative Nuton Technologies for copper leaching in McEwen Copper’s planned development of Los Azules. Our Nuton Technologies have the capacity to unlock increased copper production for Rio Tinto and our partners, with a low carbon footprint and leading environmental performance.”***

The principal terms of the Nuton Collaboration Agreement include:

* **Nuton** **will invest $25 million in McEwen Copper** , acquiring 2.5 million common shares at $10.00 per common share, for post-closing ownership of 9.73%.
* **McEwen Copper and Nuton** **will jointly undertake copper leach testing using Nuton** **Technologies** with samples from Los Azules. McEwen Copper has agreed to grant exclusivity to Nuton for one year in the area of novel, patented or trade secret leaching technology, while it will continue its independent test work and studies using conventional leach technologies.
* **Nuton will have the right to select one nominee who will be appointed as a director or observer to the Board of McEwen Copper**
* **McEwen Copper and its controlling shareholders will not complete a liquidity event (such as the planned IPO) until after March 31, 2023.**
* **McEwen Copper has agreed to limit related party transactions in certain situations** until the earlier of the planned IPO (or alternative liquidity event) or Nuton ceasing to hold 7.5% **.**
* **Customary standstill and lock-up agreement** between the Investor and its affiliates and McEwen Copper and its affiliates.
* Other customary representations and warranties.

Without a doubt 2021 has been the most pivotal year for the uranium industry in more than a decade. The markets, politicians and corporations appear to have recognised that without nuclear power being a part of the energy conversation, a sustainable, zero carbon emission future will be near impossible to achieve.

This recognition, coupled with multiple other factors including; major supply deficits, the exponential growth of the EV industry and its increasing power requirements and, more recently, the emergence of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT), has helped the spot uranium price hit near decade long highs. 

As a result we have seen massive gains across the uranium equities, particularly those on the ASX. But the best part is that the current cycle is still in its infancy. It is unlikely new production will come online during the next 12 months and further uranium price increases will be necessary for brownfield and almost all greenfield projects to commence.

To put how small the uranium market still is into perspective: The WHOLE global market is worth only about US$42 billion (to date). That is all the uranium equities all around the world, the ETFs and major funds are worth a combined $42billion. Now Glencore is just a single major coal producer and has a market cap of US$64.46 Billion !  Let that radiate for bit.

# ASX Uranium Performance - Chart Comparison

# Types of ASX Uranium Companies

The uranium companies can be divided into 3x Key Categories: **Miners** or near term producers, **mine developers** and **exploration** companies. There is also one uranium enrichment technology company on the ASX - Silex Systems (ASX: SLX) - but that is not included in the coverage.

**ASX Uranium Miners / Producers**

This covers the few ASX companies that have a uranium mine somewhere in the world that uranium can be produced from though may require some capital investment to restart. Currently ALL ASX dedicated uranium miners have their mines shut-in on care and maintenance while uranium prices are too low to sustain operation of the mine. The uranium miners will be the first to re-introduce supply to the uranium market when higher contract term prices are signed. Some of these miners, even though shut-in, have been purchasing physical lbs of uranium (like BOE to PEN) as a strategic stockpile investment and to also meet existing contract deliveries. There are also companies like BHP and Rio Tinto that have some uranium production, though this is not a primary asset, and for the likes of BHP uranium is a by-product from the copper Olympic Dam mine. These companies are not included in the coverage. Below are the main ASX uranium miners

* **Peninsular Energy** (ASX: PEN) ---- Lance Project ISR Mine in Wyoming.   Previous Producer. On care and maintenance.
* **Lotus Resources** (ASX: LOT) ------ Purchased the open-pit Kaylekera mine   in Malawi from Paladin in March 2020. On care and maintenance
* **Boss Energy** (ASX: BOE) ----- Purchased the Honeymoon ISR mine from   Uranium One in 2013. On care and maintenance
* **Paladin Energy** (ASX: PDN) ---- Retained the Langer Heinrich mine in   Namibia - developed in the last cycle. On care and maintenance

**ASX Uranium Mine Developers**

These companies are those that have proved up a significant uranium resource and have conducted a series of studies or pilot plants for a large mine development. The Uranium Mine developers include: 

* **Aura Energy** (ASX: AEE) ----Tiris Project in Mauritania
* **Bannerman Energy** (ASX: BMN) ---- Etango Project in Namibia
* **Deep Yellow** (ASX: DYL) ----- Tumas Project Namibia
* **Toro Energy** (ASX: TOE) ----- Wiluna Project - Western Australia
* **Vimy Resources** (ASX: VMY) ----- Mulga Rock Project - Western   Australia

**ASX Uranium Explorers**

Not necessarily dedicated to just uranium exploration as many exploration companies are in the search for other minerals such as gold, vanadium, battery metals and rare earths and will jump between what is hot at the time. This selection has some drilling or exploration committed to uranium exploration with at least 40-50% of the company and funding focused on the asset. 

* **GTI Resources** (ASX: GTR) Exploration in Utah and Wyoming (USA)
* **92 Energy** (ASX: 92E) Exploring Athabasca basin (Canada)
* **Elevate Uranium** (ASX: EL8) Largest tenements of exploration in Namibia
* **Alligator Energy** (ASX: AGE) Exploration tenements in SA and NT  (Aus) 

There are a  number of additional “uranium exploration companies” that don’t meet the criteria for worthwhile assessment.

# ASX Uranium Companies Brief and Update

# Lotus Resources (LOT)

**Brief History**

Lotus purchased the Kaylekera mine (Malawi) from Paladin in March 2020 along with the surrounding exploration leases and infrastructure. Kaylekera previously produced 11Million lbs under Paladin operation from 2009-2014.

**Key Activities Last 6-12months**

* Ore Sorting Trials - Results of increasing grades by up to 100% with higher recoveries &gt;92%  (i.e. they autonomously sift through the ore to dispose of excess waste material before it goes through the mine plant).
* Increased ownership in Kaylekera from 65% to 85% (remainder 15% with Malawi Government)
* Near mine exploration - very under-explored with high upside potential
* 5,000m RC Exploration drill program -  exploring for uranium AND rare earths
   * 4,000m focused on Uranium and 1,000m focused on RE - results due late 2021
* Acquired tenement with proven 6M lb in ground resource for $0.004/lb (total $25k)
* Cash of $29.1million with many options yet to be converted

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* Exploration Drilling results due late 2021 --&gt; increase uranium resource size
* Rare earth discovery 
* Definitive Feasibility study (DFS)  due out in June/July 2022
* Looking to go into contract negotiations in  2022
   * “Plan is to lock in multiple contracts in a layered approach with some produced lbs kept to the side for sale into spot market to maximise capital value”

**Timeframe to production**

* DFS +6months to negotiate capital and on contracts → end of 2022 for FID
* Refurbishment of plant to take 12-15months to complete → be producing uranium by Q1 2024

[Lotus Resources Pros vs Cons](https://preview.redd.it/mwq0q5fzxiy71.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e0763fd77883ae43d942da53410f1bdeec22fd0)

# Boss Energy (BOE)

**Brief History**

Boss Energy (formerly Boss Resources) purchased the HoneyMoon mine and plant in central South Australia from US company Uranium One in December 2015. BOE has since increased the JORC resource size from 16.6Mlbs to 71.6Mlbs (\~331% increase), undertaken a number of studies and plant optimisation improvements and purchased 1.25 Mlbs of U3O8 as strategic stockpile.

**Key Activities Last 6-12months**

* Feasibility Study (FS) - Released in January 2020
* Completion of Enhanced Feasibility Study (EFS)  - Released in June 2021
   * Plans to remove the existing SX plant and replaced it with IX capacity to increase the production profile to 2.45Mlb/annum over a 10+ year mine life and reduce operating costs to achieve industry benchmark goals for low-cost producers of AISC of US$25/lb and cash costs lower than US$20/lb. 
* Completion of two significant capital raisings: first for $15 million(@ $0.067/share Oct 2020) and an additional $60 million (@ $0.14/ share) during March 2021.
* Purchase and acquisition of 1.25 Million lbs of physical U3O8 @ US$30.15/lb - March 2021
   * Total cost of US$37.68M (A$49.69M) . This inventory is now valued at US$53.75M (A$73.83M) at spot price of US$43.00/lb. A$24mill book return on investment.
* Accelerated development of the exploration program which has already seen a JORC increase from 16.6Mlbs to 71.6Mlbs.

“In addition to the substantial profit we stand to make on this investment, the stockpile de-risks our start-up process and therefore strengthens our hand in negotiations with potential customers.” - Duncan Craib (MD)

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* Ramping up of exploration activities with drill programs commencing in the December quarter 2021.
* Signing of first long term contract(s)
* FID and expediting time-frame to mine and plant restart

[Boss Energy Pros and Cons](https://preview.redd.it/lqfvuuj3yiy71.png?width=704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d80183476c81d5259dcf989511b1cfc6b61f45d3)

# Peninsula Energy (PEN)

**Brief History**

PEN is an Australian listed uranium mining company which commenced in-situ recovery uranium operations at their flagship 100% owned Lance Project (Wyoming) in December 2015. They have an existing contract book with about US$8mill revenue per year despite having their mine shut-in for the past 3 years. They are currently embarking on a trans-formative initiative to change from an alkaline ISR operation to a low pH (acidic) operation with the aim of reducing the cost profile and improving production efficiency. PEN requires approx US$6mill to convert the whole mine from alkaline to pH operation and approx 8months time frame following FID.

**Key Activities Last 6-12 Months**

* Advancing transition to low pH ISR process through field demonstration
   * Demonstration has been operating for 12month - with uranium grades indicating that Lance is better suited to the planned low pH process than previous alkaline based operations.
* FY2021 uranium sales of 275,000 lbs - continue to generate cash for PEN
* An increase in lbs sold and for a higher recognised price per lb
* Cap raise of A$15.4 million (@ $0.015/share) to purchase 300,000 lbs or uranium at US$31.35/lb
* As of June 30th 2021, Net cash of US$6.7mill + 309,507 lbs of uranium inventory (book value of US$9.7mill @ $31.37/lb)

**Potential Catalysts and Forecast Activities**

* US Dept of Energy progressing Uranium Reserve - PEN seeking to be active participant (potential funding from reserve or offtake agreements)
* Completion of field demonstration (started in August 2020, expected to run 18-24months)
* FID and restart of operations (will require some additional funding \~US$6mill)
* Likely to develop additional fields to replace depleting ISR operations ($$)

# Uranium/Nuclear ETFs - ASX Companies

For the u/ASX_Bets crowd here, most of us don’t know what an ETF is, except that we make fun of u/AusFinance for frothing over their 6% returns. But for the uranium market, ETFs are a very important contributor to some of your asx equity gains.

An ETF or exchange traded fund works by holding a portfolio of assets (stocks, bonds, physical commodities, funds) that are usually tracked to an index. The portfolio will hold x% of stock AAA and y% of stock BBB and z% of the commodity for a total weighting up to 100% of tracked assets.

* ^(When the uranium price increases, investors pile into the nuclear/uranium ETFs. If the ETFs trade above their Net Asset Value (NAV) for a period of time they are obliged to buy up additional individual stocks and assets to curve the NAV to fund value.)
* ^(The two major uranium ETFs are URA and URNM and comprise mostly of US/Canadian stocks and funds as well as Kazataprom and Paladin. But as of February-2021 a number of small ASX uranium stocks      were included and added to the “buying list”. This is called rebalancing and involves stocks being added (or removed) and changes in % allocations.)
* ^(The ETFs account for significant fund flows  into the ASX uranium equities as the whole market is still so small. URA “rebalances” twice per year, usually on the last day of January and July, where URNM can rebalance up to four times or quarterly throughout the year.)

**Uranium/Nuclear ETFs and the ASX holdings**

| **VanEck Vectors Uranium + Nuclear Energy ETF** (ARCA: NLR) |PDN|

Inclusions in ETFs are mostly based on market cap being over a certain value for a period of time and a few other factors. It can be worth looking into the criteria and who is not yet included in an ETF and when/what opportunities might be coming up ;)  \*cough \* January 2022 \* Cough.

&gt; Aboriginal landowners have called for a &amp;quot;Reset&amp;quot; in Australia&amp;#039;s lucrative mining sector after an inquiry pilloried Rio Tinto for blowing up a 46,000-year-old heritage site to expand an iron ore mine.

&gt; An Australian parliamentary inquiry recommended late Wednesday that the Anglo-Australian mining giant pay restitution to the PKKP, rebuild the destroyed site and commit to a permanent moratorium on mining in the area.

&gt; The preliminary report also recommended that all mining companies operating in Western Australia review agreements with Indigenous traditional landowners and halt any planned destruction of heritage sites until legal protections are bolstered.

&gt; &amp;quot;We hope the inquiry&amp;#039;s preliminary findings prompt a fundamental reset of the sector, particularly in the relationships between Traditional Owners and mining companies; and pave a way forward for more equal partnerships fostered by greater respect and mutual benefit.""

&gt; Rio Tinto said it was committed to &amp;quot;Never again&amp;quot; destroying culturally significant sites and was working to modernise existing agreements with Indigenous groups as well as rehabilitating the Juukan Gorge area and building a facility to store artefacts removed from the site.

&gt; The site had contained some of the oldest Aboriginal artefacts ever found in Australia and was considered sacred by the PKKP..

&gt; 4 Min Read.MELBOURNE -Mining giant Rio Tinto Ltd should pay restitution to Indigenous Australians affected by its destruction of two ancient rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine, an inquiry panel said on Wednesday.

&gt; The panel released an interim report in which it also recommended Rio Tinto should fully reconstruct the rock shelters in Western Australia&amp;#039;s Pilbara region at its own expense, and laid out broader industry guidance that included reviewing consent practices and a moratorium on mining in the affected places.

&gt; The inquiry did not spell out what, if any, financial compensation Rio Tinto should pay to the traditional owners as part of a negotiated restitution package.

&gt; The parliamentary inquiry into the legal destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May held 13 public hearings, and received more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups.

&gt; The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people whose lands were impacted said in statement they hoped the inquiry&amp;#039;s findings prompted a &amp;quot;Fundamental reset&amp;quot; of the sector, particularly in the relationships between traditional owners and miners.

&gt; &amp;quot;Rio Tinto now needs to turn its words into actions.""

&gt; The chair of a parliamentary committee examining Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s destruction of 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara says the company appears to have misled the inquiry.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is hard to argue that we have not been misled by Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s evidence to the inquiry when you look at what was said together with the documents the company has provided on notice,&amp;quot; Queensland LNP MP Warren Entsch told Guardian Australia.

&gt; The chair&amp;#039;s comments add to pressure from investors and activists for the board of Rio Tinto, which is believed to be meeting this week, to sack chief executive Jean-S&amp;eacute;bastien Jacques over the Juukan Gorge debacle.

&gt; Entsch said Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s reports on Juukan Gorge weren&amp;#039;t done with &amp;quot;Petty cash&amp;quot;.

&gt; In a letter to chairman Simon Thompson, NNTC chief executive Jamie Lowe said Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s appearance before the Senate inquiry and its roundly criticised internal review showed the company had misled the public by blaming failures in &amp;quot;Linked-up decision making&amp;quot; for the destruction of an ancient place.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is now clear that what led to the catastrophic destruction of Juukan Gorge was not a result of a breakdown of procedures but a result of the enormous cultural and values deficit within Rio Tinto,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; Rio Tinto is parting ways with its CEO and two senior executives, bowing to mounting shareholder criticism of the destruction of two significant Aboriginal rock shelters and the global miner&amp;#039;s limited initial response.

&gt; Chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques, who has led Rio since 2016, will step down by March 31 next year, the company said on Friday, after shareholders expressed concerns about executive accountability.

&gt; The move came after activists and investors said Rio had not done enough in an earlier board-led review into how the miner legally detonated rock shelters showing 46,000 years of human habitation at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia against the wishes of traditional owners.

&gt; Jacques last month apologised at an Australian Senate inquiry into the destruction that was against the wishes of Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti, Kurrama and Pinikura people, saying there was no doubt the company could have made better decisions.

&gt; The cave blasts, which enabled Rio to access $135m of high-grade iron ore, drew international condemnation and damaged Rio&amp;#039;s reputation for dealing with Indigenous groups in its worldwide operations.

&gt; &amp;quot;What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,&amp;quot; Rio chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday.

&gt; CANBERRA, Australia - Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques will leave the Anglo-Australian mining giant by March over the destruction of Australian Indigenous sacred sites to access iron ore, the company said on Friday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified,&amp;quot; Rio Tinto said in a statement.

&gt; Rio Tinto concluded in an internal review last month that there was &amp;quot;No single root cause or error that directly resulted in the destruction of the rock shelters.""

&gt; Internal documents revealed last week that Rio Tinto had engaged a law firm in case the traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, applied for a court injunction to save the rock shelters.

&gt; The Western Australian government has promised to update Indigenous heritage laws that allowed Rio Tinto to legally destroy the sacred sites.

&gt; Jamie Lowe, chief executive of the National Native Title Council, which represents Australia&amp;#039;s traditional owners of the land, said he had called on Rio Tinto to take more action than cutting executive bonuses.

&gt; Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s CEO and two other top officers resigned Friday after an uproar over the mining giant&amp;#039;s destruction of an ancient Aboriginal heritage site to expand an iron ore mine in Australia.

&gt; Following a board investigation into the May 24 incident, Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques was stepping down &amp;quot;By mutual agreement&amp;quot; along with the chief of the company&amp;#039;s core Iron Ore division, Chris Salisbury, and corporate relations head Simone Niven.

&gt; &amp;quot;What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,&amp;quot; Thompson said in a statement.

&gt; The three executives had already been forced to forfeit millions of dollars in performance bonuses amid shareholder anger over the destruction of the Aboriginal heritage site.

&gt; The board-led review found Rio Tinto had obtained legal authority to blast the sites but doing so &amp;quot;Fell short of the standards and internal guidance that Rio Tinto sets for itself&amp;quot;.

&gt; Rio Tinto initially defended its blasting in the Juukan Gorge as authorised under a 2013 agreement with the state government.

&gt; Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-S&amp;eacute;bastien Jacques and two other senior executives are leaving the global miner after its board bowed to intense investor pressure for strong action over its decision to blow up 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara.

&gt; Despite leaving the company all three will continue to be entitled to long-term bonuses, Rio Tinto said.

&gt; &amp;quot;While there is general recognition of the transparency of the board review and support for the changes recommended, significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified,&amp;quot; Rio Tinto said.

&gt; In a move that recognised that the board has lacked engagement with Australian issues, the company will also promote non-executive director to senior independent director responsible for oversight of its Australian-listed arm, Rio Tinto Limited.

&gt; Sam Laidlaw will continue as senior independent director responsible for the British half of the group, Rio Tinto plc.

&gt; &amp;quot;What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,&amp;quot; Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s chairman, Simon Thompson, said.

&gt; Rio Tinto hired lawyers to prepare for a potential injunction against the destruction of ancient rock shelters in Juukan Gorge three days before it was destroyed in a mining blast, according to meeting notes released to a parliamentary inquiry.

&gt; The meeting was called after the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners asked Rio Tinto to delay the blasting and named the rock shelter as a significant heritage site.

&gt; The minutes say the PKKP advised Rio Tinto that it planned to issue a press statement, and that its legal team had spoken to lawyers for the PKKP. &amp;quot;Our position is that our participation agreement includes a non-disparagement clause,&amp;quot; the minutes said.

&gt; Rio Tinto would not release the full details of its partnership agreement with the PKKP. But it said that, had the company chosen a design for its Brockman 4 mine pit, which placed a 65m buffer around the gorge, it would have forgone 8.1mt in high grade iron ore, which would be worth $4.7m in benefits payable to the PKKP Aboriginal corporation.

&gt; It said that after the destruction of the rock shelters it had paused all operations in the Juukan Gorge area, which meant that neither Rio Tinto nor the PKKP received any financial benefit from the site.

&gt; Since the blast, Rio Tinto said it had reviewed more than 400 of the 1,780 Aboriginal heritage sites which it currently has approval, under s.18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act WA, to destroy.

&gt; AFP Mining giant Rio Tinto has cut the bonuses of three executives over the destruction of two ancient caves in Australia.

&gt; In May, the world&amp;#039;s biggest iron ore miner destroyed the sacred Aboriginal sites in Pilbara, Western Australia.

&gt; Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques will lose a total of &amp;pound;2.7m. Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will lose payouts of more than half a million pounds each.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is clear that no single individual or error was responsible for the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters,&amp;quot; said Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson.

&gt; &amp;quot;But there were numerous missed opportunities over almost a decade and the company failed to uphold one of Rio Tinto&amp;#039;s core values - respect for local communities and for their heritage.""

&gt; The review found that while the company had obtained legal authority for the blasts, the decision fell short of the standards and internal guidance Rio Tinto had set for itself.

&gt; Mining giant Rio Tinto stripped its CEO of US$3.5 million Monday after the company destroyed a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site to expand an iron ore mine in Australia.

&gt; Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques will forfeit 2.7 million pounds in performance bonuses as a result of the incident, the company announced Monday following a high-level review.

&gt; The board-led review found Rio Tinto had obtained legal authority to blast the sites but doing so &amp;quot;Fell short of the standards and internal guidance that Rio Tinto sets for itself&amp;quot;.

&gt; Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said there had been &amp;quot;Numerous missed opportunities over almost a decade&amp;quot; and the company had failed to respect local communities and their heritage.

&gt; Rio Tinto initially defended its blasting in the Juukan Gorge as authorised under a 2013 agreement with the state government.

&gt; The cultural importance of Juukan Gorge was confirmed by an archaeological dig carried out at one of the rock shelters a year after Rio Tinto obtained approval to blast in the area.

&gt; MELBOURNE - An Australian indigenous group has suspended Rio Tinto from its reconciliation plan after world&amp;#039;s biggest iron ore miner blasted two ancient sacred caves as part of a mine expansion.

&gt; Reconciliation Australia, the lead body for promoting better ties between the wider Australian community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, announced the move after Rio Tinto destroyed the two Aboriginal caves in late May. &amp;quot;The blasting activity in Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto exposes a broken relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurama and Pinikura Peoples and a breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship,&amp;quot; Reconciliation Australia said on Tuesday.

&gt; Rio Tinto was expanding its Brockman mine in the Pilbara region, where one of the caves showed evidence of continual habitation dating back 46,000 years.

&gt; The NGO said that it had met with Rio Tinto executives to convey its &amp;quot;Extreme concern&amp;quot; and that a review of the suspension will depend on how it engages with the Traditional Owner groups.

&gt; It is also dependent on Rio Tinto releasing a full and public review into the matter, sustained action in light of the review, and &amp;quot;Meaningful accountability.""

&gt; &amp;quot;Our heritage processes will be comprehensively reviewed, with board and indigenous leader oversight, to help identify, understand and recommend ways to improve,&amp;quot; Rio Tinto said.

&gt; Mining giant Rio Tinto has apologised to traditional owners in Western Australia&amp;#039;s north after destroying a significant indigenous site dating back 46,000 years, saying it is urgently reviewing plans for other sites in the area.

&gt; &amp;quot;We are sorry for the distress we have caused,&amp;quot; Rio Tinto Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury said in a statement on Sunday.

&gt; &amp;quot;Our relationship with the PKKP matters a lot to Rio Tinto, having worked together for many years.&amp;quot;We will continue to work with the PKKP to learn from what has taken place and strengthen our partnership.

&gt; On Saturday, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation rejected Rio&amp;#039;s suggestion its representatives had failed to make clear concerns about preserving the site during years of consultation between the two parties.

&gt; &amp;quot;The high significance of the site was further relayed to Rio Tinto by PKKPAC as recently as March,&amp;quot; Hayes said.

792,gogkz6,Another Murdoch Smear - Attacking people’s patriotism if they dare challenge any aspect of Morrison’s China Policy,MrKevinRudd,/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/gogkz6/another_murdoch_smear_attacking_peoples/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/gogkz6/another_murdoch_smear_attacking_peoples/,480,181,1590141933.0,"Here’s how the Murdoch Media play it: if you don’t agree with absolutely everything the Liberal Party says and does, you’ll be smeared as a traitor on their latest McCarthyist blacklist. This is the same game they played during the Iraq War when anyone who opposed Howard's invasion was portrayed as siding with “the terrorists”. Also, the same tactics employed during the January mega-fires when Murdoch attacked anyone raising climate change as a causative factor was attacked for “politicising” the crisis when, in Murdoch’s view, the cause was arson.

Sorry Rupert, but in this case criticising Scotty from Marketing isn't the same as having “acted in support of China” - as you now allege in your loyal factotum Ben English’s propaganda bulletin (aka The Daily Telegraph).

On the question of an independent inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, the public record demonstrates that I signed an open letter together with 100 former US Secretaries of State, National Security Advisors and heads of other institutions on April 3 calling for such an international investigation – more than two weeks before Morrison ventilated his own ideas on this subject.

My main criticism of the Morrison proposal for an international inquiry was that it was advanced publicly without signing up other major co-sponsors from around the world beforehand. That would have put extra muscle behind the initiative. It would also have made it harder for Beijing to single out Australia for individual economic retribution, because there is strength in numbers.

A second criticism is that Morrison had not thought through the machinery for any such inquiry, also explicitly (and rightly) ruling out the WHO conducting an inquiry into Itself because it would be Caesar judging Caesar. Guess what! When Morrison finally figured out that his own “proposal” was not gaining international traction, he decided to save political face and swing in behind a pre-existing and much weaker European Union proposal to have the WHO organise its own inquiry with much softer terms of reference.

This brings us to the third weakness - which is the fact that if you look at the actual operative clauses of the World Health Assembly resolution on COVID-19, they don’t add up to much at all. There are two relevant clauses (9.6 and 9.10). One refers to the continuing work of existing international scientific bodies looking into the “zoonotic origins of the virus and the route of its introduction to the human population” - no reference to China, and no reference to any new investigation. The second refers to a new investigation by the WHO itself “at the earliest appropriate moment” into the “lessons learned” and “experience gained” from WHO‘s handling of the crisis. Indeed, elsewhere in the resolution, the World Health Assembly, supported by Australia, without qualification, commends the WHO for its work.

So this is the end result that Morrison now trumpets as the great success of his efforts in securing the robust, independent global investigation into the Chinese origins of the virus which would, under no circumstances, involve the WHO investigating itself! Give us a break! Another PR ploy from Scotty from Marketing. 

As for the deliberate smear that my challenging the truth of Murdoch’s bullshit claims are those of a “cheerleader for China”, Murdoch’s bullyboys might want to review what I’ve actually said during this COVID crisis. In just the last three days, I’ve said:

-- “Whatever is said by various spokesmen and women on behalf of the Chinese government, there are legitimate questions for the international community to know the answer to.” (BBC, 19 May)
-- “This is not a bunch of Sunday School teachers. This is a hard, hardened Soviet-style Leninist regime.” (New European, 19 May)
-- “We’re a liberal democracy that believes in universal human rights. That’s not going to change much as our Chinese friends may wish that.” (Eureka Report, 20 May)

Sorry none of that fits the script, Rupert. But never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.

I've always backed a hard-line policy on China. It's the Liberals who've changed their tune. When I was in office, they would join Murdoch's columnists in attacking me for being too hard on China. After all, it was my government that:
-- Rejected China’s determined efforts to take over Rio Tinto
-- Excluded Huawei hardware from being used in the NBN rollout
-- Spoke out about human rights abuses in Tibet and provided visas to dissidents from Xinjiang
-- Enhanced ASIO’s resources to deal with state-sponsored espionage
-- Formally identified China’s rise as a regional military challenge in the 2009 Defence White Paper
-- Partnered with Barack Obama to bring US Marines to Darwin, and
-- Beefed up the Royal Australian Navy in response to developments in the South China Sea.

Here is what The Australian wrote about my handling of the China relationship in September 2012: ""Rudd's leadership was characterised by the worst period in Sino-Australian relations for a decade or longer as he lectured China on Tibet, named the country as a threat in a Defence white paper and gave a visa to exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer. Canberra was seen as complicit in the failure of Chinalco to gain a bigger stake in Rio Tinto, amid intense friction between the two nations over iron ore prices and the jailing of Australian Rio executive Stern Hu.""

Back then, Murdoch was busy praising Tony Abbott for sacrificing Australia’s core values to ingratiate himself with Beijing. Business leaders like James Packer and Kerry Stokes, who viewed Australia’s national interest through the prism of how much money they can make, also attacked my handling of the relationship because we refused to kowtow. And who could forget Turnbull's famous opinion piece for Murdoch's Australian, attacking our defence white paper as that of a Cold War warrior, by claiming China is “not a security threat""?! Of course, Abbott and Turnbull later signed up to be Beijing's ""comprehensive strategic partner"" and they sacrificed key Australian negotiating positions to secure a trade agreement. They then handed the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company and reviewed the ban on Huawei equipment being used in the NBN rollout. But all this is now swept under the carpet by the giant Liberal Party protection racket that the Murdoch mafia have become.

So why have the Murdoch media launched this smear? It's so predictable. This is all retribution for me calling out the Murdoch media, in Australia and overseas, for claiming a non-existent “Five Eyes” intelligence dossier backed Donald Trump’s conspiracy claims that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory. Trump’s claimed evidence has been forcefully refuted by Australian spy agencies - and even by Greg Sheridan over at Murdoch’s Australian, who says: “All the relevant Australian agencies have looked closely at the question and consulted all their counterpart allied agencies, including in the US, and the end of that process is the Australian assessment is there is no evidence that the virus came from the lab.”

The Murdoch media’s overreach runs the real risk of backfiring, gifting a propaganda victory to Beijing if and when it is formally disproven. But Murdoch is so obsessed with backing Trump and his best mate Morrison that they’ll publish whatever weasel words they can get away with.

I find them very interesting. Specifically the point I threw into the title. What do you think? 

&gt;""MEDIA RELEASE

&gt;After an initial review of the Henry Report, WA First Senate Candidate Scott Cowans made the following remarks Sunday afternoon:
&gt;
&gt;“This is a very disappointing and dangerous report for WA because it further weakens our State Government whilst transferring significant wealth to New South Wales and Victoria.
&gt;
&gt;The report aims to take profits from mining companies and give them to non-mining companies through the tax system. This means instead of re-investing profits into future production, WA mining companies will fund massive tax breaks for big businesses. Telstra and the four major banks will receive a $380 million tax break fully funded by mining companies. This is totally unfair considering the four major banks generate $2 billion more net profit after tax than the entire global profits of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. 
&gt;
&gt;Why has the government picked on mining companies with the bulk of their staff and assets in WA when they could have introduced a special tax on banks instead to fund their new tax system? Is it because there are less voters in WA?
&gt;
&gt;The Commonwealth says it will negotiate with the States on its implementation of the report's recommendations. Colin Barnett must be warned that Kevin Rudd will be sitting at the negotiating table with two cards hidden up his sleeve. 
&gt;
&gt;The first card: In the report's summary it says a credit for state royalties will be available to offset the new mining tax. Then hidden deep in the detail of the report is the statement, “The refundable credit will be available at least up to the [indexed] amount of royalties imposed at the time of the announcement.” This prevents WA from increasing mining royalties beyond current levels, despite the fact the State Government is in the middle of negotiations with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to increase their royalties. The Commonwealth is stepping into the middle of these negotiations and stealing the increase owed entirely to WA taxpayers. The sneaky part of the Commonwealth strategy is by locking in royalties at the current rate, WAs long-term ability to alter mining royalties to respond to changing circumstances is eliminated. In other words, the WA Government will lose control over one of its key sources of revenue forever.
&gt;
&gt;The second card: the Commonwealth argues they're providing a trade-off through an infrastructure fund with $700 million going in the “majority to resource rich states”. However, there's no specifics – these will be open to “negotiation”. So just like the attempted takeover of hospitals, we'll see some short-term funding promises that aren't guaranteed for the long-term. Why isn't there a mechanism in the report defining exactly what percentage of the new mining tax WA will receive as infrastructure funding on a permanent basis? The answer is because the Federal Government wants to have the ability to reduce payments to WA in the future, just as they did with the GST.
&gt;
&gt;The report also fails to address the severe and increasing imbalance between WA's GST, corporate and personal tax payments and the benefits WA receives from Canberra. WA Treasury estimated this at $8 billion in 2007-08.2 Considering the Henry Tax Report will raise $9 billion from mining companies by 2013-14, the subsidy WA provides to the other States will increase dramatically.
&gt;
&gt;This underfunding of WA is dangerous as WA desperately needs more funding for essential services. In the same weekend the Henry Report was released, ""The Weekend Australian"" reported WA had 21% of the nation's bottom 100 schools and only 3% of the top 100 schools.
&gt;
&gt;In the week leading up to the Report's release, WA hospital emergency departments spent a total of 19 hours diverting ambulances to other hospitals, and urgent emergency patients had a mean waiting time of over 25 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;In the four months leading up the Report's release, 50 Western Australians were killed on our roads.4 According to the RAC, 1000 kilometres of WA highways are substandard and need urgent upgrades.

&gt;And in the latest financial year before the Report's release, 36,332 WA properties were broken into and over 50% of robberies with firearms went unsolved.

&gt;This report is a crucial turning point in the on-going takeover of State Government powers by the Federal Government. The only place the report can be amended or blocked is in the Senate which is why it's so important WA First Senators are elected.”

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\*

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

I am in no way associated to RVSN and like many of you have only recently discovered them via a post from BestPhone here on Reddit (massive thanks mate….ive done well so far and hopeful about the future on this one!)  

Being someone who is highly suspicious, particularly of something which seems ¨hyped¨ or ¨too good to be true¨ i have been trying to conduct a through assessment of the company, its associations, partners, board members and any red flags in terms of this being a ¨pump and dump¨

I currently hold just over 4000 shares. Given the big dip across the market, particularly small caps, it is natural to feel a bit nervous/stupid/unsure if you are being played……..so with the market being closed today i wanted to try and make sure that i am not 

Essentially, from what i can find out - if we are, then we are in very good company including Nvidia, UBS, the EU and lots more, all of whom will have conducted due diligence into the company, its key members, its finances and its products…... Which leads me to conclude we are probably not! 

I share my findings here to help you make your own decision about the company 

Firstly (spoiler alert) i am even more of a fan of this company having done this exercise….i honestly tried to find things to be worried about but the only tiny concern i can find is one board members association to SciSpark which i see as a bit of a dodgy pump and dump tbh….but its a very loose association based on one board members (OZ Adler) and given they are both Israeli companies i dont think it means much. Every other aspect seem super legit 

So i will start by recapping some very good news for RVSN since Dec 4th. All of these articles can be looked at online via various sources including RVSN website and Reuters news .

While challenges exist, the company’s alignment with industry trends and its extensive network of partnerships position it well for sustainable growth in the short to mid-term.
My assessment 

Unless RVSN have managed to ¨pull the woll¨over the eyes of the EU, MXV, NVIDIA, UBS, the Israeli government, Rio Tinto, Knorr-Bremse and lots more very reputable, globally respected organisations in a scam worthy of Oceans 11, RVSN seem to be a legit company with an experienced board of Directors and a number of very important partnerships to start commercialising cutting edge, patented AI safety products 

In light of that, for me, these are the decisions to be made when considering RVSN as an investment opportunity 

Will AI, Machine learning and big data play a part in transport safety in years to come 

Does the company have unique and cutting edge technology to bring to market 

Is there a sizable market (TAM) and need for the products 

Does the company have the approvals, partners and distribution network to start to commercialise 


Personally, particularly after this exercise in fact finding, i believe the answer to all the above to be a resounding YES 

Make your own decisions of course and none of the above is intended to influence that decision but hopefully it saves you some time and collects some valuable insights together to help us invest sensibly and safely in a small cap, late stage start up",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:29.346240,2025-01-12T01:17:06,RT,2025
798,1m478ha,Anthony Albanese’s high-stakes China strategy,Ardeet,/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1m478ha/anthony_albaneses_highstakes_china_strategy/,https://www.afr.com/world/asia/beyond-the-wall-albanese-s-high-stakes-china-play-20250708-p5mddn,0,21,1752959639.0,"# Beyond the Wall: Albanese’s high-stakes China play

As the prime minister is criticised over the extent of his China sightseeing activities, the government insists it is playing the long game and that face time matters.

  
As Anthony Albanese peered into the leafy panda enclosures in China’s sweltering city of Chengdu, criticism of the prime minister’s unusually long six-day trip was building back home.

Unlike previous visits that produced splashy joint communiques or major trade breakthroughs, this one yielded no single trophy announcement to parade in Canberra.

A handful of MoUs and a fresh climate-focused partnership – welcomed but hardly monumental – were signed. The real prize, Albanese and his advisers seem to believe, lies in the long game.

“One of the things that I find about giving countries respect is that you get it back,” he told reporters as he wrapped up his visit.

Albanese’s first term in office brought the phrase “stabilisation” into currency as a means of how Australia would repair relations with China and restore $20 billion in lost trade.

It was clear from this week’s visit that the communist regime and Australian businesses are keen to build on that and resume the heady days of economic integration with China. But there is reluctance from Albanese to move too far or too fast. He sees maintaining “stabilisation” itself as a tough but worthy objective at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions, exacerbated by Donald Trump’s trade war and unpredictability, Russia’s protracted battle in Ukraine and China’s efforts to redraw the global order on more favourable terms.

Albanese’s strategy of respect took shape across three Chinese cities – Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu – and more than a dozen official engagements. It focused on acknowledging China’s global rise, reinforcing Australia’s economic relevance in a rapidly transforming region, and quietly drawing firm boundaries on values and security without derailing the dialogue.

The symbolism wasn’t subtle. Albanese and partner Jodie Haydon cooed over pandas and sweated atop the Great Wall, all the while flanked by dozens of Chinese officials eager to roll out the red carpet.

For Beijing, these scenes matter. They signal that Australia recognises China’s ascendant position – and is willing to play the choreography of diplomacy properly.

“We respect the long-term vision China brings to these relationships,” Albanese says.

**The Chinese Communist Party has always prized** clarity and parameters in its bilateral dealings.

Canberra’s current approach – ringfencing thorny issues such as Taiwan, human rights abuses and jailed Australian writer Yang Hengjun, while talking up trade, economic ties and people-to-people links – seems to suit China.

It also suits China that Albanese’s visit comes at a time of rare public friction between Canberra and Washington. Albanese is unlikely to hold a first face-to-face meeting with Trump until September, and the White House and the Pentagon are pushing Australia to dramatically lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product.

Albanese touched down in Shanghai last Saturday as a report in *The Financial Times* said Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for defence policy, had been pushing Australian and Japanese officials to make clear what role they would play if the US and China went to war over Taiwan. Colby’s questioning had an added edge, given the review of plans to sell second-hand nuclear-powered submarines as part of the AUKUS pact.

Amid this tension, China’s charm offensive went into overdrive. Albanese spent nearly five hours with Xi and Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday in Beijing, including a lunch with Xi at the Great Hall of the People.

However, supporters of the government’s strategy say this isn’t about deference. It’s about survival in a shifting world order. Li left little doubt that China saw itself not as a manufacturing workhorse, but as the next global tech-industrial hegemon. “You’d need to catch all the lobsters in the sea to feed China,” he boasted to business leaders during the trip, a comment designed to illustrate China’s vast size.

From green steel to electric vehicles to AI platforms such as DeepSeek, China is rapidly moving up the value chain. That shift puts pressure on Australia’s commodity-led model.

For decades, China bought whatever iron ore Australia could dig out of the ground. Now, as steel demand plateaus and stockpiles mount, China is demanding higher grade, less polluting and cheaper ore. State-owned China Mineral Resources Group has amassed billions in reserves, giving Beijing leverage to buffer its struggling construction sector while bypassing volatile global prices.

Australia’s top miners, including BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue, have noticed. They spent the week promoting “green iron” – code for ore mined using renewable energy – to shore up the $105 billion in annual sales to their biggest customers.

Yet, the challenge remains steep: the world is awash in iron ore, and China can afford to be choosy. At the same time, Beijing’s climate commitments are real. It cannot allow its megacities to remain smog-choked. That gives Australia a role, if it can evolve quickly enough.

But in the tech space, Albanese was deliberately cautious. Throughout the week, he repeatedly avoided calls for closer collaboration between Australian start-ups and Chinese digital giants. The idea of Australia and China collaborating on artificial intelligence is problematic, given China’s profligate cyber intrusions and the government’s ban on public servants using DeepSeek.

With knowledge transfer in sensitive fields such as AI and quantum computing effectively off the table, that leaves a core tension in Australia’s China policy. Canberra appears content – at least for now – to sell the shovels for China’s green revolution, but not join in building its digital future.

**It’s a delicate dance**, and there was strong criticism of Albanese’s China trip – that eating Peking duck in opulent banquet halls while Taiwan is under threat and writer Yang remains detained is an unacceptable moral compromise.

“One of China’s highest strategic priorities is to encourage strategically and geopolitically passive behaviour by US allies in the region,” says John Lee, a senior fellow at US think tank the Hudson Institute and a one-time adviser to former foreign minister Julie Bishop.

“Beijing will feel that the Albanese government is trending in this direction as Beijing will have hoped,” he tells *AFR Weekend*. “It is Albanese’s lack of willingness to have blunt conversations about deep differences that will alarm Washington.”

He criticises the Albanese government for allowing itself to be feted and upheld as an example of a well-behaved ally by Beijing without demanding any changes in Chinese behaviour.

“In DC, Albanese’s notion of stabilisation of relations with China will be seen as a euphemism for Australia opting out of dealing with difficult issues with Beijing,” Lee says.

As an example, he cites what he describes as Albanese’s unwillingness to have a serious discussion about the Taiwan Straits, despite it being the biggest flashpoint for a potential war between China and the US.

“Albanese says Australia supports the status quo and yet it is China that is incrementally and coercively changing the status almost daily with their grey zone activities,” Lee says.

“This needed a more in-depth discussion of Australia’s opposition to this \[and\] that appears not to have taken place. Had that kind of discussion occurred, Beijing would not have been as pleased about the visit.

“To lead such a large Australian gathering without raising issues of Chinese predatory and illegal economic behaviour is another example. That is the point: Albanese is allowing China to determine what Australian comfort levels ought to be.”

But Albanese insists such concerns are raised – in hours-long private sessions, not over dumplings.

“These things take time,” he said this week.

As strategic rivalry between the United States and China intensifies – across military, economic and technological fronts – both superpowers are racing to cement their influence over the next century of global growth. Albanese acknowledges that China is more confident about its role as a power in the world than ever before.

But as China continues to think in decades, even centuries, Australia may soon have to answer harder questions. How far is it willing to align with China’s strategic vision? And can it navigate that alignment without jeopardising its alliance with Washington?

“The prime minister’s drawn-out visit to China leaves no doubt about his seriousness when it comes to risk-informed engagement with our region’s dominating power,” says Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College and a former Australian diplomat.

“It consolidates the patient diplomacy of the government’s stabilisation agenda. It also raises expectations that there is much more the two nations can do together. Yet, it is hard to see how much further we can go without increasing Australia’s vulnerability to geopolitical shocks or deepening economic reliance on an authoritarian power that has form when it comes to translating dependence into coercion.

“The PM and Australian officials can take some satisfaction from their feat of diplomatic choreography – touching on the hard issues as well as the easy ones, yet maintaining diplomatic poise.

“But there is no escaping the dissonance with other present realities, including Taiwan’s drills in self-defence and our massive military exercises with the United States, Japan and many other partners, preparing for the precise conflicts and crises the PM was at pains to avoid speculating about.

“The awkward timing of the China visit amid troubled times in our US alliance diplomacy is obvious. What is more uncertain is how Australia’s new China focus will be seen among the many other players in a multipolar world – Japan, India, other Asian friends and Europe.”

Albanese believes he is charting a middle course in sync with other Asian neighbours such as Singapore and Indonesia that can seek a balance without blowing up bilateral relationships.

Nevertheless, tensions remain. Behind the bonhomie, Chinese officials and state-run propaganda outlets made it clear there were still points of tension, such as Li’s public demand that Chinese companies be treated fairly under Australia’s foreign investment regime or the Darwin Port.

Albanese is standing firm on his election promise to return the port into Australian hands. Security hawks in Canberra have long argued that the Chinese-owned Landbridge lease of the port threatens national security.

Beijing has signalled anger over the plan, with Chinese ambassador Xiao Qian labelling it “ethically questionable”. And analysts have warned that China may look to retaliate if there is a forced sale.

“China won’t want to set a global precedent by letting Australia reclaim a port without consequence,” says Lowy Institute senior fellow Richard McGregor. “Australia will have to be seen to pay a price. The issue of ports is not just about Australia. It goes much further than that.

“Chinese state companies have built an extensive network of ports around the world – more than 100 ports in about 50 countries. They do not want to see a precedent set in Australia which could be followed by governments elsewhere in the world.”

However, Albanese says the issue was not raised during talks. And he has defended his trip.

“It’s important that we build stability and security in our world. And part of that has to be positive engagement. That’s what I’m doing here,” he says.

What’s clear is that both sides are taking the visit as a win. The open reception, the eagerness to discuss shared environmental goals, and the tacit acknowledgement of China’s enormous technology ambitions mark a shift in tone in the relationship. Whether that translates into enduring strategic trust – or simply transactional co-operation – remains to be seen.

CSL has urged the Trump administration to target hostile countries that could weaponise the supply of pharmaceuticals rather than place a blanket tariff on medicines as it lobbies for exemptions of duties of up to 200 per cent flagged by the White House in its expanding trade war.

The country’s [largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/csl-says-on-track-for-double-digit-growth-but-vaccine-sales-weak-20250210-p5lb0u) told US officials investigating the import of medicines that it understood President Donald Trump’s “concern that certain countries may ‘weaponise’ control over pharmaceutical supplies” and said this was the best reason for the government to focus its work on “specific non-allied countries”.

Donald Trump’s tariff on pharmaceutical products would affect more than $2 billion in Australian exports, largely made up of CSL’s goods manufactured in Melbourne. Australian Financial Review

The argument was contained in a detailed submission to the Commerce Department, which has begun reviewing imports in response to requests from the Trump administration. The investigation paves the way for the president to impose tariffs on national security grounds.

After [months of negotiation](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/pharmaceuticals-to-be-hit-by-major-trump-tariff-csl-slumps-5pc-20250409-p5lqeo), and little discussion of tariff plans, Trump on Wednesday said he wanted to place levies not only on pharmaceuticals but on copper, a move that could affect BHP and Rio Tinto, along with smaller ASX-listed producers like MAC Copper and Aeris Resources.

“I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50 per cent,” Trump said when asked by a reporter what the rate on those products would be.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said later in an interview on CNBC that the duties could take effect later in July or on August 1. It was unclear at what stage of the copper processing cycle tariffs would kick in.

The tariffs are the latest attempt by the White House to implement Trump’s America First agenda, which seeks to revive US manufacturing by making imports more expensive.

They follow 50 per cent levies on [steel and aluminium](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/trump-signs-order-hiking-steel-aluminium-tariffs-to-50pc-20250604-p5m4rg), and are separate from the country-specific tariffs on most goods imported into the country that kick in on August 1.

While little copper is exported from Australia directly to the US, a tariff on pharmaceutical products would affect more than $2 billion in exports, largely made up of goods manufactured at CSL’s plant in Melbourne.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Wednesday said the prospect of such a large hit on pharmaceuticals was a major concern, adding that the government was urgently seeking more details on the plan Trump had announced.

“But I want to make it really clear once again, as we have on a number of occasions before, our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not something that we’re willing to trade away or do deals on. That won’t change,” he said.

Major American pharmaceutical companies have long complained about the PBS, saying the scheme often subsidises cheaper generic products. Some of the biggest US businesses including Eli Lilly, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also lobbied the White House to force Australia to [pay more for drugs on the PBS,](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/why-us-drug-giants-are-so-angry-about-australia-s-pbs-20250320-p5ll10) and accelerate the approval process.

In its submission to the Commerce Department investigation, obtained by *The Australian Financial Review*, CSL executive Michael Deem said the US should exempt Australia, Switzerland, the European Union and the United Kingdom in a bid to reduce its concerns about medicines supply.

The submission also calls for tariffs to be phased in over five years to allow for supply chain adjustments, and an exemption for equipment used by the biotech sector to produce medicines. CSL said the tariff plan would increase costs for patients and limit their access to therapies.

“CSL encourages the US government to focus its investigation on these specific non-allied countries, rather than on all imports of pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other derivative articles from the many trading countries that have been reliable partners in the past,” it said.

CSL has 19,000 staff in the US, about 60 per cent of its workforce and has announced plans to invest $2 billion in production in the country.

Its products are made from blood plasma collected in the US, but they are fractionated – the process of separating whole blood into its individual components – in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. Blood plasma products are used to treat a range of life-threatening diseases.

CSL shares fell slightly, down $2.23 to close at $243.71. The minimal move suggests investors have already priced in the potential US tariffs, with the stock sliding almost 20 per cent over the last 12 months.

“It is weighing on the share price because CSLs’ earnings growth has been good, but the shares have gone down. They don’t believe the impact of the tariffs will be high, but the problem is the devil is in the detail and the goalposts keep shifting,” Investors Mutual senior portfolio manager Hugh Giddy said.

“The trouble with Trump is nothing ever seems final. He seems to want to make a threat to force people to negotiate, so the ultimate end point is often so different to the original announcement.”

A CSL spokesman declined to comment further.

CSL accounts for the bulk of Australia’s pharmaceutical exports to the US, but investors said steep tariffs would damage confidence in healthcare and biotech companies, particularly start-ups seeking investment.

“Uncertainty in the health sector that this creates has a negative impact on the view of Australia as an attractive place to invest in R&amp;D in the health sector and clinical trials in particular,” King &amp; Wood Mallesons partner Suzy Madar said.

“The impact is likely to be much greater on the smaller end of town, closer to the start-up phase, where they don’t have that opportunity.”

Some analysts have noted that any tariff on exports from Australia could damage US pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, [which has a local manufacturing facility](https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/pfizer-invests-150m-in-melbourne-to-fight-superbugs-20240805-p5jznt) where it produces oncology pharmaceuticals that are sent to North America. AstraZeneca also manufactures in Australia.

Medicines Australia, which represents the local pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry, said Australia imported more medicines from the US than it exported.

“We also believe introducing tariffs on US imports of innovative medicines is not going to encourage Australian manufacturers to relocate to the US, but it will be detrimental to US competitiveness and increase their healthcare costs,” a spokesman said on Wednesday.

The White House is expected to begin imposing other, country-specific tariffs from August 1, having paused them in April.

Exporters from Australia will pay the 10 per cent baseline tariff applied on several countries.

Japan and South Korea, two of Australia’s biggest trading partners after China, were told this week [they faced tariffs of 25 per cent](https://www.afr.com/world/asia/no-escape-for-allies-japan-south-korea-in-trump-s-tariff-update-20250708-p5mday) on most exports.

The Trump administration is weighing an equity stake in Critical Metals Corp, a New York-based company developing Greenland’s Tanbreez rare earths project. According to four people familiar with the talks, **Washington could convert a proposed $50 million Defense Production Act grant into an equity stake of roughly 8%.** While no agreement has been finalized, the move underscores U.S. efforts to secure critical minerals vital to electric vehicles, defense technologies, and semiconductors.

Critical Metals purchased the Tanbreez deposit last year for $5 million in cash and $211 million in stock, reportedly outbidding a higher Chinese offer thanks to U.S. government backing. The deposit holds significant quantities of rare earths, gallium, and tantalum—resources largely dominated by China. Once operational, Tanbreez is expected to produce 85,000 metric tons of concentrate annually, with full production targeted by 2026.

**This potential investment follows similar U.S. stakes in Lithium Americas and MP Materials, reflecting a broader strategy to diversify supply chains away from Chinese dominance. The Trump administration has also considered reallocating $2 billion from the CHIPS Act—originally aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing—to support critical minerals projects.**

***In addition to the possible equity stake, the U.S. Export-Import Bank is reviewing a $120 million loan to accelerate development of Tanbreez***. That funding would cover technical work and bring the project into production. Despite the momentum, challenges remain, including Greenland’s slow-moving mining sector, environmental concerns, and the harsh Arctic conditions surrounding the site.

Greenland’s strategic importance is not new. Both Trump and Biden administrations have sought stronger ties, with senior officials visiting Nuuk to encourage investment. Trump even floated the idea of buying Greenland outright in 2019. **Today, the focus has shifted to securing rare earths—critical for national security and future technologies—making the Tanbreez project a centerpiece of Washington’s mineral strategy.**

# Oct. 4th 2025~Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025

[Navigating the Surge: How Mining Can Meet Critical Mineral Demand Sustainably Beyond 2025 - MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/sponsored-content/navigating-the-surge-how-mining-can-meet-critical-mineral-demand-sustainably-beyond-2025/)

[Meeting Soaring Demand for Critical Minerals](https://preview.redd.it/ymhamhezk2tf1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e716cca2fdeb6f119635b14060b7108ef6ca69)

The most critical issue facing global mining companies beyond 2025 is the surge in demand for energy transition minerals—such as copper, lithium, and nickel—against a backdrop of supply chain stress, regulatory scrutiny, and rapidly evolving sustainability expectations. Addressing this challenge requires smarter, more integrated management of mineral sourcing, sustainability impacts, and market risk.

As the world accelerates toward decarbonization, the International Energy Agency projects that demand for critical minerals will at least triple by 2030. Meanwhile, global supply chains remain fragmented, with extraction and refining concentrated in a few countries and complicated by geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and fluctuating prices. *Traditional mining operations are challenged to scale up production quickly and responsibly while maintaining transparency, traceability, and compliance across dozens of jurisdictions.*

**Supply Chain Complexity and Ethical Sourcing**

Supply chain complexity and ethical sourcing have become critical challenges for mining companies amid growing global scrutiny on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. The supply chains for critical minerals now span multiple countries and involve numerous tiers of suppliers, each subject to different regulatory regimes and ethical expectations. This fragmentation creates significant risks—from exposure to labor rights violations and environmental damage to supply disruptions caused by compliance failures or geopolitical factors.

To address these challenges, mining companies require integrated digital platforms that consolidate and monitor real-time data from extraction through processing to final delivery. These platforms automate supplier audits, track certifications, and validate compliance with evolving ESG regulations, including conflict minerals legislation and responsible sourcing frameworks. By creating a single source of truth for supply chain transparency, organizations can detect and mitigate risks earlier, ensure ethical practices across their value chain, and generate the documentation needed for investor reporting and customer assurance.

**Sustainability and ESG Expectations**

Sustainability and ESG expectations are rapidly becoming paramount in the mining industry as stakeholders increasingly demand transparent, accountable, and responsible operations. Mining companies face mounting pressure from governments, investors, local communities, and civil society to minimize environmental footprints, mitigate climate risk, and deliver positive social outcomes.

By 2050, over 60% of mining firms aim to achieve net-zero emissions or carbon neutrality, leading to wide-scale adoption of renewable energy, electrification of fleets, and precision mining techniques designed to reduce land disturbance and pollution.

Robust ESG frameworks increasingly govern mining operations, reflecting the growing demand for responsible and transparent practices. Among the most significant developments is the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative (CMSI), which unites the best elements of four leading standards—the Copper Mark’s Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA), Mining Association of Canada’s Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM), World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles, and ICMM’s Mining Principles—into a single, unified global standard. This consolidation simplifies the complexity of the current standards landscape and sets clear, high-bar expectations for responsible mining practices across ethical business conduct, worker and social safeguards, social performance, and environmental stewardship.

Alongside CMSI, key international frameworks such as ISO standards and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol continue to play vital roles in aligning environmental management and carbon emissions reporting within mining operations. Additionally, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Mining Sector Standard 2024 and the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) 2.0 provide rigorous, auditable benchmarks for sustainability and social responsibility, enabling mining companies to deliver transparent and credible ESG disclosures.

These standards require detailed, auditable disclosures on climate impact, water stewardship, emissions, and social governance, pushing mining companies towards consistent, comparable, and trustworthy reporting.

Together, these frameworks and standards promote continual improvement and accountability in mining’s environmental, social, and governance performance. They guide the industry toward harmonized reporting, diligent risk management, and enhanced stakeholder trust, helping mining companies meet the expectations of regulators, investors, communities, and customers worldwide.

Automated digital platforms that consolidate environmental and social data, support compliance, reduce manual workload, and enable rapid adaptation to evolving regulatory contexts.

**Geopolitical Uncertainty**

Geopolitical uncertainty has emerged as a central risk for mining companies striving to meet the booming demand for critical minerals in 2025. Resource nationalism, shifting regulatory landscapes, and the concentration of mineral extraction and refining in just a handful of countries have made supply chains more fragile and unpredictable. Governments are increasingly enacting export controls, renegotiating mining agreements, and imposing higher environmental and social standards—all of which can abruptly alter the business landscape for global miners.

In this high-stakes environment, advanced risk management solutions provide crucial strategic support—they enable dynamic scenario modeling, track global regulatory changes, and facilitate swift adaptation to new requirements. With real-time intelligence and agile compliance workflows, mining companies can proactively respond to evolving risks, protect their operations, and maintain competitiveness on the world stage.

**Technology’s Role in Meeting Demand**

Technology plays a vital role in helping mining companies meet the rapidly growing global demand for critical minerals by enhancing operational efficiency, transparency, and compliance while reducing environmental and social risks. In 2025 and beyond, digital transformation in mining includes the integration of AI, automation, and advanced analytics into daily operations, enabling companies to scale production sustainably and responsibly.

Advanced platforms enable real-time data collection from connected machinery, sensors, and personnel, providing a comprehensive view of operations that supports predictive maintenance, minimizes equipment downtime, and improves workplace safety. This integration of operational data with environmental, health, safety, and compliance metrics facilitates proactive risk management, faster incident response, and streamlined reporting to regulators and investors.

Transparency and traceability are critical concerns in critical mineral supply chains. Blockchain and digital ledger technologies play a growing role in creating immutable, verifiable records of mineral extraction, processing, and delivery, assuring stakeholders of the ethical and environmental integrity of sourced materials. These technologies automate supplier compliance verification and third-party audit management, making ethical sourcing scalable and credible.

Solutions like IsoMetrix exemplify how integrated digital platforms can transform mining operations. IsoMetrix’s software consolidates environmental, health, safety, risk, and sustainability data into a single system with configurable workflows and intuitive dashboards. This enables mining companies to monitor complex regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions, automate compliance processes, and generate transparent, auditable ESG and HSEC reports aligned to global standards. With embedded analytics and alerts, organizations can identify emerging risks early, optimize resource use, and improve decision-making across all operational levels.

Furthermore, IsoMetrix supports the digital upskilling of mine workforces by managing training, competency assessments, and incident investigations in a unified system. This strengthens workforce safety culture and sustains compliance with evolving health and safety regulations.

In sum, the role of technology in meeting the demand for critical minerals extends beyond automation. Integrated software platforms designed for holistic environmental, social, and operational risk management, such as IsoMetrix, enable mining companies to deliver higher productivity, enhanced compliance, and greater transparency—transforming risk into resilience and competitive advantage in today’s complex industry landscape.

# Oct. 2nd, 2025~J.P. Morgan leads groundbreaking rare earth magnets deal

[J.P. Morgan Leads Groundbreaking Rare Earth Magnets Deal](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/banking/investment-banking/mp-materials)

***The public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Defense and MP Materials accelerates the buildout of a U.S.-based rare earths supply chain.***

https://preview.redd.it/dd2bmybcl2tf1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9cdd8a3dca0cd6ecf2037f6cbbbb7e8542262f7

In late April, on the back of China’s new export controls, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and MP Materials began discussions on how to secure a U.S.-based supply chain of rare earth magnets — essential resources for the production of everything from F-35 jets to iPhones.

That discussion evolved into a deal that saw the DoD become the largest shareholder and customer of MP Materials, which is America’s only fully integrated rare earth magnets producer. This first-of-its-kind arrangement, in which J.P. Morgan was the sole financial advisor and lead left arranger on $1 billion of committed financing, carries key strategic implications for the U.S. and nearshores a critical industry at a time when the evolving geopolitical landscape could disrupt supply chains around the world.

The DoD rarely takes direct equity interests — it mostly issues loans or grants — so there was no blueprint for this arrangement, which included complex commercial, financial and regulatory elements.

***“I think this is one of — if not the most — unique transactions you’ll ever see. There just aren’t a lot of public-private partnerships that resemble an M&amp;A deal like this one.”***

***Andrew Castaldo***

***Co-head of Mid-Cap M&amp;A, J.P. Morgan***

An all-hands-on-deck effort

J.P. Morgan delivered, advising on the structuring and negotiation of the transaction and helping to arrange a $1 billion financing commitment within an ""eight-week timeframe"", which required an all-hands-on-deck effort from senior members of the firm.

“I’ve never done anything like this and I’ve been doing this work for 30 years,” said Andrew Castaldo, co-head of Mid-Cap M&amp;A at J.P. Morgan. “I think this is one of — if not the most — unique transactions you’ll ever see. There just aren’t a lot of public-private partnerships that resemble an M&amp;A deal like this one.”

MP Materials operates the Mountain Pass Mine in California, about an hour south of Las Vegas. It is the only scaled rare earth producer in the U.S. and, with a rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, has capabilities spanning the entire supply chain for these critical elements.     

The final deal with the DoD will give the company the resources to build an additional manufacturing facility named 10X, which will increase its magnet production to 10,000 metric tons. In practical terms, this will address all of the DoD’s rare earth magnet needs. 

A race against time  

The parties involved reached an agreement on scope early on: both the government and the client were interested in protecting MP Materials’ autonomy and continued growth as a private entity.

However, there were a few hurdles to overcome. For example, the project needed to include funds and planning for the new 10X facility, but things were moving so fast that a site had not even been picked yet, creating difficulties for milestone and timeline-setting.

“This administration wanted to move as absolutely fast as possible while being extremely thorough because we all knew what we were creating was going to be precedent-setting,” said Kevin Colborne, who oversees North American Mining for the Commercial &amp; Investment Bank at J.P. Morgan. “We believe this transaction is intended as a possible blueprint for other industries and companies of national security interest.”

On the finance side, the complex deal demanded an entirely custom structure: a project-based, loan-oriented financing package with an acquisition element. “Everything was built from scratch, fit for purpose and just intense over those eight weeks. The way it came together in the end was extremely fitting for all parties, but intense to the last second,” Colborne said. 

# A template for future public-private partnerships  

***With the government looking to continue this manner of investment, Castaldo noted that the deal has positioned J.P. Morgan as an early expert in advising on and financing public-private partnerships. He said the firm will be looking to mobilize around other, similar situations in different sectors.***

***He also reflected that his biggest takeaways from the landmark deal was a sense of awe at the level of work and effort that happened behind the scenes from such a wide area of expertise — at the client, within the government and at J.P. Morgan. “A lot of people were involved,” he said. “And they were the right people.”***

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (October 1, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**) is pleased to announce that the Company took another step this week to advance its application for up to $800 million in potential debt financing to be supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (“**EXIM**” or the “**Bank**”) to advance NioCorp’s proposed critical minerals project in Southeast Nebraska (the “**Elk Creek Project**”) after executing a professional services agreement with SLR Consulting (“**SLR**”) to conduct an independent environmental and social (**“E&amp;S”**) review, an important part of EXIM’s ongoing project due diligence.

In February 2025, EXIM engaged RPMGlobal USA, Inc., which was subsequently purchased by SLR, to conduct an independent technical review of the Elk Creek Project, which is ongoing.  SLR will now conduct both the independent technical review and the E&amp;S review on behalf of the Bank.

“We are very pleased to advance the due diligence for EXIM’s review of our proposed debt financing by engaging SLR in the E&amp;S review,” said Mark A. Smith, Chairman and CEO of NioCorp.  “The SLR team is an outstanding selection and they are very familiar with our project, given the technical review work they have been conducting since February of this year.  Our team looks forward to engaging with them and EXIM as the due diligence process continues to advance.”

# ✅ Positioned at the center of the U.S. Critical Minerals strategy, NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers:

* Multiple **Top 10 USGS-listed minerals**
* Supply chain independence from China
* Vertical integration across mining, advanced processing, and **future recycling**
* Alignment with the **MCS (Multilateral Commercial Stockpile)**, **DoD offtakes**, **EXIM funding**, and the new SMR Critical Minerals Hub

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **U.S. National Security Asset**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – **The** ***quiet giant***\*\*!\*\*! From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. **Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.**
* **Titanium (Ti &amp; TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc &amp; Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $110M— funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. **(Lithium Americas latest!)**
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

Having lost her close relationship with Peter Dutton, Gina Rinehart is working to exert influence in a radically different Canberra.

By Jason Koutsoukis

9 min. readView original

Back in March, when Coalition strategists still gave themselves half a chance of winning the coming election, Gina Rinehart asked to meet Sussan Ley.

Rinehart’s bond with then Liberal leader Peter Dutton was already sealed, immortalised in a painted mural that depicts her 70th birthday, which Dutton flew across the country to attend for just 40 minutes. Now Australia’s richest woman wanted to get to know the Liberal deputy.

The meeting was arranged in Rinehart’s home town of Perth, with Ley tying the travel in with campaign events for a handful of local Liberal candidates.

“It was really just a get to know you kind of thing,” says one Coalition adviser. “Her contact with Dutton was direct, one to one, and she felt she needed to build up a rapport with Ley.”

When Dutton became leader two years earlier, he quickly fell under Rinehart’s sway, flying to Perth just days after taking the Liberal leadership and later adopting much of her policy wish list – especially on nuclear power, public service cuts and attacks on “wokeness”.

Still, the relationship with Dutton was not without strain. Rinehart made it clear during this year’s election campaign that she opposed the Coalition’s gas reservation policy, which required companies to sell into the domestic market at capped prices – a measure she regarded as anti-investment and poorly designed. As a major investor in Queensland gas producer Senex, she was also frustrated by Dutton’s refusal to abandon net zero and his caution on tax and industrial relations.

Since the election, Ley has declined to meet with Rinehart again – even on her July tour of Western Australia. That distance may soon harden into outright conflict.

As opposition leader, Ley has made it clear her ultimate goal is to meet voters where they are – widely read as code for retaining the net zero target the Coalition is currently reviewing.

One Coalition adviser says Ley sees staying committed to net zero as “essential to rebuilding Coalition support in metropolitan areas”.

Rinehart, by contrast, has made abolishing net zero a personal crusade.

In a blistering opinion piece this week in Rupert Murdoch’s metropolitan tabloids, she denounced net zero as a threat to industry and the basic functions of daily life. She branded the Paris climate accord as “living standards-destroying”.

Conjuring a future in which Australian Defence Force vehicles, ships and planes could be stranded without fuel, and ambulances, helicopters and the Royal Flying Doctor Service grounded because emissions quotas had been exceeded, her rhetoric was pure climate war.

The “net zero cult”, Rinehart wrote, would leave hospitals without doctors, farmers bankrupt and households forced to choose “between eat or heat”.

For Rinehart, compliance with net zero represents wasted money and the sacrifice of shareholder value. For Ley, it is political reality – the price of remaining electable.

“Gina is not a big fan of the Liberal Party at the moment,” one person familiar with her thinking tells *The Saturday Paper*. “There’s people within the Liberal Party she trusts, no question, but there are also Liberal Party people that she simply will not have a bar of.”

Inside the Coalition, the net zero gap is widening. Hard-right figures such as Barnaby Joyce, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Alex Antic, as well as campaign groups such as Advance, are pressing for a retreat from net zero, emboldened by Rinehart’s stance.

Ley, mindful of the electoral map and the May 3 election rout, is resisting. She knows walking away from climate commitments would play straight into Labor’s hands.

The division illustrates how Rinehart works in Canberra. She is a significant donor – $500,000 to the Coalition in the 2023–24 financial year alone – and uses direct contact with Coalition figures to push her policy agenda. Although the relationship with Ley is not as strong as it was with Dutton, she still has connections with various senior party members.

For most Labor MPs, that’s all upside. They believe Australians are with them on climate policy, on renewables, even on social inclusion. Whenever they hear Rinehart denouncing net zero as a “cult”, caucus members smile. To them, her interventions make it harder for the Coalition to capture the centre ground and easier for Labor to draw the contrast.

In that sense, the government would rather Rinehart keep talking. The louder she rails against climate action and so-called big government, the more she confirms Labor’s argument: that the Coalition is hostage to billionaires and culture warriors, while the government governs from the sensible centre.

“Gina? One of our greatest assets,” quipped one Labor backbencher from Western Australia. “Long may she reign over them!”

The more she ties herself to Donald Trump’s brand of politics, the logic goes, the easier it becomes for Labor to frame the Coalition as out of step with mainstream voters.

“It’s just very unfortunate for her that Australians have taken a very, very intense dislike to Trump,” noted another Labor source. “Every time Gina opens her mouth, she drags the Coalition further into a fight we’re happy to have.”

[After spending the United States election night at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2024/11/23/how-trumps-victory-emboldens-gina-rineharts-political-plays), one of only a few Australians present, accompanied by former Liberal Party vice-president Teena McQueen, Rinehart doubled down this week on her investment in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. She now owns 67 per cent of the company, which operates the social media platform Truth Social. The company booked a US$20 million quarterly loss and her holding is now worth about US$4.5 million.

“The consequence is that the sort of power she might be expected to wield amongst key elements of the power elite of this country isn’t what it used to be, because even they can sort of recognise the vibe,” the Labor source says. “And the vibe is against anyone who looks Trump-like, which is what she is. She’s just Trump in a dress.”

Since becoming prime minister, Anthony Albanese has never sat down with Rinehart one on one. The distance is ideological – Labor is not about to be lectured on net zero or the virtues of nuclear energy – but that doesn’t mean Rinehart’s business interests are ignored.

With Rinehart represented in Canberra by Perth-based lobbyists GRA Partners, the government takes care to keep its relationship with Rinehart and her corporate interests professional.

The approach was on display during Albanese’s visit to China in July. At a press conference following a high-profile round table with Chinese steelmakers in Shanghai, he was flanked by the heads of Australia’s iron ore majors: BHP’s Australian president, Geraldine Slattery; Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Australia, Kellie Parker; Fortescue’s executive chairman, Andrew Forrest; and Gerhard Veldsman, chief executive of Hancock Iron Ore.

Albanese praised the presence of all four, calling it a sign of “how significant the relationship is between Australian businesses and Chinese businesses and, in particular, the importance of Australian iron ore exports for steel production here in China”.

Veldsman, in turn, publicly thanked the prime minister for bringing Hancock to the table. “Today was really a fantastic step forward, and I want to thank the prime minister for getting us all together,” he said, stressing Hancock’s role as the smallest of the majors and its pride in serving Chinese and Asian customers over the past decade.

The optics were clear: while Rinehart has not sought a private audience with Albanese, her companies have a reserved seat under his imprimatur. Rinehart’s companies also enjoy a productive relationship with the federal resources minister, Madeleine King.

It is a neat division. As a political actor, Rinehart is kept at arms-length – no private audiences, no privileged channel to the prime minister or the kind of closeness she enjoyed with Peter Dutton. As a business owner, however, her company is treated like any other major player in the resources sector.

When Labor was last in power, under Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard from 2007 to 2013, the relationship was very different. Wayne Swan, as treasurer, went to war with Rinehart over the mining tax, casting her as the emblem of an industry unwilling to share the nation’s resources with the people who owned them.

In his 2014 memoir, *The Good Fight*, Swan recalls the “hypocrisy and moral obscenity” of the 2010 “billionaires’ rally” in Perth, where Rinehart, decked out in her trademark pearls, stood alongside Andrew Forrest to denounce the resource super profits tax.

For Swan, whose memories are laced with disbelief at the power the miners wielded, it was a display of sheer greed: the richest Australians demanding special treatment while ordinary taxpayers carried the load.

The industry’s campaign, he writes, was “coordinated in military style – full of fear and threats about mine closures”. It was reinforced by a media barrage that elevated sympathetic columnists while drowning out Treasury officials and Nobel laureates.

The mining companies, Swan recalled, never grasped the democratic fact that Australians owned the resources being dug from the ground. Yet under their pressure, the government was forced to retreat, redesigning the tax in 2010 and ultimately dismantling it altogether.

What stuck with Swan was less the policy defeat than the corrosion it revealed: a public discourse in which billionaires could dominate with “calculated disinformation”, while politicians were left to fend off accusations of “class warfare”.

About a year later, Swan agreed to what he believed would be a routine courtesy visit from Rinehart in his Brisbane electorate office, a catch-up he thought was long overdue after years of acrimony. Instead, he found himself ambushed.

Rinehart, he writes, turned the supposed one on one into a full-blown lobbying offensive, arriving with a phalanx of advisers and foreign investors pressing for tax relief.

“When she arrived I was surprised at the size of her entourage. What I thought was going to be a low key one-on-one turned into a large meeting with several important and serious foreign investors in tow,” Swan recalls. “As it turned out, it was far from a courtesy call, with serious propositions for tax relief put on the table. It seemed the inappropriateness of this had not occurred to her at all.”

There is a stark difference between this episode and the images of a Labor prime minister in Shanghai thanking Hancock Iron Ore’s chief executive for standing alongside him in talks with Chinese steelmakers. The hostility Swan describes has given way to something closer to accommodation – an acknowledgement that Rinehart and her companies are now firm fixtures in the architecture of Australia’s global trade diplomacy.

For all the caricature of Rinehart as a culture warrior or out-of-touch billionaire, those who have worked closely with her stress a more complicated reality.

Her politics lean hard to the right, especially on economics, but she has never been a straightforward ideologue. What drives her, they say, is the deal: a relentless focus on outcomes, blunt in delivery but rarely hostile, rooted in a record of success in a sector that once dismissed her as certain to fail.

That history still shapes how she is viewed in Canberra. Some MPs scoff at her adoration of Trump and her climate broadsides, but few forget she built Hancock Prospecting from a near-bankrupt inheritance into a debt-free juggernaut.

It leaves a paradox at the heart of her political influence. For the Coalition, she is a source of money and momentum but also a reminder to voters of the party’s dependence on billionaire benefactors. For Labor, she is both foil and fixture: a convenient opponent on climate but also a business leader too embedded in the nation’s economic story to ignore.

As Rinehart presses her campaign against net zero while doubling down on her Trump investments, the question for both sides of politics is no longer whether she matters but rather how much longer they can afford to let her set the terms of the debate.

If she succeeds, she won’t just be shaping the Coalition’s platform – she’ll be pulling the centre of Australian politics further to the right than it has been in a generation.

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\*

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

The company has begun work on a 1,500-tonne-per-year facility in Sartell, Minnesota, which it says will be capable of meeting around 3% of U.S. domestic magnet demand when operational in early 2027. Global demand for magnets is projected to surpass supply by some 55,000 tonnes by 2030. 

“Permanent magnets are in every device that powers the modern world,” Mark Champine, who heads Stellantis’ North America technical center, [said](https://www.ft.com/content/f0e37601-a15c-40d2-a241-aa835b686cf6). “Niron is meeting an urgent demand.”

# Beijing dominates the rare earths market 

Magnets are indispensable in modern technologies, embedded in everything from smartphones and wind turbines to electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. Until now, most high-performance magnets have relied on rare-earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. These minerals are geologically scarce, difficult to refine, and largely controlled by China.

Beijing dominates every stage of the rare-earth supply chain, from mining to processing to magnet production. This market dominance has long been a source of concern for Washington and U.S. industries, especially as geopolitical tensions with China rise. The Japanese company Hitachi has a presence in the field, but Chinese producers overwhelmingly lead the market.

To counter this imbalance, [Cryptopolitan reported](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-government-rare-earth-china-comparison/) that the Trump administration invested heavily in the Mountain Pass mine in California through MP Materials, effectively making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. But building mines and processing facilities is slow, capital-intensive, and environmentally fraught.

But with Niron’s approach of avoiding using rare earths entirely, the company claims it can deliver a cheaper, cleaner, and geopolitically safer magnet. 

“Western rare earth companies are playing the Chinese at the same game,” said Jonathan Rowntree, Niron’s chief executive. “We don’t need to bring a mine online.”

John Ormerod, a rare earths consultant at JOC LLC, preached caution. 

“This is a holy grail kind of magnet, since iron and nitrogen are plentiful and low cost,” he said. “But we don’t have any data from Niron, which is frustrating and makes it impossible to make a hundred per cent accurate assessment.”

Despite the unanswered questions, Niron has attracted heavyweight backing. In addition to Stellantis and GM, its investors include Volvo Cars, Samsung’s venture arm, and other major industrial players. The company has raised about $150M in private funding and secured significant government support in the form of a $52.2M tax credit earlier this year, along with $17.5M in grants from the Department of Energy’s research arm in 2022.

Experts say financing is important for Niron as the company will eventually have to prove its technology in demanding fields such as electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy.

“The magnet market covers everything from consumer electronics to military hardware,” Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, stated. “The smaller end consumer market will probably be first, but since the US has such a large magnet supply deficit, there’s no reason to not try.”

# SEPT. 27th, 2025~Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths

*New U.S. mining projects, executive orders, and defense-backed investments aim to counter Beijing’s market dominance.*

[Trump Administration Moves to Break China’s Grip on Rare Earths – \[your\]NEWS](https://yournews.com/2025/09/27/3976976/trump-administration-moves-to-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/)

https://preview.redd.it/6w2iyl7qxorf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52afc5fdf009069ed264efefb7c935d7418aa653

President Donald Trump’s administration is accelerating efforts to reduce America’s reliance on China for rare earth elements and other critical minerals, a dependency that U.S. officials and industry leaders call an existential threat. The push combines domestic mining incentives, expedited permitting, deep-sea exploration, and defense-backed market guarantees designed to outmaneuver Chinese state-subsidized control of global supply chains, according to an in depth [report by The Epoch Times](https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/how-trump-admin-is-breaking-the-ccps-hold-on-rare-earths-5908257?ea_src=frontpage&amp;ea_med=section-1).

On July 11, 2025, Ramaco Resources is slated to begin extracting more than 450 tons of rare earths from its 4,500-acre Brook Mine in Wyoming. This marks one of several new U.S. projects launched after Trump’s return to office, framed as the next phase of a decades-long struggle to revive American mining and refining. The [National Materials and Minerals Policy Act of 1980](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10930/pdf/COMPS-10930.pdf) originally set the priority, but U.S. manufacturers have grown increasingly dependent on imports, particularly from China, as documented by the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/mineral-commodity-summaries-2025).

**China’s dominance became apparent in the 2010 “rare earths crisis” and has deepened through successive export restrictions, most recently in April when Beijing added seven minerals—including dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium—to its embargo list. Today, the United States is fully import-reliant on 30 minerals where China controls at least 75 percent of global refining, according to** [**Exiger**](https://www.exiger.com/perspectives/critical-minerals-weaponization-periodic-table/)**, a supply chain risk firm working with the Pentagon.**

“The reality is, this is no longer a hypothetical risk. It’s a real, quantifiable supply chain chokepoint right now,” said Derek Lemke, Exiger’s senior vice president. “We’re seeing the weaponization of the periodic table.”

Trump has responded with a series of executive actions. His 2017 [critical minerals order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27899/a-federal-strategy-to-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-of-critical-minerals) directed agencies to define and secure resources essential to national defense. A 2020 [follow-up order](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/10/05/2020-22064/addressing-the-threat-to-the-domestic-supply-chain-from-reliance-on-critical-minerals-from-foreign) declared a national emergency over U.S. dependence on foreign adversaries, particularly China. After his 2024 reelection, Trump issued the “Unleashing American Energy” directive, followed by a March [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/) that opened more federal lands and invoked the Defense Production Act. In April, he signed an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/unleashing-americas-offshore-critical-minerals-and-resources/) to initiate deep-sea mining on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.

These steps align with funding streams set in motion by earlier laws, including the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 2022 CHIPS &amp; Science Act. The Department of Energy has since announced [major awards](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-actions-secure-american-critical-minerals-and-materials-supply), including $50 million for new processing technologies, $250 million for byproduct recovery, and $500 million for mineral projects, plus $36 million to extract critical minerals from industrial wastewater.

Industry and government are now working in tandem through initiatives like the [Critical Minerals Forum](https://cmforum.org/), founded in 2024 with DARPA backing. Apple, MP Materials, and more than 30 other companies have joined to develop U.S.-allied refining capacity. In Texas, MP Materials, with $400 million from the Department of Defense, has [opened](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Announces-Transformational-Public-Private-Partnership-with-the-Department-of-Defense-to-Accelerate-U-S--Rare-Earth-Magnet-Independence/default.aspx) a second processing plant to bolster rare earth magnet independence.

Still, experts caution that challenges remain. “The U.S. isn’t short of resources; it’s short of refining, recycling, and permitting speed. That’s where the race will be won or lost,” said Avadh Nagaralawala, an Arizona-based mining automation consultant.

Steve Christensen of the Responsible Battery Coalition said Trump has given the issue unprecedented focus. “The president understands this issue, I think, probably better than any president in recent history,” he said.

Lemke, while noting China’s advantage, said the momentum is shifting. “The quickest way to spin up this industry is to get the large players together, quantify their need, and make the direct investments. … It’s an existential challenge few Americans understand,” he said.

For Trump’s administration, the objective is clear: rebuild the domestic mineral base, diversify global partnerships, and ensure that American industries are no longer vulnerable to CCP market control.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# RECAP of ""The real signals &amp; Bombshell"" that came out of Mark’s Wainwright talk:

[MUST WATCH EVENT @@!! IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE SO..](https://preview.redd.it/7tkppcfayorf1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32dc707ae4e6b6fddc4974e6729fefca2d36a372)

# 🛑 1. Titanium

* **Confirmed:** talks with *three* U.S. majors. That’s the supply chain gap (aerospace, defense coatings, alloys).
* **Read-through:** Niocorp is positioning itself as a domestic TiCl₄/TiO₂ anchor, and that’s squarely in the **DoD/DOE wheelhouse**. A major U.S. titanium producer (think **TIMET/ATI** or even **Chemours** for TiCl₄) could lock in here.

# 🛑 2. Rare Earths / Stellantis

* **Stellantis drama** → slowed by management reshuffles, but “back on track.”
* **Read-through:** Stellantis is *still live*. They want *all* REEs. If the DFS proves scale and recovery, Stellantis could come in with a **multi-metal anchor offtake.**

# 🛑 3. Scandium Metal Demonstration

* DoD involved → using two different methods to produce scandium metal.
* NanoScale-like tech strongly suggests collaboration with Ames Lab / Nanoscale Powders type pathways.
* First Metal Nov 2025. That’s basically a demo milestone that could trigger direct DoD procurement &amp; validation.
* 🚨 Game-changer alert for Niocorp 🚨 \~BELOW\~

# 🛑 4. ScAl Alloy + Gen VI Fighters (**🔥 HUGE)

* Direct quote: Working with a DoD prime contractor on Sc-Al alloy integration.
* Gen VI fighter → 360° view, doubled threat detection, range boost.
* This is an operational security tell — ScAl alloys are already in classified development pathways for NGAD (Next Gen Air Dominance).

# ****Mark teased a partnership soon. That’s your strategic bombshell!!!!

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti &amp; TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc &amp; Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

**FOLLOWING UP ON A $50 MILLION DOLLAR RAISE**

# ON SEPT. 26th, 2025 NioCorp Announces Pricing of $60.0 Million Public Offering of Common Shares (That Closes @ Monday, Sept. 29th, 2025)

[NioCorp Announces Pricing of $60.0 Million Public Offering of Common Shares | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-pricing-of-60-0-million-public-offering-of-common-shares/)

https://preview.redd.it/r3uln72eyorf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78cb822ed5c5abb01174d8d82164afe0bdbce341

ENTENNIAL, Colo. (September 26, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**) today announced the pricing of its previously announced public offering in the United States (the “**Offering**”). **The Offering is expected to consist of up to 9,760,000 common shares (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) at a public offering price of $6.15 per common share (or $6.1499 per pre-funded warrant), for gross proceeds that are expected to be approximately $60.0 million before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses.**

Maxim Group LLC is acting as sole placement agent for the Offering.

NioCorp currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including to advance its efforts to launch construction of the Elk Creek Project and move it to commercial operation. The Offering is expected to close on or about September 29, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The Offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-280176), previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 13, 2024 and subsequently declared effective by the SEC on June 27, 2024. NioCorp may offer and sell securities in both the United States and other jurisdictions outside of Canada. No securities will be offered or sold to Canadian purchasers under the Offering.

# WITH RECENT $50M &amp; $60M RAISES IN HAND NIOCORP'S PATH FORWARD CATALYSTS ARE STACKED!

# NioCorp Ignition Sequence: Catalysts

* **Scandium Price Floor Set:** Pentagon’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto (\~$6,250/kg) validates scandium’s defense role. Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to deliver at scale.
* **Capital Stockpiled:** $50M raise completed, plus $60M offering closing Sept. 29th — funding momentum into Q4.
* **Government Tailwinds:** Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC windows, and potential U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms.
* **Stacked Catalysts Ahead:** Munich conference, October drill results, scandium-alloy announcements, offtakes, updated DFS, and EXIM FID.
* **Strategic Convergence:** Niobium, scandium, titanium, and REEs — Elk Creek represents U.S. resource independence at scale.

**IMHO- The chessboard for critical minerals just shifted.** Reuters confirmed the Defense Logistics Agency’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto at a \~$6,250/kg floor **— a de facto price signal that scandium is now locked into defense supply chains.** Yet Rio’s volumes are limited, leaving NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project as the only U.S. source positioned to deliver scandium at scale. **Mark Smith’s hints at scandium-aluminum alloy partnerships with defense primes only heighten the relevance, as the Pentagon pivots to future alloys for next-generation jets and systems.**

**Against that backdrop, NioCorp has raised $50M and followed immediately with a fresh $60M offering closing Monday, September 29th.** These aren’t signs of weakness but ammunition — capital stockpiled right as macro forces align: Pentagon stockpiling, EXIM/DFC funding windows, and even reports of direct U.S. equity stakes in strategic mineral firms. Thacker Pass lithium is already under review; niobium, scandium, and titanium are just as indispensable. Federal ownership would be the ultimate de-risking signal, a catalyst that could accelerate both financing and market credibility.

**That leaves Q4 loaded:** Munich conference visibility, October drill results with potential to re-rate the entire deposit, scandium and alloy announcements, off-take agreements across multiple products, and the updated DFS. Add in an EXIM/DFC final investment decision, Great Britain collaboration, and a 2029 production horizon, and Elk Creek stands at the intersection of government strategy and market demand. **This isn’t just a mine — it’s a U.S. resource independence play, with catalysts stacked and ignition sequence armed.**

**Key Points**

* **The Pentagon’s equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials has investors wondering where the Trump administration might invest next.**
* **The federal government needs to invest in additional miners to diversify the rare-earth supply chain, Energy Fuels CEO Mark Chalmers said.**
* **The MP deal could serve as a blueprint for interventions in other critical mineral markets like lithium, executives, analysts and lobbyists say.**

The Trump administration needs to strike multiple deals with U.S. miners to secure the nation’s supply chain against China, said Mark Chalmers, CEO of [Energy Fuels](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UUUU/), a miner focused on uranium and rare earth minerals.

The Pentagon decision to take an [equity stake](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html) in [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/), the largest U.S. rare earth miner, in July and support the company with a price floor surprised many in the industry, Chalmers told CNBC.

But it was a necessary step that the White House should now follow with more deals to diversify the U.S. supply chain and reduce the risk that would come with backing a single national champion, the CEO said.

“One company doesn’t fix it,” Chalmers said of the MP Materials deal. “You have to have multiple deals to ensure that you don’t just have the company risk, because all companies aren’t going to deliver.”

The White House is “not ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn’t mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal,” a Trump administration official told CNBC.

Rare earths are key inputs in weapons platforms such as the F-35 warplane as well as consumer products like electric vehicles and smartphones. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf). 

China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said.

“We’ve seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market — and something needed to give,” Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC.

# Possible rare earth targets

Energy Fuels’ stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. **Critical mineral miner** [**NioCorp Developments**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NB-CA/) **is also up almost 200%**, [Ramaco Resources](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/METC/) has gained 140%, and [USA Rare Earth](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) is up more than 70%.

MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said.

Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said.

Energy Fuels is focused on “providing a product that is attractive to the U.S government” and complements the strengths of MP Materials, the CEO said.

“The government cannot bet on one horse — it just doesn’t make sense,” Chalmers said. “We spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy,” he said.

# Trump eyes lithium

Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications.

The Trump administration has [proposed an equity stake ](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/lithium-americas-lac-equity-stake-trump-stock.html)in [Lithium Americas](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/), as the Canadian company renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada. The mine is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America, with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027.

Lithium Americas stock surged more than 90% this week on news of the potential government stake.

[Albemarle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALB/) CEO Kent Masters told CNBC that something “in the ballpark” of the MP deal could apply to the lithium sector. Albemarle, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest lithium producers in the world.

“What you want to do is move the market such that private industry can invest behind it,” Masters told CNBC in July, pointing to [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/)’s [offtake agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/apple-mp-materials-magnets-rare-earths.html) with MP just days after the Defense Department deal.

# Scandium Canada pushes forward with patented aluminium-scandium alloys for 3D printing

[Scandium Canada pushes forward with patented aluminium-scandium alloys for 3D printing](https://www.alcircle.com/news/scandium-canada-pushes-forward-with-patented-aluminium-scandium-alloys-for-3d-printing-115654)

https://preview.redd.it/hai1hndq83sf1.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e2572e9bfee37f795ace1dd29263f3ad4d2b9c1

Scandium Canada Ltd, an advanced materials company focused on scandium alloys, has reported new data showing that its scandium-modified AA535 and AA7075 alloys deliver an economically viable technological advancement in the field of aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) alloys for additive manufacturing. The findings, based on laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) printed samples, demonstrate that the alloys significantly reduce cracking in high-strength aluminium – a major barrier in metal 3D printing.

The company highlighted that these alloys unlock a path towards lightweight, high-performance, and cost-effective components for aerospace, automotive, and advanced engineering. “Scandium Canada’s proprietary alloys directly address the critical need for printable, high-strength, and lightweight metals in sectors such as aerospace, automotive, and advanced manufacturing,” said Dr Luc Duchesne, Head of Scandium+ and Chief Science Officer.

**Strengthening intellectual property portfolio**

This breakthrough builds on a provisional patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in September 2024 for alloy powders tailored to additive manufacturing. The patent “Aluminium[ Alloy Powders for Additive Manufacturing](https://www.alcircle.com/news/innovative-aluminium-scandium-alloys-for-3d-printing-scandium-canada-ltd-moves-forward-with-patent-112054?srsltid=AfmBOopLRION65yjbmSDdhEBMt028BJXwx7S40SqAW_ZS1j0j-J3VgPe): Methods of Producing the Same and Uses Thereof” marked an earlier milestone in Scandium Canada’s IP expansion.

[a pinch of Scandium makes stuff ...\\""Better!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1ntff42/video/d818dn9cb3sf1/player)

More recently, on 17 September 2025, the company secured an international patent application under the PCT, strengthening its protection and commercial readiness. Both steps underline a long-term strategy of building a competitive edge in high-value materials.

**Scandium+ commercialisation drive**

The company has also established Scandium+, a dedicated division to accelerate market adoption. Its goals include deploying scandium where demand is strongest and advancing alloys such as AA7075/Sc/Zr and AA535/Sc/Zr/Ce. Notably, the alloys reduce scandium requirements without compromising strength, improving sustainability and lowering costs – crucial for scaling 3D printing applications.

Mechanical tests show tensile strengths of 330–380 MPa in the as-built state, rising by up to 25 per cent after heat treatment, achieving relative densities above 99%, indicating excellent print quality and industrial reliability.

With a study under way with Productique Quebec to identify near-term commercial opportunities across more than 140 potential applications, Scandium Canada is positioning itself as a front-runner in advanced alloys. Its work with McMaster University reinforces Canada’s reputation in materials innovation.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

**IMHO —** The U.S. critical minerals chessboard is shifting fast. **Titanium in the 1950s became mainstream only after government intervention, and we’re seeing a similar playbook today across multiple strategic metals.** The Pentagon’s scandium buy from Rio Tinto may have lit the spark, but Elk Creek’s value proposition runs far deeper: niobium for high-strength steels and hypersonics, titanium &amp; TiCl₄ for jets and armor, scandium for alloys, and REEs as the vertical integration lever. **NioCorp is uniquely positioned as the** ***only U.S. project capable of delivering all four in one package***\*\*.\*\*

The upcoming **October drill results** could be the most important near-term catalyst, with real potential to re-rate the entire deposit — especially if TREO tonnage scales toward the 1,000,000t mark. That data feeds directly into the **Q4 DFS update**, which will finalize capex, opex, NPV, the RailVeyor plan, and lock in proven &amp; probable reserves. **This is when the market, lenders, and offtake partners recalibrate their models — a rerating event in every sense!**

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\*

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

NioCorp Developments Ltd. (NASDAQ:NB) is a North American critical minerals company focused on advancing one of the most strategically important mining projects in the United States. Headquartered in Centennial, Colorado, the company is developing the Elk Creek Project in southeast Nebraska, a fully permitted underground mine with the potential to become a leading domestic source of niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earth elements. These critical materials are essential to clean energy technologies, aerospace and defense applications, and advanced manufacturing, making NioCorp a pivotal player in strengthening supply chain security for the U.S. and its allies.

The company’s roots trace back to its vision of reducing America’s dependence on foreign imports of strategic minerals. With the Elk Creek Project, NioCorp is positioned to deliver multiple products from a single site, offering a diversified revenue model across high-demand sectors. Niobium, a key focus of the project, is used to produce High Strength, Low Alloy steel, which is stronger and lighter than conventional steel and critical to automotive, infrastructure, and pipeline industries. Scandium, another major output, is combined with aluminum to form alloys that improve strength, reduce weight, and enhance corrosion resistance, while also being a vital component of solid oxide fuel cells. Titanium is widely used in aerospace, medical implants, and pigments for paper, plastics, and paints, further broadening the project’s commercial reach. In addition, NioCorp is assessing its capacity to produce magnetic rare earth elements, including neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium, which are indispensable for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced defense technologies.

A significant differentiator for NioCorp is its advanced permitting status. Unlike many junior mining companies that struggle with regulatory hurdles, the Elk Creek Project has already secured all major permits required for construction and operation. This achievement dramatically reduces development risk and shortens the timeline to production. NioCorp has also signed binding offtake agreements that cover roughly 75 percent of its planned niobium output, in addition to securing the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, offering long-term market validation for its products. These agreements ensure that the company has secured customers well before entering production, providing a level of commercial certainty rare in the development stage of mining projects.

The Elk Creek Project is further strengthened by strong support from local, state, and federal stakeholders. The U.S. Department of Defense has awarded funding to NioCorp in recognition of the project’s importance to national security, and the company has applied for $800 million in debt financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank. These government partnerships highlight the strategic role NioCorp plays in advancing America’s critical minerals independence, especially as global geopolitical tensions increase concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities.

Led by Chairman, President, and CEO Mark Smith, NioCorp’s management team brings decades of experience in mining, engineering, and rare earth development. Under this leadership, the company has advanced the Elk Creek Project from exploration to a fully permitted, development-ready project with robust economics and a projected 38-year mine life. The combination of technical expertise, financial discipline, and industry relationships positions NioCorp as one of the most credible companies in the critical minerals sector.

With global demand for clean energy, advanced alloys, and rare earth magnets accelerating, NioCorp Developments Ltd. stands at the forefront of a new era in mining and materials. Its Elk Creek Project is poised not only to generate long-term shareholder value but also to become a cornerstone in rebuilding domestic supply chains for minerals that are fundamental to modern technology and national security.

# National Spotlight Through Bloomberg TV and RedChip

NioCorp Developments Ltd. has recently been thrust into the national spotlight with its feature on the RedChip Small Stocks Big Money™ show airing on Bloomberg TV. With Bloomberg reaching an estimated 73 million households across the United States, this appearance represents a significant opportunity for NioCorp to share its story directly with a broad investor audience. Mark Smith, Chairman, President, and CEO of NioCorp, used this platform to discuss the company’s Elk Creek Project in Nebraska, a fully permitted $1.14 billion underground critical minerals mine. This project is one of the most advanced and strategically important initiatives in the North American mining sector, designed to supply metals essential to clean energy, aerospace, automotive, and defense industries. The media coverage not only validates NioCorp’s position in the market but also provides a catalyst for increasing awareness among retail and institutional investors.

# Elk Creek: A Strategic U.S. Critical Minerals Project

The Elk Creek Project is the cornerstone of NioCorp’s bullish outlook. Located in Southeast Nebraska, this fully permitted mine is projected to produce niobium, scandium, titanium, and potentially rare earth oxides that are indispensable to modern technology and national security. Unlike many other junior mining companies that remain stuck in permitting phases or struggle with regulatory hurdles, NioCorp has already secured all major permits required to advance construction. This is a crucial advantage, as it significantly de-risks the project and shortens the timeline to production.

What sets Elk Creek apart is its potential to establish the first true mine-to-market scandium supply chain in the United States. Scandium, though relatively obscure, is a powerful enabler in advanced materials, used in aluminum alloys to create stronger and lighter products. It is also critical in next-generation solid oxide fuel cells, giving it growing relevance in the clean energy economy. By securing the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, NioCorp has validated both the demand and commercial viability of its output, positioning itself as a pioneer in this niche but vital market.

# Binding Offtake Agreements and Market Validation

NioCorp has secured offtake agreements covering approximately 75 percent of its planned niobium output, a clear signal that industrial buyers are eager to lock in supply from the project. Niobium is essential for producing High Strength, Low Alloy (HSLA) steel, a lighter and stronger form of steel used across automotive, construction, and pipeline industries. With global infrastructure and electric vehicle production expanding, demand for niobium is expected to rise steadily.

Beyond niobium, NioCorp’s scandium offtake agreement represents another milestone. It is the largest scandium sales contract ever signed, underscoring the company’s ability to commercialize its resources effectively. Together, these agreements reduce marketing risk and provide investors with confidence that revenue streams are already secured even before the mine begins full-scale operations. This kind of market validation is rare among junior developers and strengthens the bullish thesis considerably.

# Robust Economics, Long Mine Life, and Government Support

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is backed by robust economics, including a projected 38-year mine life that ensures decades of potential revenue generation. Long-life assets with diversified metal output are highly attractive in the mining sector, as they provide resilience against commodity price cycles. Furthermore, the company is leveraging strong support from state, local, and federal stakeholders, which further enhances its execution prospects.

The U.S. Department of Defense has already recognized the strategic value of NioCorp’s project by awarding grants, while the company has also applied for an $800 million loan with the U.S. Export-Import Bank to finance construction. Such endorsements highlight how central NioCorp’s project is to U.S. national interests, particularly in reducing dependence on foreign sources for critical minerals. With growing geopolitical tensions and concerns about resource security, companies like NioCorp are strategically positioned to benefit from government initiatives and subsidies aimed at reshoring supply chains.

# A Management Team With Proven Expertise

Leadership is another important factor in building investor confidence, and NioCorp’s management team brings decades of experience in mining, rare earth development, and critical minerals. Under Mark Smith’s guidance, the company has advanced from exploration into a fully permitted development-stage project with offtake agreements in place. Smith and his team’s track record of navigating regulatory processes, securing partnerships, and engaging with investors gives credibility to the company’s ability to execute its ambitious plans.

# Expanding Into Rare Earth Oxides

In addition to niobium, scandium, and titanium, NioCorp is also evaluating the production of magnetic rare earth elements such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium, and dysprosium. These elements are critical in the production of neodymium-iron-boron magnets, which are indispensable in electric vehicle motors, renewable energy technologies, and advanced defense systems. As global demand for these magnets continues to climb, Elk Creek’s potential rare earth output adds another layer of upside to NioCorp’s already robust project.

# Why the Bullish Thesis Holds

The bullish thesis for NioCorp Developments Ltd. rests on several pillars: a fully permitted and shovel-ready $1.14 billion critical minerals project, binding offtake agreements covering the majority of its output, government recognition and support, and a unique position to deliver scandium and rare earths to markets that are desperate for secure supply. With a projected 38-year mine life, the economics are compelling, while strong leadership and execution capacity further increase confidence in the company’s long-term potential.

As the U.S. and its allies race to secure supply chains for critical minerals vital to clean energy, aerospace, automotive, and defense industries, NioCorp stands at the center of this strategic push. The Elk Creek Project is more than a mining operation—it is a national security asset, a clean energy enabler, and a potential cash flow powerhouse. For investors seeking exposure to the critical minerals megatrend, NioCorp offers a unique, de-risked, and government-backed opportunity to capture long-term growth.

[ The move is the latest example of the Trump administration seeking direct government ownership in Nevada’s critical minerals industry as the administration looks to strengthen its position in both domestic production and global supply chains. \(Lithium Americas video screengrab\)](https://preview.redd.it/89owp42qfhrf1.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93f8961a9d99c175e905d9607a5209ece3690f9d)

The Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates the company’s $2.26 billion federal loan for the Thacker Pass mine project in Nevada.

Reuters [reported on Tuesday](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-administration-seeks-equity-stake-lithium-americas-amid-loan-talks-2025-09-23/) the White House is requesting as much as a 10% stake in the Canada-based mining company in exchange for a modification to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) loan. 

Thacker Pass, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border, is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America once operational. The project is a joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors.

Lithium Americas [confirmed on Wednesday](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2025/Lithium-Americas-Comments-on-Share-Price-Movement/default.aspx) it was in discussions with the DOE and General Motors over the Thacker Pass loan, adding the company is working towards “a mutually agreeable resolution.”

Tim Crowley, vice president of government and external affairs for Lithium Americas, said in an email Wednesday that the company cannot comment on the details of its discussions with the DOE and General Motors, but expects “to provide an update in the future.”

The negotiations revolved around a modification sought by Lithium Americas and General Motors that would allow a longer repayment period for the loan after Lithium Americas missed conditions necessary for the first disbursement.

“In exchange for their minor modification, our minor modification was essentially for the administration to have some equity in the deal to create a cash buffer and eliminate some risk for taxpayers … we want some equity on behalf of taxpayers,” a [White House official told Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/white-house-lithium-americas-finance-deal).

While Lithium Americas has offered to provide the U.S. government an equity stake in exchange for the loan, General Motors is proving to be a tougher sell, [according to ](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/white-house-lithium-americas-finance-deal)Reuters.  

General Motors [invested $650 million](https://nevadacurrent.com/briefs/gm-commits-650m-to-develop-nevada-lithium-mine-tangled-in-federal-lawsuit/) in the mine, securing a 38% stake in the project. Under the agreement, the car company has the right to buy during the first stage of lithium production — but not an obligation to do so — which became a sticking point for the White House.

According to the Reuters report, the White House is now asking General Motors to commit to purchasing the mine’s lithium. The report said Trump officials are also asking General Motors to give up control over some parts of the project. 

The White House said the request for an equity position was driven by concerns Lithium Americas would struggle to repay the loan given low lithium carbonate prices created by softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.

The price of lithium carbonate has fallen more than 80% since its peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/lithium) said the price fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts do not expect lithium prices to rally significantly any time soon.

The Trump administration’s interest in an equity position with Lithium Americas seemed to be well received by investors. Lithium Americas’ stock price more than doubled at one point following the reports of the U.S. stake.

The move is the latest example of the Trump administration seeking direct government ownership in Nevada’s critical minerals industry as the administration looks to strengthen its position in both domestic production and global supply chains.

The Department of Defense took a[ 15% equity stake](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in Las Vegas-based rare earth miner MP Materials in July, making the federal government the largest shareholder in the company. 

Nevada officials have said they expect more investment from the federal government in the state’s mineral supply chain, especially from the DOE and the Department of Defense.

“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during [a lithium summit last week](https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/09/22/despite-minerals-price-slump-nevada-still-set-up-for-a-lithium-boom-officials-say/).

“I think you’ll see that in Nevada,” Burns said.

The Trump administration has sought a government stake in other critical mineral and semiconductor companies. In June, the Trump administration [approved US Steel’s takeover](https://www.ussteel.com/newsroom/-/blogs/nippon-steel-corporation-and-u-s-steel-finalize-historic-partnership) by Japan’s Nippon Steel in exchange for the federal government owning a majority control of the company’s shares. 

Last month, the federal government also announced it would take a [10% stake in Intel ](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to)in an effort to help boost semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. The federal government also said it would allow Nvidia and AMD to [sell their chips to China](https://apnews.com/article/nvidia-amd-15-revenue-share-deal-c06e20d9c3418f1d0b1292891c4610c6) in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenues on those sales.

* **We'll examine how potential government ownership could reshape MP Materials' investment narrative and influence its future risk profile.**

# MP Materials Investment Narrative Recap

At its core, MP Materials asks investors to believe in the durability of US rare earth supply chains, supported by long-term government and corporate offtake agreements. News of potential government equity stakes signals more active federal involvement, but does not directly alter the most important short-term catalyst: scaling up production and downstream magnet output at its new facilities. Execution risk around these expansions remains the main short-term concern, particularly as delays or overruns could weigh on earnings potential.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

**IMHO- The critical minerals chessboard just shifted again**. With Reuters confirming the Defense Logistics Agency’s $40M scandium oxide buy from Rio Tinto at a \~$6,250/kg floor, the Pentagon has now set pricing signals that validate scandium’s role in future defense alloys. But Rio is Canadian and limited — Elk Creek is the only U.S. project positioned to supply scandium at scale. **Layer in Mark Smith’s hints of Sc-Al alloy partnerships, drilling assays due in October, and a Q4 DFS with updated economics, and the roadmap for domestic scandium is tightening into a near-term reality.**

**On the heals of NioCorp's recent $50M raise and last night’s fresh offering announcement aren’t weakness — they’re ammunition!** **NioCorp is stockpiling capital exactly when the macro winds are at their back: new Pentagon stockpiling, fresh EXIM/DFC funding programs, and now reports that the Trump administration is exploring direct equity stakes in U.S. critical mineral firms.**

**That’s not hypothetical —** Thacker Pass lithium is already under review, and Niobium, Scandium, and Titanium are as strategically indispensable as lithium. **If Washington wants security of supply, NioCorp is a front-runner candidate. A U.S. stake would be the ultimate de-risking signal for investors and a force-multiplier for financing.**

Taken together, this isn’t just a “mine story” anymore — it’s a national resource independence play. Elk Creek represents the convergence of Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and Rare Earths in a single, U.S.-based complex at a moment when government, **Wall Street, and defense primes are all converging on supply security. By seizing capital now, NioCorp positions itself to meet that moment head-on. With federal dollars setting floors, catalysts stacked into Q4, and even direct ownership on the table, the ignition sequence for NioCorp just got stronger.**

Australia’s former competition tsar Graeme Samuel has called on Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers to [end multi-billion-dollar industry subsidies](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/consumers-and-businesses-facing-highcost-net-zero-future-amid-a-new-carbon-price-push/news-story/fdce894fe6cc02903007c0e31d1dd776) and tell companies seeking handouts or bailouts that “enough is enough”.

[Ahead of the Treasurer’s three-day economic reform roundtable](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/abundance-of-red-tape-and-less-tax-chat-on-jim-chalmers-roundtable-agenda/news-story/db02b2c51fc83ba63fa4a87dda1f7405) this month, which will discuss how to encourage greater competition in the market to drive productivity and investment, Professor Samuel urged the government to allow the private sector to stand on its own feet.

Professor Samuel, who was Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission chairman from 2003 to 2011 and led reviews for both Labor and the Coalition into environment law, defence controls and supermarkets, said the Albanese government must “numb the political nerve and the special pleadings that are coming from vested interests”.

The Monash University Business School academic and former National Competition Council president also cited political consideration as a motivation behind the federal and South Australian governments’ $2.4bn taxpayer-funded rescue package for the Whyalla steelworks.

Since the Prime Minister rolled out his big-spending [Future Made in Australia vehicle](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/pms-green-dream-future-is-vanishing-into-thin-air/news-story/76eddb0277653bba0867fc0f040acacf), which is underwriting investments that align with Labor’s policy agenda across clean energy, green metals, solar panels, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and rare earths, critics have accused the government of picking winners.

Amid a growing push by countries across the globe to subsidise clean energy, defence and critical minerals production, Professor Samuel told The Australian: “National security is the latest rage … it used to be about energy and climate change … and now it’s national security they’ve caught on to. I’m hoping that what’s coming out of all the roundtables, and what’s coming out of Chalmers’ statements, is that he’s really saying to industry, ‘look, enough is enough … the budget doesn’t allow for it’.

“Those making special pleadings are touching upon a political nerve, but the government is in extraordinarily fortunate, and almost unprecedented position, that the political nerve can be numbed. They should say; “we’ve got 94 seats now in the House of Representatives, we don’t need to be doing this anymore’. So my urgings to government would be to say, numb the political nerve and the special pleadings that are coming from vested interests.”

Productivity Commission chair Danielle Wood last year warned that Future Made in Australia subsidies and incentives would come at a cost and divert investment from more productive parts of the economy.

Professor Samuel endorsed Dr Chalmers’ questions of industry and other stakeholders ahead of the roundtable about “who’s going to pay” for various proposals being put to government.

The former ACCC boss said if he had any influence over the Whyalla Steelworks bailout decision he would have said “just stop”. “A lot of that is political as well,” he said. “It’s South Australia and certain seats. We had this with (former Liberal prime minister Scott) Morrison and Western Australia,” he said.

The Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund on Thursday announced a $50m equity investment stake in the Gina Rinehart-backed Liontown Resources to support lithium production at the company’s Kathleen Valley operation in Western Australia.

As Dr Chalmers continued his “boardroom blitz” on Thursday,[ Mr Albanese categorically ruled out any new tax changes](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/actu-calls-for-25bn-in-fair-tax-redistribution-of-productivity-gains/news-story/ae7091d20008cc7bf47292d5386f9275) during his second-term of government.

Speaking in Melbourne, the Prime Minister said “governments make government policy, and … the only tax policy that we’re implementing is the one that we took to the election”, referring to reducing incomes taxes from July 1 next year.

Ahead of another round of meetings on Friday, Dr Chalmers met private sector leaders in Sydney on Thursday including BHP Australia president Geraldine Slattery, Business Council of Australia president Geoff Culbert, Wesfarmers managing director Rob Scott, Rio Tinto chief executive Kellie Parker, Mirvac chief executive Campbell Hanan, ­Google Australia managing director Mel Silva, Gilbert+Tobin chair Danny Gilbert, GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway, ­Cochlear chief executive Dig ­Howitt, AirTrunk chief executive Robin Khuda and BCA chief executive Bran Black.

The Australian understands that business leaders have been told the roundtable will not be a launching pad for sweeping tax ­reforms pushed by the unions and others. However, the government is expected to focus discussions heavily on addressing “intergenerational equity”, which will likely drive new tax policies ahead of the 2028 election.

Treasury issues papers released on Thursday – described by Dr Chalmers as “deliberately flat and factual” – outlined the ­government’s agenda for the three-day summit, to be held at Parliament House from August 19 to 21. Included in the resilience, productivity and budget sustainability and tax reform issues ­papers were references to the ­implications of the current tax ­system and public spending on productivity and “intergenerational equity”.

In the wake of Treasury’s post-election warnings to Dr Chalmers that he would need to lower spending and increase taxes to maintain a sustainable budget, the government is under pressure to pursue new tax measures and ­address concerns about negative gearing, GST, capital gains tax, company tax rates, and the need for road user charges.

Treasury’s budget sustainability and tax reform issues paper warned that the return to deficits was fuelled by higher spending and lower revenue. “The budget is forecast to continue to be in deficit over the forward estimates by an average of 1.2 per cent of GDP,” the paper said.

The seven “key structural spending pressures on the budget” were listed as interest costs growing by 9.5 per cent a year over the medium term. the NDIS, defence spending, hospital funding, Medicare, aged care, and childcare.

“The tax system is under pressure from demographic and economic shifts, and its design is critical to productivity, budget sustainability and intergenerational equity,” the issues paper said. “Structural changes to the economy, including an ageing population and the transition to net-zero, are expected to change the composition of the revenue base.

“The share of indirect taxes will fall, as the decarbonisation of the transport industry and changing consumer preferences erode the fuel and tobacco excise bases. This will increase reliance on the income tax base, which is expected to comprise an increasing share of total tax receipts.”

The Treasurer said the issues papers had been released now “so we can spend time at the roundtable on specific ideas not just problem identification”.

The Productivity Commission’s interim report on the national competition policy reforms inquiry, released on Thursday night, estimated that harmonising standards across all jurisdictions and aligning them to those that existed internationally would be worth more than $15bn over the forward estimates, or up to $3.8bn a year. The commission identified three main benefits from such a move: lower compliance costs ­incurred by businesses, lower ­administrative costs for government and the increase of products designed overseas to be sold in Australia. “Greater (product) range would imply consumer welfare gains from greater competition, lower prices and greater product diversity, productivity gains,” the report stated.

The commission said 21 mandated standards were not aligned with international standards, while a further 169 had no existing counterpart overseas. “Despite the small number of internationally unaligned standards, these standards can create trade barriers when mandated,” it said.

The commission reiterated its call for a road user charge, which Dr Chalmers has nominated as a reform priority that would help abate falling fuel excise.

AbraSilver (former Abraplata) has been in our portfolio since 18 months.

ticker  **$ABRA.v**  or  **$ABBRF**

Our buy price was 9 cents. At a certain point, my initial investment **went down 61% to 3.5 cents**. 18 months later, those who bought at the lows are up 1500%, a 15 bagger.

Back then, my due diligence and knowlegde on Juniors was not the level it is now. My main expertise is timing a Silver bull and bear market.

Abraplata had a 140M oz resource, which would be a guaranteed winner if we entered a bull market. That’s how it all begun. I didn’t know more about the company as the ounces and the valuation per ounce, back then barely 3M Mcap. This simple math is copied mostly by amateur investors. 18 months later, i know better: A **strong management team**, a **good shareholder** structure, continious deliver or **outperforming expectations** and **hard work** is what matters, combined with a bit of luck.

The question we are asking today what are the triggers for more value creation in the next 18 months after such a nice run?

At AbraSilver, **i see plenty**. Let me explain in more dept.

First, look at the recent financings, dating from summer 2020.

AbraSilver did 3 financings in very short order near the top of $30 Silver in June-August 2020: that’s something i can admire, **a great sense of timing**, avoiding dilution for shareholders.3+5+15 million, and is as such now **funded untill construction decision** (!) (18M in the bank) for: - finalising 13.000m program - phase II drilling - 2 drill rigs keep going - update of the resource (!) - PEA study - feasibility study.

Top 3 Shareholders: Eric Sprott, Altius Minerals and SSR Mining own 37% of all outstanding shares, **total insiders are at 43%**

While some might argue there are a lot of warrants out, in the case of AbraSilver it brings money in the bank here avoiding new financings. All shares are free trading and this is reflected by a huge consolidation pattern since summer 2020: a smaller cup &amp; handle inside a bigger cup &amp; handle.

Weak hands taking profits early have been shifted to strong hands.

Yes, the longterm chart looks very bullish, **a giant four year cup &amp; handle**, and we are about to take out all time highs, with no old sellers left. Whent here is **no chart resistance**, stocks can really fly after such a long base. So from a technical point of view, it looks lovely.

Now we come to the asset, which was the reason for my initial investment.

I am now talking about the old resource (not updated since 2018)

What i love about **Diablillos** (based in **Salta** Argentina, top 4 most attractive jurisdictions in Latin America) it has no base metals, and it’s a **pure Silver-Gold deposit**, the last outdated resource update shows 140Moz AgEq or in Gold 1.7Moz AuEq.

**156 g/t AgEq - very high for open pit, so cheap mining.**

**60% of the resource is comprised of silver**, providing significant leverage to rising silver price

Diabllilos average oxide grades of 2.1 g/t AuEq is **2.5x higher than comparable oxide projects** in the Americas….and expected to increase further.

Let’s talk about **the old PEA from 2018.** This is an economic study about a potential mine.

for every dollar increase in Silver or $100 in Gold, the value creation is **$60 million**

remember, that doesn’t include any of last years drill intercepts.

The 2018 study envisages an open pit with a 6000tpd plant **producing 9.8 Moz AgEq per year**

Now realize for example First Majestic, is producing 21 Moz AqEq per year.

The production at Abra would be very low-cost open pit:  **average all-in sustaining cost per ounce of US$7.52/oz AgEq**

The 2018 PEA production study is comparable to that of intermediate silver producers (avg. 12MM oz/year AgEq) that have **an average market cap of C$1.7 Billion.**

Summarized, **based on all the old information, at current Silver prices** **my target is $1.8/share.**

Now what **are triggers from the more recent drilling results** in the last 18 months?

this timeline of newsflow explains 2021 is a BIG year for AbraSilver.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anqdryh3pdn61.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=685c3cb567671055f59727b08d208a98f7d27d9c

After this drill program at Diablillos, we can expect **a new resource estimate as soon as the next quarter**.

How much the old one at 140Moz will grow, is anybody’s guess. My estimate is we could see a 20% increase on this summer update, but perhaps a lot more. And, it still remains open for further expansion. \*\*The final deposit could be closer to 250Moz, the size of San Dimas First Majestic.\*\*Or a 1+ billion valuation at current Silver prices.

With that new reource estimate, **a new PEA will be released later around mid 2021**, and a follow-up drill program, again at Diablillos. I expect all this to happen while #silver goes from 25 to $50.

**Beyond explosive isn’t it ?**

Rio Tinto drilling a join venture project with Abra at Arcas Chile is just icing on the cake. Yes, Abra owns 4 other assets and they have a join venture with Rio so expect newsflow also from that side. As most of you know: **a continous newsflow is important** to create strong hands in a share, and it's something a lot of juniors struggle at.

Summing up, $ABRA.v has a lot of rerate triggers even here at this Mcap.

Some junior investors make the mistake **selling out early** to be invested again in nanocaps all the time. Once they grow big, they bail.

The current 6-7 biggest picks in our Silver Sitfolio have the qualities of being a target for multibillion companies. **These are the kind of assets that might get valued sky high at $100 silver in a bidding war.**

Size and derisked matters. This graph shows why Abra is a very strong M&amp;A target in terms of size.

https://preview.redd.it/hmebgy9npdn61.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e48d5909415aa3e68ac2f739242edb3df4ea48

When a buyout scenario is likely, this is not the pick you want to take profits on.It can happen at any time further down the road, when the new PEA is published. This week we had 3 M&amp;A activities at a 50% premium. Now i hope it doesn't happen in the next 3 months before the big updates, it's definitely a reason to **just buy and hold.**

Notice a second reason is as an investor, i don’t get married to a position but if the value proposition stays intact, nothing gives more satisfaction than seeing your company grow from almost unknown/nothing to massive.

**It’s a lifechanging journey, and in case of Abraplata, a 100+ bagger journey.**

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

\*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.

**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.357865,2025-05-27T05:37:31,Rio Tinto,2025

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II**. Erosion of Our Freedoms**

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

The former Treasury secretary failed to have a previous Labor government implement a resources super profits tax, but he has plenty of big ideas for tax reform.

By Jennifer Hewett

5 min. readView original

It was coincidental timing that [Simon Trott’s ascension](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/rio-tinto-names-iron-ore-division-chief-simon-trott-as-next-ceo-20250715-p5mf43) from heading Rio Tinto’s iron ore division to becoming CEO overlaps with echoes of the ill-fated resource rent tax.

That came in the form of a National Press Club address by former Treasury secretary Ken Henry, whose name is still synonymous with the resource super profits tax he proposed as part of his wide-ranging review of Australia’s tax system 15 years ago.

Ken Henry at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday – he said an economy-wide carbon tax was needed and may happen eventually. AAP

Most of Henry’s other recommendations were ignored – one reason for the tax system’s inefficient, cumbersome inadequacy today.

But [Henry, now chair of the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation,](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/fix-green-laws-before-tax-to-create-growth-ken-henry-20250715-p5mf04) remains a passionate advocate for broad tax reform – including addressing the pernicious impact of high personal income tax rates on younger generations.

So a certain political resonance was felt when Jim Chalmers said he had consulted Henry on the treasurer’s big speech last month promoting Labor’s second-term economic reform ambitions, including tax.

Chalmers is familiar with the failure of the resources super profits tax, given he was a senior adviser to then treasurer Wayne Swan when the issue flared.

The bitter opposition of the West Australian government and the iron ore industry to the idea of a federal resource tax in 2010 quickly led to Labor’s beheading of Kevin Rudd as prime minister in his first term.

It’s also true that despite some ups and downs for the industry, the super profits of the massive expansion of WA’s iron ore exports and resilient prices have greatly assisted successive federal governments and their budgets ever since. Iron ore is still helping to fill much of the big budget hole created by the Albanese government’s spending, for example, as well as paying enough royalties to keep the WA government flush with cash.

Yet the Albanese government is obviously looking for more tax revenue from somewhere, given federal spending is growing at 6 per cent in real terms this financial year and national economic growth is so sluggish.

Henry has strongly promoted a carbon tax applied to Australia’s fossil fuel exports of coal and gas, for example, arguing this could raise $50 billion a year. That would agitate much of the coal and gas industry in a replay of the political furore over the resources rent tax, making it unlikely Chalmers would take the risk.

That’s even if Henry remains keen for an economy-wide carbon tax, telling the Press Club it is needed and may happen eventually.

“In the meantime we have something else and we’ve got to make the something else work, right?” he said on Wednesday.

That something else, in his strong view, includes the need to fix complex environmental regulations and laws as a priority to help improve Australia’s dismal productivity record and as a model for improving state-federal co-operation.

# Miners’ concern delays and restrictions

That’s a goal actually shared by the mining industry these days, as long as new environmental laws don’t end up worsening delays and restrictions, translating into lesser progress for the economy, as well as the environment.

Fear of just this happening led to the West Australian government persuading Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to drop plans to proceed with environmental legislation ahead of the last election.

Labor will have another go at it this term, including establishing a federal environmental agency. The mining industry will be cautiously willing to co-operate to get a difficult balance right. Henry’s suggestion at the Press Club that a climate trigger should at least be considered as part of a revised Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will keep many miners on alert.

But these days they will back his argument on the need for greater efficiency and speed in approving projects like new mines and associated infrastructure. The new regard in environmental circles for the development of critical minerals and more transmission lines for the energy transition creates common cause that once seemed improbable.

The iron ore industry’s other goals for decarbonisation should also be more closely aligned with Henry’s stance on the need for urgent action to combat climate change.

Iron ore miners are all working hard on trying to decarbonise mining operations, including extensive use of renewable energy like solar power.

Not that Andrew Forrest’s industry competitors agree with the Fortescue founder’s push for an immediate end to the diesel fuel rebate when it is proving so difficult to electrify heavy trucks and green hydrogen projects are being dumped.

Nor do they back Forrest’s bleak warnings that the Pilbara will turn into a wasteland without an urgent surge into a future of green iron – helped along by government subsidies.

# Fears over green iron production

Forrest argues that China, which sources 60 per cent of its iron ore imports from Australia, will shift to other countries with higher-grade ores unless the industry changes radically.

Trott told the Australian Financial Review Mining Summit in May that people had predicted the end of the Pilbara’s iron ore industry numerous times.

“Each time the industry has adapted and responded, and I’ve got no doubt that’s going to continue,” he said in response to Forrest.

But BHP, Rio Tinto and Hancock Iron Ore are far more sceptical about the viability of producing green iron at scale or affordable cost.

That’s even though BHP, Rio and BlueScope Steel are co-operating in the NeoSmelt project, a $215 million facility in Perth that is expected to produce up to 40,000 tonnes of low-emissions iron when it begins in 2028.

They still maintain the biggest reduction in carbon emissions from steelmaking will not come from reinventing iron ore mining but from technological advances in China’s ageing blast furnaces.

Promoting greater co-operation with the Chinese steel industry on decarbonisation worked well for the joint appearance of executives from BHP, Rio, Hancock and Fortescue alongside the prime minister in China this week. It just doesn’t fit neatly with the Albanese government’s obsession with more green metals manufacturing being done in Australia.

It’s still a reminder of how much has changed in Australia’s iron ore industry since the Henry tax review. What comes next?",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.358309,2025-07-17T06:42:42,Rio Tinto,2025

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\*

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

**1. BHP (**NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.  


**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.359014,2025-05-21T00:35:06,Rio Tinto,2025

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II**. Erosion of Our Freedoms**

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

**1. BHP (**NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.  


**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.359268,2025-05-21T00:35:27,Rio Tinto,2025

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

\*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.

**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.359376,2025-05-27T05:37:19,Rio Tinto,2025

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.359496,2025-05-27T05:37:02,Rio Tinto,2025

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

\*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.

**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

I'm quite active in the markets and have over a decade of experience, but this is my first time focusing on dividend stocks specifically. I'm looking to build a slightly more boring and defensive arm of the portfolio, specifically to protect against potential stagflation, and would appreciate any feedback. The allocations (% of this part of the portfolio) are on the right, and I grabbed the most recent Dividend Yield data from Finviz. Oh and I pay pretty close attention to technicals, so most of these are names with charts that I think look likely to head higher over the next 2 to 5 years. My plan is to review and potentially re-balance this portfolio every 6-months.

And just for reference, the broader portfolio structure is as follows:

**After spending most of 2025's first quarter consolidating at the US$63 per pound level, spot U3O8 prices have been on an upswing, adding 13.62 percent between March 30 and May 14.** 

The uptick has been supported by improving utility demand, tariff clarity and resilient supply-demand fundamentals.

While broad market uncertainty added pressure for other commodities, uranium’s long term outlook prevented the energy fuel from suffering more declines at the start of the year's second quarter.

“As other asset classes faltered, uranium held its ground, supported by its structural supply-demand story, inelastic demand and insulation from tariff-related disruptions,” Jacob White of Sprott (TSX:SII,NYSE:SII) wrote in a [recent uranium report](https://sprott.com/insights/uranium-regains-momentum/).

As tailwinds propelled the spot price higher uranium, uranium equities also caught an updraft. 

“Physical uranium and uranium equities continue to outperform over longer periods,” said White, who is the firm's exchange-traded fund product manager. “The strong five-year returns of physical uranium and uranium equities relative to broader commodity and equity benchmarks reinforce the metal’s role as a differentiated and strategic asset class.”

\*\*1. BHP (\*\*NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP)

**Market cap:** US$128.63 billion

Mining major BHP owns and operates Australia’s Olympic Dam mine, considered one of the world's largest uranium deposits. While the site is included in the company’s Copper South Australia operations portfolio and copper is the primary resource extracted, the mine also produces significant quantities of uranium, gold and silver.

In the operational review for its third fiscal quarter of 2025, released in mid-April, BHP reported a decrease in uranium production year-over-year. The company's fiscal year-to-date uranium production totaled 2,180 metric tons, an 18 percent contraction from 2,674 metric tons in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

BHP is advancing its Olympic Dam expansion plan, which includes building a two-stage smelter, with a final decision due in 2026, and the US$5 billion Northern Water project, featuring a desalination plant and 600 kilometer pipeline.

The expansion targets a copper output of 650,000 metric tons annually by the mid-2030s, doubling its current production. While it was previously expected that BHP's uranium output would expand at a similar rate, causing fear of oversupply and low prices, BHP announced in February that this would not be the case. 

Uranium production is expected to rise marginally, by roughly 1 percent. 

Additionally, if the company decides to expand the hydrometallurgical plant to process uranium in the future, growth will still be smaller than expected due to lower uranium concentrations in feedstock ore from newly integrated assets Carrapateena and Prominent Hill.

**2. Cameco** (NYSE:CCJ,TSX:CCO)

**Market cap:** US$23.2 billion

Uranium major Cameco holds significant stakes in key uranium operations within the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, Canada, including a 54.55 percent interest in Cigar Lake, the world's most productive uranium mine. 

The company also owns 70 percent of the McArthur River mine and 83 percent of the Key Lake mill. Orano Canada is Cameco's primary joint venture partner across these operations.

Cameco also holds a 40 percent interest in the Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan, with the rest held by the state company Kazatomprom. The mine produces uranium using in-situ recovery.

Weak spot uranium prices between 2012 and 2020 weighed heavily on pure-play uranium producers. In 2018, Cameco placed the McArthur River and Key Lake operations on care and maintenance, reducing the company's total annual uranium output from 23.8 million pounds in 2017 to 9.2 million pounds in 2018. 

Improving market dynamics prompted the company to restart MacArthur Lake in 2022.

As a full nuclear fuel cycle provider, Cameco, in partnership with Brookfield Renewable Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, completed the purchase of Westinghouse Electric Company — a leading provider of nuclear power plant services and technologies — in November 2023.

In its Q1 update, Cameco reported steady operational and financial performance, with consolidated adjusted EBITDA of C$353 million and adjusted net earnings of C$70 million. 

While uranium segment earnings declined due to timing of sales at its Inkai joint venture, average realized prices improved, supported by stronger fixed-price contracts and a favorable US dollar. For 2025, Cameco expects uranium production of 18 million pounds on a 100 percent basis at each of Cigar Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake.

After logistical issues at its Inkai joint venture in Kazakhstan weighed on production growth in 2024, Inkai suspended operations for about three weeks in January due to a directive from partner Kazatomprom. The revised 2025 production target is 8.3 million pounds on a 100 percent basis, with Cameco’s allocation at 3.7 million pounds. No deliveries from Inkai are expected until the second half of the year.

**3. NexGen Energy** (NYSE:NXE,TSX:NXE,ASX:NXG)

**Market cap:** US$3.18 billion

NexGen Energy, a company specializing in uranium exploration and development, is primarily focused on the Athabasca Basin. Its flagship project is the Rook I project, which includes the Arrow discovery.

The company also owns a 50.1 percent interest in exploration-stage company IsoEnergy (TSXV:ISO,OTCQX:ISENF).

In its Q1 results, NexGen reported a net loss of C$50.9 million, driven primarily by an impairment on its investment in IsoEnergy and ongoing exploration spending at its Rook I uranium project. Despite the loss, NexGen maintained a cash position of C$434.6 million, down from C$476.6 million at the end of 2024. 

The largest component of the cash flow change was investing activities at C$34.3 million, mostly tied to C$28.1 million in exploration and evaluation expenses. The majority of this went toward technical work, permitting, and drilling at Rook I. NexGen also made a C$6.3 million follow-on investment in IsoEnergy. 

Financing activity was limited, with C$557,000 raised from stock option exercises and C$6.8 million in restricted cash movements, resulting in a total cash outflow of C$41.9 million.

The company continues to hold a strategic uranium inventory of 2.7 million pounds of U3O8, valued at C$341 million. While NexGen does not currently generate production revenue, it remains well-capitalized to fund its development plans as it progresses Rook I toward potential construction and licensing milestones.

In late March NexGen reported its “best ever discovery phase intercept” at Rook I. As noted in a press release, drill hole RK-25-232 at the Patterson Corridor East zone intersected 3.9 meters of exceptionally high uranium readings within a larger 13.8 meter mineralized section starting at 452.2 meters depth.

**4. Uranium Energy** (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC)

**Market cap:** US$2.36 billion

Uranium Energy (UEC) has two production-ready in-situ recovery (ISR) uranium projects — its Christensen Ranch uranium operations in Wyoming and its Texas Hub and Spoke operations in South Texas — as well as two operational processing facilities. It plans to restart uranium production in Wyoming in August and resume South Texas operations in 2025.

The firm has built one of the largest US-warehoused uranium inventories, and in 2022 secured a US Department of Energy contract to supply 300,000 pounds of U3O8 as part of the country's move to establish a domestic uranium reserve.

UEC also holds a wide portfolio of uranium projects in the US and Canada, some of which have major permits secured. In August 2022, UEC completed its acquisition of uranium company UEX. That same year, UEC also acquired both a portfolio of uranium exploration projects and the Roughrider uranium project from Rio Tinto (ASX:RIO,NYSE:RIO,LSE:RIO).

In January, UEC increased its stake in Anfield Energy (TSXV:AEC,OTCQB:ANLDF) by acquiring 107.1 million shares for approximately C$15 million, at C$0.14 per share. The deal boosts UEC’s ownership to about 17.8 percent. 

A month later, the company announced that it had achieved a key milestone by successfully processing, drying and drumming uranium at its Irigaray central processing plant in Wyoming. 

Uranium concentrate produced from the plant will be shipped to the ConverDyn conversion facility in Illinois.

In March, UEC released results for the quarter ended on January 31, highlighting that additional wellfields at Christensen Ranch were on track to begin production in the coming weeks. It also finalized the acquisition of Rio Tinto’s Sweetwater plant, adding 4.1 million pounds per year of licensed capacity and establishing its third ISR hub-and-spoke platform.

Financially, UEC reported Q2 revenue of US$49.8 million from selling 600,000 pounds of U3O8 at US$82.92 per pound, generating US$18.2 million in gross profit. The company holds 1.36 million pounds in uranium inventory valued at US$97.3 million, with an additional 300,000 pounds to be acquired at US$37.05 per pound this December.

In May, UEC signed a memorandum of understanding with Radiant Industries to collaborate on strengthening the US nuclear energy value chain. As part of the agreement, UEC will supply domestically sourced uranium to Radiant. The partnership supports Radiant’s development of the Kaleidos portable nuclear microreactor, which is planned to be mass produced, aligning with growing national interest in small modular reactors and energy security.

**5. Denison Mines** (NYSEAMERICAN:DNN,TSX:DML)

**Market cap:** US$1.33 billion

Denison Mines is focused on uranium mining in Saskatchewan's Athabasca Basin. holding a 95 percent interest in the Wheeler River uranium project, which hosts the Phoenix and Gryphon deposits.

The company has significant landholdings in the basin through both operating and non-operating joint venture interests with uranium majors such as Orano and Cameco. This includes a 22.5 percent interest in Orano's McLean Lake mill and mine, the latter of which is expected to re-enter production in 2025.

In 2023, Denison completed a feasibility study for Phoenix, which hosts proven and probable reserves of 56.7 million pounds of uranium. The company is planning to use ISR for Phoenix and is targeting first production for 2027 or 2028. Denison also updated a 2018 prefeasibility study for the Gryphon deposit as an underground mine. 

According to the company, both deposits have low-cost production potential.

In February, Denison announced that the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission has scheduled public hearings for the Phoenix ISR project, which will take place in two parts, one in October and one in December. 

The hearings are the final step in the federal approval process for the project’s environmental assessment and license to construct and prepare a uranium mine and mill.

On May 12, Denison released its results for the first quarter, noting that Phoenix had reached 75 percent completion for total engineering. If it receives approval later this year, Denison expects to begin construction for the Phoenix ISR operation in early 2026 and achieve production in 2028.

Meanwhile, site prep resumed at the McClean North deposit, which will be mined using the joint venture's proprietary SABRE mining method. Operations are on track to begin mid-year.

**FAQs for uranium investing**

**What is uranium?**

First discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Klaproth, uranium is a heavy metal that is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and molybdenum. Named after the planet Uranus, which was also discovered around the same time, uranium has been an important source of global energy for more than six decades.

**What country has the most uranium?**

Australia and Kazakhstan lead the world in both terms of uranium reserves and uranium production. Australia takes first prize for the world's largest uranium reserves, representing 28 percent globally at 1,684,100 MT of U3O8. However, the Oceanic country ranks fourth in global uranium production, putting out 4,087 MT of U3O8 in 2022. 

For its part, Kazakhstan controls 13 percent of global uranium reserves and leads the world in uranium production with 2022 output of 21,227 MT. Last year, Canada passed Namibia to become the second largest uranium producer, putting out 7,351 MT of U3O8 in 2022 compared to Namibia's 5,613 MT. The countries hold 10 percent and 8 percent of global reserves respectively.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.359776,2025-05-21T22:50:50,Rio Tinto,2025

there's no way that one can take and take from the natural system without contributing something back to keep it going for the future. and there are no good mines. i understand that people want energy, but the land can't take it anymore. we are destroying our life support system and having ""just a little taste of mining"" is a way to relegate certain places as sacrifice zones. folks seem to think that a mine is like one square on a game board that becomes polluted and off-limits. ""surely we can sacrifice one square, right?"" but it's never like that. you can't just dig a huge hole in the ground and not have it create huge consequences. heck, a friend of mine had a neighbor who cleared his lot of trees. guess what - she gets loads more water coming through her land now because there are no longer trees holding that water at the neighbor's lot. and we live in an area that's already quite rainy, so more water can be a huge problem. the neighbor probably thought that he was just doing something in his one square of the game board, but nature doesn't know anything about imaginary property lines. it's all interconnected.

anyway if anyone has any tips on talking to people about anti-extractivism, please let me know because i'm struggling.

829,1kpbdcp,"The Decline of Australia, is Australia a Political Disgrace?",agreen8919,/r/AustraliaFair/comments/1kpbdcp/the_decline_of_australia_is_australia_a_political/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaFair/comments/1kpbdcp/the_decline_of_australia_is_australia_a_political/,0,0,1747541414.0,"The Decline of Australia, a Political Disgrace?

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II\*\*. Erosion of Our Freedoms\*\*

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say. Divisive narratives are relentlessly pushed to fracture our unity, fuelling battles between generations, pitting gay against straight, splitting the LGBTQ community from those who advocate traditional family values, and even setting Christians against Muslims. These manufactured conflicts distract us from the true crimes taking place in our own backyard.

Under the guise of protecting public health, governments worldwide forced untested RNA vaccines on us for a virus that many contend was less threatening to humans than the common seasonal flu, stripping us of our right to decide for ourselves. The new government’s plan to tax unrealised gains threatens to crush farming families whose land, while appreciating in value “on paper,” does not generate liquid cash. Such a policy would force these families—whose heritage spans generations—to sell valued assets or incur crippling debt, effectively dismantling rural communities that have long been the backbone of Australia’s prosperity.

At the same time, the housing crisis has become an epidemic. In cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, property prices have soared far beyond the reach of young, hardworking Australians, leaving them unable to afford even modest homes. And while Australia continues to welcome migrants at record levels—a source of strength and diversity—the current system lacks adequate measures to integrate these newcomers properly. For me, having lived in Australia for over 20 years as a migrant from the UK, I have seen firsthand how immigration has the power to transform and enrich our nation. In theory, newcomers bring a vast array of cultures, ideas, and innovative skills that can add depth and strength to our society. Their diversity can fuel creativity, invigorate local economies, and broaden the social tapestry of our country. This potential, however, is only fully realised when immigrants are not just welcomed, but properly integrated into the fabric of our society.

Unfortunately, the current system falls short in providing the robust, targeted measures necessary for effective integration. Too often, new arrivals are greeted with a focus on preserving their distinct cultural identities without sufficient support to transition into the shared Australian way of life. Without comprehensive language training, cultural orientation programs, or well-designed community initiatives, many immigrants remain isolated within their own enclaves. This isolation means they may continue to rely on habits and practices that are perfectly acceptable in their home societies—but which, at times, clash with the core Australian values of egalitarianism, mateship, and the “fair go” spirit.

This gap in integration not only undermines the potential benefits of our rich diversity but also risks diluting the very essence of what is uniquely Australian. When newcomers are not fully acclimatised, the differences in values and norms can lead to misunderstandings and social friction. Instead of a unified society where differences are celebrated and combined to create a stronger national identity, we end up with parallel communities—each operating by its own rules. This fragmented state weakens the overall cohesion of our society and, over time, erodes the common cultural foundation that has long made Australia a resilient and distinct nation.

I have witnessed throughout my two decades here the gradual erosion of our shared values—a trend that many hardworking Australians are equally concerned about. If we fail to invest in coordinated, comprehensive integration programs, we risk not only missing out on the full benefits of a diverse society but also inadvertently fostering divisions that threaten the uniquely Australian spirit we have all come to cherish.

In essence, while immigration remains a vital source of strength and diversity, its true value can only be unlocked through policies that actively build bridges between the new and the established. Our future depends on supporting these newcomers sufficiently so that they can contribute to, and ultimately become an integral part of, the Australian way of life.

Let us not forget the bitter irony: Australia was founded as a penal colony—a place where convicts were sent to serve harsh sentences under brutal conditions. Today, under the crushing weight of exorbitant taxes, an unmanageable housing crisis, and an oppressive, profit‑driven system, our nation risks becoming a modern‑day penal colony—not with physical chains but with economic and social oppression, and relentless government overreach.

Every Aussie deserves a government that serves its people, protects our national wealth, and upholds the uniquely Australian spirit of resilience, mateship, and fairness. Through collective action, radical transparency, and an unwavering demand for accountability, we can reclaim our future, our freedom, and the very soul of our nation.

The time to fight back is now. Every single Aussie must stand together to shatter this corrupt system and rebuild Australia into a nation that truly embodies fairness, freedom, and a genuine fair go for all.

**XIX. Final Call to Action**  
This exposé stands as a raw, unfiltered testimony to the systemic exploitation of Australia’s people and serves as a comprehensive blueprint for real change. For every Aussie who cherishes our heritage, believes in true democracy, and refuses to be divided by imposed narratives—the battle for our future, our freedom, and our national sovereignty begins here and now. We must act decisively and relentlessly; the time has come to reclaim our rights, our wealth, and the spirit of Australia for ourselves and for future generations.

*For every Aussie ready to stand up and fight, our future is waiting—let’s unite and shape a nation that truly delivers that hard‑earned fair go we all deserve.*

Our uniquely Australian culture was forged in the harsh realities of our penal colony origins and built on the resilient spirit of convicts, pioneers, and bush legends—a culture steeped in mateship, self‑reliance, and egalitarian values. It is not defined by the values of the UK, USA, Africa, or China. Yet internal policies and external influences increasingly serve global investors instead of the people who truly call this land home. New government measures now threaten not only our economic independence—for example, by taxing unrealised gains that could force long‑standing farming families either to sell their cherished land or to fall into crippling debt—but also our personal freedoms by mandating untested RNA vaccines on a virus that many argue had far less impact than the yearly flu. Amid an ever‑worsening housing crisis that leaves young Aussies unable to buy a home, and while Australia continues welcoming migrants, there is a growing imperative for new arrivals to be properly acclimatized to our distinct Australian values and for adequate housing to be built so that all residents, old and new, can live with dignity.

The unfiltered truth is laid out below.

**I. When the “Fair Go” Gets Stolen**

Australia was built on the promise of a genuine “fair go”—the conviction that every individual deserves an honest opportunity at success. Yet that promise has been slowly and systematically eroded. Every day Australians now pay in excess of $20,000 per year in taxes despite having putted their hard work into this country. Instead of seeing those funds reinvested into our own communities, we watch in dismay as colossal projects, such as the $2.3‑billion National Broadband Network and the disastrous $10‑billion submarine deal, fail to deliver the promised benefits. Worse yet, our vital national assets—from our mineral wealth and natural gas reserves to the roads we rely on—are being transferred to foreign companies through secret deals. Extraction rights and mining licenses, which by law should benefit all Australians, are instead being granted to multinational corporations operating from boardrooms in Washington, London, Beijing, and even Moscow. Our hard‑earned cash is funnelled into secret offshore accounts and hidden backroom arrangements that enrich a very small circle of corrupt insiders, leaving everyday Aussies with crumbling services and an ever‑rising cost of living.

II**. Erosion of Our Freedoms**

There was a time when you could share your thoughts and opinions freely at a backyard barbeque or in your local pub. Today, however, government laws—such as the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill of 2024—grant officials sweeping power to silence anyone who dares to challenge the official narrative. In 2023 alone, scores of everyday Aussies were fined or threatened with legal action solely for posting their candid opinions online. This is not about protecting public safety; it is about controlling our voices and ensuring we remain compliant. At the same time, while our freedoms are being squeezed, our tax bills have skyrocketed. With every household paying over $20,000 a year, you would expect quality services and secure infrastructure, but our hospitals, schools, and public roads continue to crumble. Billions vanish into mega‑projects that are nothing more than money pits for the well‑connected few. The government now even dictates aspects of our daily lives by imposing bizarre bans on certain vaping products, arbitrary alcohol taxes, and even prescribing how we use energy. Public roads, once the pride of local community investment, have been privatised; we pay taxes to build them and then toll fees to drive on them, ensuring revenue flows to foreign investors while the quality of our infrastructure deteriorates.

**III. Economic Mismanagement and the Fraudulent Taxation Racket**

Beneath glossy promises of economic expansion lies a fiscal system meticulously designed to extract every dollar from the average Australian. Despite our crushing tax burden, the improvements promised in public services remain nothing more than a cruel illusion. Our money is swallowed up by inefficiency, mismanagement, and opaque financial arrangements. The notorious failures of projects like the NBN and the submarine contract serve as stark reminders of billions wasted on secret deals and disastrous planning, even as our basic infrastructure continues to deteriorate. Meanwhile, multinational corporations—many of which are now majority‑owned by foreign capital—exploit every loophole in our tax system. Operating out of boardrooms in the USA, the UK, and increasingly from Beijing (with occasional whispers of Russian influence), these corporations hide their enormous fortunes behind intricate offshore trusts and secretive deals. While everyday Aussies face rising living costs and vanishing public services, a select few grow ever richer in hidden secrecy.

**IV. The Sell‑Off of Our National Treasures: Natural Resources, Minerals, and Strategic Assets**

Australia is extraordinarily rich in natural resources—the backbone of our economy and a symbol of our rugged heritage. Our lands contain vast reserves of iron ore, coal, gold, copper, nickel, zinc, lead, uranium, bauxite, and rare earth elements, among countless other minerals. By law, these minerals belong to the Crown and are held in trust for every Australian. However, in practice, extraction rights and mining licenses are routinely awarded to private companies. Major mining giants such as BHP and Rio Tinto now dominate the sector. Research indicates that well over 86% of Australia’s mining operations are controlled by foreign investors; for example, BHP is estimated to be approximately 76% foreign‑owned, and Rio Tinto around 83% foreign‑owned. This means that a substantial proportion of the profits from our mineral wealth are funnelled off to international boardrooms—in Washington, London, and beyond—leaving little benefit for the Australian public. Every ton of iron ore, every ounce of gold, and every bit of coal extracted under these arrangements underscores how our true treasures are being commoditised and transferred to overseas investors, rather than being used to improve Australian lives.

**V. Infrastructure Neglect and the Toll of Privatisation**

Despite billions spent on fuel excises (which average 44 cents per litre) and road registration fees, our public infrastructure remains in a state of severe decay. Every day, Aussies experience the consequences of dilapidated roads, potholes, crumbling bridges, and outdated signage—all while funds earmarked for repairs disappear within bureaucratic inefficiencies. This crisis is made even worse by the pervasive privatisation of state‑built roads. Since the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s, many public roads have been sold off to private companies like Transurban—firms with strong financial ties to investors in Washington and London. Consequently, we are double‑taxed: first through government taxes to build the roads, and then through tolls to use them. The combined financial burden not only deepens the strain on everyday Australians but also ensures that profits are siphoned off to foreign bank accounts while our infrastructure continues to deteriorate.

**VI. NDIS and Healthcare: The Broken Promises to the Vulnerable**

Even as a corrupt elite line their own pockets, the government has systematically failed its most vulnerable citizens. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which was intended as a critical lifeline for Australians with disabilities, has devolved into a convoluted and inefficient bureaucratic maze. Genuine applicants are forced to exaggerate their conditions just to qualify for the minimal support available, and billions earmarked for vital services are lost to fraud and red tape. At the same time, healthcare costs have soared to unsustainable levels—essential treatments, especially in mental health, can often cost over $350 a session. Despite record tax revenues, hospitals, clinics, and other essential medical services remain critically underfunded, a damning indication that profit is being prioritized over the health and well‑being of the people.

**VII. Media Collusion and the Controlled Narrative**

A free and independent press is the cornerstone of any vibrant democracy, yet in Australia, our media is increasingly muzzled by governmental pressure and corporate interests. Investigative journalism—the very tool that once exposed corruption and held power to account—is now stifled by legal threats and deliberate political interference. The result is a sanitised, sensationalist narrative that rarely dares to question those at the top. With the public fed only a filtered version of reality, systemic corruption, mismanagement, and secret deals continue rampant, while the true issues remain hidden behind a facade of manufactured narratives controlled by the elite.

**VIII. Divide and Conquer: The Narratives That Tear Us Apart**

The strategies of our ruling elite extend far beyond fiscal manipulation—they are also designed to deliberately fracture our society. Divisive narratives are pushed relentlessly to pit group against group. Issues are magnified to create or exaggerate rifts between generations, to stoke conflicts between gay and straight communities, and to pit the so‑called LGBTQ agenda against what is touted as the “natural family” model. Even tensions between Christians and Muslims are amplified. This calculated division serves a singular purpose: by fracturing our unity, our leaders divert attention from the systemic theft of our national wealth and suppress any meaningful collective resistance. When we are busy fighting among ourselves, we are unable to challenge the real criminality occurring right at home.

**IX. The Housing Crisis, Young Australians, and Immigration—And the Need for Acclimatisation**

One of the most heartbreaking consequences of this pervasive mismanagement is the housing crisis that has left countless young Australians unable to afford a home. In major cities like Sydney and Melbourne, property prices have soared into the millions while new construction lags far behind demand. Soaring interest rates, inflexible zoning laws, and bureaucratic delays have effectively locked first‑time buyers out of the property market. At the same time, while Australia continues welcoming migrants at record levels—a policy that enriches our multicultural tapestry—there is a serious lack of infrastructure to support them. As a proud migrant from the UK, I value the diversity and energy that new arrivals bring. However, it is essential that immigration be managed responsibly. New migrants must be properly acclimatised to our uniquely Australian culture and values, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into our communities. Moreover, robust investment in affordable, high‑quality housing is imperative so that both new arrivals and existing Australians have access to secure homes. If our housing market continues to reject our own people while failing to provide for newcomers, social cohesion and our distinctly Australian way of life are at risk.

**X. Unrealised Gains Tax: Crushing Farming Families**

In yet another disheartening move, the new government proposes to tax unrealised gains—a policy that could have crushing effects on farming families. For generations, rural families have passed down land held within self‑managed super funds (SMSFs), watching its value steadily increase on paper as “unrealised gains” that only become real when the asset is sold. Taxing these gains forces families to pay tax on profits they have not actually received. This policy threatens to force many farming families into the painful choice between selling their cherished heritage or plunging into crippling debt just to meet tax obligations. The impact is not merely fiscal—it could dismantle long‑standing family farms, devastate rural communities, and undermine the very foundation of Australia’s agricultural prosperity. This measure stands as a stark example of how the government effectively acts as a leech, extorting money from those who have built their lives on the land.

**XI. Mandatory Vaccine Mandates: The Untested RNA Vaccine Order**

Under the guise of safeguarding public health, governments around the world—including here in Australia—imposed mandatory vaccination orders that forced the acceptance of untested RNA vaccines. Developed and deployed at breakneck speed during the COVID‑19 crisis, these vaccines were heralded as miraculous breakthroughs despite many experts later arguing that, for a majority of the population, COVID‑19 posed a threat far less severe than the seasonal flu. The unprecedented haste in their rollout meant that long‑term safety data were limited, and yet our right to choose was effectively trampled upon. This mandate is yet another glaring instance of government overreach; it is a policy that prioritises centralised control over individual freedom in the name of crisis management, even when the proportional threat was—and in many cases remains—questionable.

**XII. Questionable Legislation Passed Without Public Approval**

Some of the most damaging changes to our society have been imposed on us without a single public vote or genuine debate. Laws enacted behind closed doors have stripped away our rights and privatised our public assets to further benefit the elite. For instance, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment of 2015 compelled ISPs and telcos to store every bit of our personal data for up to two years, implemented without a national referendum, despite strong public opposition regarding privacy. Similarly, the Identify and Disrupt Bill of 2021 granted law enforcement vast powers to hack private digital communications with minimal public debate. Economic measures, such as amendments to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, were crafted with the ostensible goal of ensuring fair taxation of oil and gas companies, yet instead opened loopholes that allow foreign investors to avoid billions in tax. Concurrently, the regulations of the Foreign Investment Review Board have been manipulated to permit vast foreign control over our land, housing, and infrastructure—all enacted with little or no public input. Harsh anti‑protest laws in Victoria, NSW, and Queensland now criminalise peaceful dissent, while the Disinformation and Misinformation Bill restricts the range of public discourse, effectively ensuring that only government‑sanctioned narratives prevail. Environmental policies—such as those privatising water rights in the Murray‑Darling Basin and the controversial sale of toll roads—have further sealed our future to the detriment of everyday Aussies.

**XIII. Who Owns What and Where They Operate From**

A critical indicator of our national decline is the systematic surrender of our assets to foreign investors. Today, at least 15 of Australia’s top 20 companies are majority‑owned by American capital. Major banks and industrial giants such as BHP and the Commonwealth Bank are now managed from boardrooms in Washington, where decisions prioritise profit over the public good. British capital remains deeply embedded in our mining, real estate, and transport sectors, with key toll road operators and vast property empires managed out of London’s financial district. Chinese investments are rapidly expanding in strategic sectors like energy, natural resources, and property, while even Russian money has, on occasion, found footholds in our energy and commodities markets. These powerful foreign investors operate from global financial hubs—Washington, London, Beijing, and Moscow—making decisions that shape our national wealth and determine our future without any accountability to the Australian people.

**XIV. War Narratives and the Art of Distractive Control**

While our country is being systematically pillaged and our freedoms steadily eroded, our political leaders are masters at manufacturing international crises to distract us. When conflicts like the Ukraine‑Russia war dominate global headlines, the government seizes those moments to push through unpopular laws and accelerate the privatisation of public assets. These external crises act as deliberate smokescreens, keeping our collective attention on distant battles while domestic corruption, mismanagement, and the exploitation of our resources continue unabated. A glaring example is the oil price farce: despite sanctions driving Russian oil prices below $60 per barrel (with an official cap at $69), everyday Australians were still forced to pay steep fuel prices. Global supply chain disruptions, spiralling shipping costs, rampant market speculation, and opportunistic profit‑hiking ensured that the promised benefits of lower oil prices never reached the pump, while Russia was forced to shift its export strategies, further destabilising the market. By magnifying external threats, our leaders distract us from the very real internal theft of our national wealth.

**XV. Corruption Across All Parties and Political Misdeeds**

Corruption in Australia is endemic—it does not belong to one party or political stripe but pervades the entire system. From the earliest days of our federation to the modern era, politicians from all sides have been implicated in shady deals, secret offshore trusts, and backroom arrangements that conceal their true fortunes. Both the Labour and Liberal parties—and various minor groups—have been rocked by scandals involving branch stacking, the misuse of public funds, and clandestine portfolios designed solely for personal enrichment. High‑profile figures have repeatedly manipulated party structures and financial channels, amassing hidden wealth while leaving the public in the dark. The same disheartening pattern appears time and time again: our leaders are far more concerned with filling their secret bank accounts than with legitimately serving the interests of the Australian people.

**XVI. Defending Our Australian Culture**

At the very core of Australia lies a unique culture—one that is distinctly our own. Forged in the crucible of penal colony origins and tempered by the rugged resilience, mateship, and egalitarian spirit of our pioneers and bush legends, our culture is inherently Australian. It is not a mere copy of British, American, African, or Chinese culture; it is a rich tapestry of our own values, histories, and traditions. Yet external influences and divisive internal narratives increasingly threaten to dilute this identity. The elite and sensationalist media continuously push policies and narratives aimed at fragmenting our society by pitting different groups against one another and undermining our national unity. In order to preserve the soul of our nation, we must fiercely defend our uniquely Australian culture and ensure that our public policies and societal values reflect the traditions and spirit that have been passed down through generations.

**XVII. Proposed Solutions and the Call for Action**

The evidence is overwhelming and damning—Australia’s political system is rigged to benefit a small global elite at the expense of every hardworking Aussie. But there is hope if we, the people, demand transformative change.

First, we must strengthen accountability and transparency. Power must be returned to the people through direct mechanisms such as referendums, participatory budgeting, and community oversight committees. Every dollar spent by the government—including money siphoned off through secret backroom deals—must be brought into full public view. Independent anti‑corruption institutions must be established, free from political interference, with the authority to investigate and prosecute wrongdoing at every level.

Our taxation system requires radical reform as well. Multinational companies, regardless of the origins of their investors, must be compelled to pay their fair share, with revenue from these measures reinvested directly into essential public services—hospitals, schools, and the creation of affordable housing. We must also reclaim our strategic assets—including toll roads, natural resource rights, and water licenses—from foreign control, whether by renegotiation or, if necessary, outright repurchase, to ensure that the financial benefits remain within Australia.

Restoring media independence is absolutely critical. Legal protections for investigative journalism, paired with a diversified and publicly accountable funding model, will ensure that the full truth reaches every corner of our nation instead of being filtered through government‑sanctioned narratives.

Finally, grassroots activism must be mobilised. Local communities, protest movements, and digital campaigns need to unite to demand accountability, structural change, and an end to divisive policies that exploit or divide us. Strategic litigation against oppressive laws and inequitable asset sell‑offs will help safeguard our constitutional rights and halt the systematic erosion of our freedoms.

**XVIII. Reclaiming Our Future, Our Freedom, and Our National Sovereignty**

The truth is raw and unyielding—Australia’s political system has been hijacked by corrupt insiders and foreign investors who profit while every Aussie suffers. Our taxes fund mismanaged billion‑dollar projects and enrich a global elite; our natural resources and public assets are sold off behind closed doors; and our freedoms are steadily choked by draconian laws imposed without our say.

# US President Donald Trump has launched an investigation into critical minerals, signalling further tariffs in the natural resources sector. The move follows Beijing’s announcement of export restrictions on rare earths, marking an escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to initiate an investigation into critical minerals, potentially leading to additional tariffs on industrial resources. The move follows recent probes into chip and pharmaceutical imports, signalling a further broadening of the global trade war.

The investigation, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, aims to “determine the effects on national security of imports of processed critical minerals and their derivative products,” according to the official document. “Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, in the form of processed minerals are essential raw materials and critical production inputs required for economic and national security.” The same law was previously used by Trump to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, as well as to launch a probe into copper imports.

Last month, the president signed an executive order to boost domestic production of critical minerals by invoking the Defence Production Act, providing support such as financing and loans to the sector. The measure is widely seen as targeting China, which dominates the global supply chain.

# Trump’s strategic approach to leverage US power in the trade war with China

According to the White House, the US relies on imports of 15 critical minerals, 70% of which originate from China. Last Friday, Beijing announced export restrictions on a wide range of critical minerals, such as germanium, gallium, antimony, and magnets, in response to Trump’s sharp tariff hikes.

Last month, the president signed an executive order to boost domestic production of critical minerals by invoking the Defence Production Act, providing support such as financing and loans to the sector. The measure is widely seen as targeting China, which dominates the global supply chain.

# Trump’s strategic approach to leverage US power in the trade war with China

According to the White House, the US relies on imports of 15 critical minerals, 70% of which originate from China. Last Friday, Beijing announced export restrictions on a wide range of critical minerals, such as germanium, gallium, antimony, and magnets, in response to Trump’s sharp tariff hikes.

The US has only one rare earth mine and no domestic smelters, leaving it heavily reliant on China for natural resources, including rare earths and critical minerals—vital components in electric devices, battery-powered vehicles, aircraft, and defence equipment. A TD Economics report reveals that China dominates the global production of more than half of the 50 critical minerals identified by the US government in 2022. It also maintains a near-monopoly in refining, processing 90% of global rare earth elements. To strengthen its hand in the trade war, the US will need to diversify sourcing of these industrial materials.

“Processed critical minerals and their derivative products face significant global supply chain vulnerabilities and market distortions due to reliance on a small number of foreign suppliers,” Tuesday’s investigation document states, “The dependence of the United States on imports and the vulnerability of our supply chains raises the potential for risks to national security, defence readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience.”

In February, Trump demanded $500 billion (€442 billion) worth of Ukraine’s rare earth and critical minerals as part of peace talks, a move also seen as a strategic effort to enhance the US’s position against China.

# Market responses

Australia’s major mining stocks fell during Wednesday’s Asian session, with shares of BHP falling 1.2%, Rio Tinto sliding 2.3%, and Phibara Minerals dropping 2.9% as of 5:52 am CEST. In commodities, iron ore (CFR China) futures on the SGX declined 0.35%, while copper futures fell 0.91%.

The downturn in the resource sector may also be linked to reports that Nvidia is facing new US export restrictions to China, which could cost the tech giant billions of dollars. These fresh regulations are expected to dampen demand for industrial resources such as copper and certain critical minerals used in chip manufacturing. Combined with Trump’s latest probe, the news has contributed to broader market weakness.

European markets may soon feel the ripple effects of the intensifying global trade war, with stock futures pointing to a lower open across major indices.

# APWORKS, Equispheres partner to produce high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy for 3D printing.

In a move to strengthen North America's supply of advanced aerospace materials, APWORKS, an Airbus subsidiary specializing in metal 3D printing, and Equispheres, a Canadian aluminum powder producer, have partnered to establish regional production of Scalmalloy, a high-performance aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy engineered for additive manufacturing.

Developed for laser powder bed fusion and critical applications demanding strength, weldability, and corrosion resistance, Scalmalloy bridges the gap between traditional aerospace-grade metals and next-generation manufacturing technologies.

Until now, the alloy's availability has been largely limited to Europe and Asia, creating supply challenges for North American manufacturers looking to accelerate additive production.

Eliminating one of the final barriers to adoption, the newest partnership will see Equispheres produce Scalmalloy powder optimized for 3D printing from primarily domestic raw materials – a move designed to support aerospace, defense, and industrial users seeking faster, more reliable access to high-performance alloys.

The company's proprietary powder technology, designed for high uniformity and print speed without compromising mechanical integrity, will bring new scalability to a material prized for its combination of strength and lightweight performance.

""Scalmalloy will be a great addition to our line of high-performance materials for serial additive manufacturing,"" said Equispheres CEO Kevin Nicholds. ""North American supply of critical materials such as aluminum-scandium alloys is a key step toward securing the aerospace supply chain.""

Long overlooked due to its scattered distribution, scandium remains difficult to produce at scale despite being more abundant in Earth's crust than lead – a constraint that has kept global output low and supply chains heavily dependent on Chinese, Russian, and Kazakh sources.

[New recovery efforts in Canada](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/09/16/critical-minerals-alliances-2024/north-america-fortifies-scandium-supply/1936.html), however, are beginning to shift that balance – momentum that partnerships like APWORKS and Equispheres are now positioned to accelerate.

""Equispheres is a logical choice for expanding Scalmalloy production into North America,"" said APWORKS CEO Jonathan Meyer. ""Their expertise in producing high-quality aluminum powders for additive manufacturing, combined with access to domestic aluminum and scandium sources, positions them well for building supply chain resilience.""

[A bionic cabin partition created by Airbus, Autodesk, and APWORKS illustrates how Scalmalloy and generative design deliver lightweight, load-bearing aerospace structures.](https://preview.redd.it/x35ytjhojyxe1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65646d5a23cb94fbc68d73302eb5637ae516932)

Beyond raw availability, domestic production of Scalmalloy streamlines qualification and part certification processes by reducing lead times and material variability – factors that often limit implementation in regulated aerospace and defense systems. Powder produced to North American specifications can be aligned more directly with design, testing, and production schedules.

Equispheres' process yields spherical, size-controlled powder engineered for consistent flow and packing density. These properties support faster build rates, reduced defect occurrence, and tighter dimensional accuracy – factors essential to scaling metal additive manufacturing in aerospace, propulsion, and satellite component production.

As global supply chains evolve to prioritize regional production of strategic materials, the APWORKS–Equispheres partnership aligns with broader Western initiatives to secure alloy inputs for aircraft, defense platforms, and industrial systems. Scalmalloy's entry into North American production adds a flight-proven, data-supported material to the region's additive manufacturing infrastructure.

Already validated in Formula 1 racing and aerospace prototypes, Scalmalloy delivers the structural performance – high tensile strength, fatigue resistance, corrosion durability – required for next-generation manufacturing.

***NioCorp’s Potential Commercial Production of Al-Sc Master Alloy Could Launch Prior to the Company’s Planned Production of &gt;100 Tonnes/Year of Scandium Oxide at its Proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska and Would Use Scandium Produced at the Elk Creek Facility as well as From Other Sources***

***China Now Dominates the Scandium World, but North America is Now Positioned to Emerge as a “Leading Scandium Producer,” says NioCorp CEO***

**CENTENNIAL, Colo. (May 29, 2023) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“NioCorp” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:NB) (TSX:NB) today announced its intent to launch a phased approach to commercial-scale production of aluminum-scandium (“Al-Sc”) master alloy in the US for commercial and defense applications.  Coupled with the Company’s intended plans to produce more than 100 tonnes per year of scandium oxide from its proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the “Elk Creek Project”) in southeast Nebraska, and depending upon the results of the Al-Sc master alloy initiative, receipt of necessary funding and other factors, the initiative could establish the US as a leading producer of scandium, according to NioCorp CEO and Executive Chairman Mark A Smith.**

**Under an exclusive agreement with Boston-based Nanoscale Powders LLC (“Nanoscale”) the initial work is expected to result in the production of several ingots of Al-Sc master alloy at potentially commercial amounts of scandium content using a proprietary process developed by Nanoscale that increases efficiency and reduces environmental impacts of Al-Sc production over traditional approaches.**

# &gt;ON ~MAY, 26th 2023~Trying to get a handle on REE's I asked Jim to comment on the following: We have the NI43-101 report stating pounds in the ground and recent news (as mentioned below) stating 92% recoveries.

***NioCorp’s Rare Earth Demonstration Plant Showing Strong Rare Earth Recovery Results, in Line with Expectationshttps://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-rare-earth-demonstration-plant-showing-strong-rare-earth-recovery-results-in-line-with-expectations/***

*JIM - What I’m trying to deduce is final tonnage/output. Early on Scott mentioned expected over 750 tons per year of REE.* *Can you offer comment:*

**\*\*RESPONSE**

# ""REE separations extraction of the individual elements will result in only about a 1% further reduction in the overall REE recovery rate we have already demonstrated for extracting the REEs from solution as a group, as SX it is a very efficient process and our folks have years of experience of doing this kind of REE separation and purification at commercial scale. Thus, it is safe to assume at this point that total REE recovery rate from ore to final separated product will be around 92%. This is about the same as our scandium recovery rate, which is not surprising given that Scandium behaves just like the other REEs in solution.""

# ""NioCorp has not made a final determination on which REE products we will make, including tonnages, etc.. That determination can only be made in the context of publication of an updated Feasibility Study.""   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(THE NEW FINAL DEFINITIVE 2025 F.S. IS NOW UNDERWAY!!!!)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

The insider buying demonstrates strategic foresight as lithium consumption is projected to experience a fast rate of aproximatly 15-25% between 2025-2035, with market value expected to reach USD 16 billion in 2025 based on the estimated demand of 1.5 million metric tonnes and the current prices of lithium. Experts anticipate the market will shift from current conditions to a significant supply deficit by the end of the decade, driving renewed interest in high-quality development assets.

Rising Global Demand Amid Supply Constraints
NOA’s development progress coincides with accelerating global demand for lithium, primarily driven by electric vehicle production and ESS (Energy Storage Systems). According to S&amp;P Global data, global plug-in electric vehicle sales reached 16.5 million units in 2024, a 28.5% increase from the previous year.

The EV market seems to be approaching a critical tipping point, with new models achieving price parity with internal combustion engine vehicles while offering approximately 80% lower operating and maintenance costs. Recent technological breakthroughs are also addressing charging speed concerns, with China’s BYD unveiling a revolutionary new Super e-Platform on March 17, 2025.

The platform’s flash-charge batteries support an unprecedented 10 C charging multiplier—the highest of any mass-produced power battery in the world—enabling a theoretical full charge in just six minutes. According to BYD, the system features charging voltages of up to 1,000 V and currents of up to 1,000 A, enabling charging power of 1,000 kW (1 megawatt), twice the peak power of Tesla’s latest V4 supercharger.

China continues to lead this growth, accounting for 86% of the global increase in EV sales in 2024 according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights data released in February 2025. The country recently doubled nationwide EV subsidies, and has nearly tripled its lithium reserves, making it the second-largest holder worldwide behind Australia.

Meanwhile, the development timeline for new lithium mines remains challenging, typically taking around 16 years from discovery to production. This supply constraint, coupled with surging demand, creates a favorable long-term outlook for established projects in mining-friendly jurisdictions like NOA’s portfolio in Argentina.

Competitive Landscape
NOA’s continued advancement places it in a strong position among lithium developers, particularly following Rio Tinto’s $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium in October 2024, which validated the premium valuations for quality lithium assets in the region.

The lithium market is entering a phase of extraordinary growth. With the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimating a tenfold increase in lithium demand for batteries alone between 2020 and 2030, major automotive manufacturers and battery producers are aggressively securing sustainable, long-term supply.

With a strengthened financial position following the Clean Elements investment, NOA continues to advance exploration and development activities across its 140,000-hectare portfolio, which includes the Rio Grande, Arizaro, and Salinas Grandes projects. The company plans to begin water exploration drilling at Rio Grande before the end of the first quarter of 2025, with engineering proposals for the project’s preliminary economic assessment currently under evaluation. This progress positions NOA to potentially become a significant contributor to global lithium supply as the market faces projected shortfalls later this decade.

The U.S. faces a stark vulnerability: an overwhelming reliance on imported critical minerals, particularly from China, which controls nearly 60% of global rare earth mining and over 90% of rare earth processing capacity. Of the 12 “strategic defense critical minerals” identified by [Silverado Policy Accelerator](https://silverado.org/data-dashboards/strategic-defense-critical-minerals-production-dashboard/) as posing the greatest risk to U.S. national security,^(1) China is the top producer of all but one (arsenic trioxide). Additionally, resource-rich nations like Australia, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of Congo produce much of the world’s “battery metals” like lithium, cobalt, graphite, manganese, copper, and nickel, but these raw materials are sent to China for processing, creating a supply chain bottleneck. This monopsonistic arrangement has allowed China to consolidate its power over global supply chains, a strategic advantage that is intrinsically aligned with its broader national security and geopolitical ambitions. 

https://preview.redd.it/9lxm4bp96die1.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=972cacb30fdfcd81a825cb40036ed25d1d33f06c

Although recent rollbacks in U.S. electric vehicle mandates may slightly temper demand for traditional market-driving minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, the overall demand for critical minerals remains [robust](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trumps-ev-rollback-not-expected-suppress-appetite-critical-minerals-2025-01-21/). Simultaneously, more niche minerals with limited market presence but immense importance to advanced technologies—such as gallium, germanium, and antimony—are subject to escalating supply pressures. Recent export bans by China have highlighted the U.S.’s acute dependence on foreign supply of these materials: 100% import-reliant for gallium, 50% for germanium, and 83% for antimony. With over half of U.S. imports for these minerals sourced directly from China—and even when importing from partner nations like Belgium, Germany, or Japan, there is often upstream [exposure](https://www.exiger.com/perspectives/weaponization-of-the-periodic-table-crimps-u-s-critical-minerals-supply-chains/#:~:text=Level%20Intelligence%2C%20Exiger-,How%20Are%20These%20Minerals%20Used?,through%20stibnite%20(Sb2S3)%20ore.) to China—supply chains remain vulnerable to strategic manipulation that could erode U.S. hegemony and military power. 

Addressing this challenge requires a nuanced approach, as each critical mineral has a unique value and supply chain. Some are byproducts of other industrial processes, others are routinely considered waste, or “tailings,” in commercially viable operations (e.g., antimony alongside gold and tantalum/niobium with tin), and many traverse multiple countries from extraction to end use. Additionally, these materials often lack market prices due to their small quantities and China’s ability to manipulate supply and demand dynamics through non-market practices and its dominance over mid-stream processing. 

Critical minerals, therefore, must not be viewed as a monolithic category but as a diverse group of resources with distinct supply chain vulnerabilities. The urgency to develop comprehensive strategies for securing each of these resources cannot be overstated. Overcoming this decades-long deficit will require targeted efforts to ensure supply chain resilience, reduce dependency on foreign adversaries, and balance domestic production with strategic global partnerships. 

***Figure 2. Recent Executive Orders on Critical Minerals***

https://preview.redd.it/ltsnfztg6die1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12b2fa113e580c73a62822e8898659f2685b73d3

Recognizing this strategic vulnerability, President Donald Trump’s **“Unleashing American Energy”** and **“Declaring a National Energy Emergency”** executive orders prioritize the development of domestic critical mineral supply chains. These orders elevate the priority of energy independence, reducing reliance on malign foreign states. Under “Restoring America’s Mineral Dominance,” cabinet officials have been granted such responsibilities as updating critical mineral classifications, accelerating geological mapping, maintaining the National Defense Stockpile, and assessing security implications. Meanwhile “Unleashing American Energy” prioritizes expediting domestic resource development by streamlining the permitting process and incentivizing private sector investment in domestic mining and refining capacity. 

These actions signal a strong commitment to reshaping the U.S. critical mineral landscape by instructing agencies to weed out impediments to building our domestic mineral base. However, targeting domestic capacity alone is insufficient for meeting surging demand with resilient supply. 

**Challenges to Domestic Mining**  

While these executive orders emphasize boosting domestic capacity, significant challenges hinder the U.S.’s ability to mine and process all its own critical minerals. More specific action items must be identified to minimize mineral dependence and its consequences. 

Developing a mine in the U.S. takes an average of [29 years](https://cdn.ihsmarkit.com/www/pdf/0724/SPGlobal_NMA_DevelopmentTimesUSinPerspective_June_2024.pdf), the second-longest in the world, from first discovery to first production. This is largely due to complex permitting and environmental review processes. While mining companies expect the new administration’s emphasis on resource extraction will [expedite ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-bets-trump-will-give-green-light-us-copper-mine-ft-reports-2025-01-22/)these timetables, mining is an inherently disruptive industry. Mining projects such as Nevada’s [Thacker Pass](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/business/lithium-mining-race.html) face [opposition](https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/lets-not-blow-up-a-mountain-and-call-it-green-thacker-pass-lithium/) from local communities due to concerns about the strain on local resources, particularly the enormous [water](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/mining-water-use#overview) requirements, which can lead to shortages or contamination. 

Additionally, high operational costs, volatile mineral prices, and limited refining infrastructure can make domestic mining projects financially challenging. This is why strategies informed by comprehensive reviews of domestic resources are essential, along with a thorough review of the entire supply chain. To help ameliorate these inefficiencies, DevTech partner the Critical Minerals Forum (CMF) brings together private sector stakeholders and premier data firms to understand underlying structural prices and supply-demand dynamics. Since there are weak incentives for private sector entities to invest in critical mineral projects given the long lead times and complex risks, the U.S. Government must identify these vulnerabilities and collaborate with the private sector to develop comprehensive strategies and financing arrangements that ensure a secure and resilient supply of minerals. This is especially the case for minerals important to national security but currently perceived as “uneconomical” due to low prices offered by the Chinese market and commercial insignificance by miners looking to turn profits.  

The U.S. needs to identify “easy wins” to start diversifying its mineral supply chains domestically. As the executive orders note, many of these resources are already available within the U.S.; we simply need to take stock of material pipelines where critical minerals are currently overlooked. There are existing “[legacy](http://pathfindertonopah.com/the-project/)” brownfield (abandoned or idled sites that were previously used and still contain valuable resources) mine [sites](https://perpetuaresources.com/project/) around the U.S. and Canada that require minimal upstart. These could be moved forward through the introduction of financial capital or the expedition of regulatory processes. Additionally, expanding domestic mineral recycling—both from tailings and end-use products—can provide a valuable complementary supply source while reducing the environmental impacts of new mining operations.  

While developing domestic mining infrastructure—a process that takes decades—the U.S. can leverage its world-leading energy infrastructure to build its own processing capacity, which is where the competition with China is most dire. Regardless of whether large-scale domestic mining is economically viable or logistically feasible in the U.S., critical raw materials mined around the world are overwhelmingly sent to China for refinement. Even with significant mineral deposits, the U.S. lacks sufficient facilities to process and refine many raw materials into useable forms. Developing such processing and refining facilities represents a tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to solve its critical mineral problem. As China has understood for decades, the value of mining is not in the mine but in the processing of minerals; control over processing equates to control over the market. 

**Role of Global Partnerships** 

In addition to prioritizing onshore domestic production—as outlined by the executive orders—and developing processing capacity, to further erode China’s edge in the critical minerals sector, the U.S. must look beyond its borders; this will be essential to derisking supply chains. 

Strong partnerships with developing nations can help counterbalance China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has consolidated its influence over the global south, particularly global resource-rich countries, by leveraging state-backed financing to secure long-term control over strategic mineral deposits. Rather than relying on traditional supply or offtake agreements—where companies secure future access to mined materials through pre-arranged contracts—China has prioritized direct ownership stakes in high-value mines and issues consistent, serial financing to Chinese companies. According to a new AidData [report](https://docs.aiddata.org/reports/china-transition-minerals-2025/FULL_REPORT_Power_Playbook.pdf), only four percent of China’s official sector lending commitments for all BRI projects are guaranteed by a Chinese entity, while 25 percent of lending for transition minerals projects (cobalt copper, lithium, nickel, and rare earth elements) is backed by a Chinese guarantor, suggesting Chinese firms have higher vested interest in the critical mineral sector than in other industrial sectors.  

Targeted development assistance in mineral-rich countries presents a would be a significant way of diversifying U.S. supply chains while countering China’s malign and omnipresent control over supply chains from mine to end-use. The U.S. cannot place tariffs on minerals for which it has no feasible capacity to otherwise supply; the country needs to build its stockpile by freeing up funding to support otherwise “uneconomical” projects. Where it is completely unfeasible to develop domestic supply chains for specific minerals, the U.S. could engage with such mining leaders as Canada and Australia. Collaborations could include the transfer of advanced mining and processing technologies, helping resource-rich countries unlock their potential while creating reliable U.S. supply chains. Without coordinated action by market-oriented nations, alongside industry and other stakeholders, these vulnerabilities to Chinese non-market policies and practices are likely to [persist](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2025/01/united-states-and-norway-issue-innovative-report-creating-greater). 

Another strategic avenue for sourcing critical minerals is Ukraine, whose vast reserves have gained [political](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-says-he-wants-ukraine-supply-us-with-rare-earths-2025-02-03/) [momentum](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/12/18/trump-ukraine-gas-mineral-russia-peace-deal/) as a focal point for Western efforts to counterbalance Russian influence and secure diversified supply chains. The Breadbasket of Europe’s extensive critical mineral reserves present a strategic opportunity for the U.S. to secure vital resources while ensuring tangible returns on its support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression. Resource-rich Central Asian nations like Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have also gained [prominence](https://centralasiaprogram.org/publications-all/reducing-us-dependency-on-chinese-critical-minerals-2/) in U.S. geopolitical discussions. These politically popular destinations offer the dual benefit of offsetting Russian and Chinese influence through economic partnerships while serving as an overlooked source of critical raw materials for the U.S. 

The U.S. Government’s Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which leverages equity investments, debt financing, risk insurance, and technical assistance, has been identified by the new administration as a key channel that could tailor U.S. foreign assistance in a more strategic manner. The DFC has already begun financing U.S. minerals security, though only about [one percent](https://devtechsys-my.sharepoint.com/personal/clawson_devtechsys_com/Documents/Documents/DFCProjects) of active projects are in the mining/quarry sector. For example, the Lobito Corridor has been a pivotal investment, revitalizing a 1,300 kilometer rail line running through Zambia and the DRC into the Lobito port in Angola. This project aims to expand and safeguard critical mineral supply chains by enhancing U.S.-led regional connectivity and reducing reliance on Chinese infrastructure.  

The DFC should also consider increasing investment in mineral traceability. Manufacturers are willing to pay a premium for a reliable and traceable supply of critical minerals. Traceability is crucial because many resource-rich, developing countries lack strong legal systems, creating opportunities for smuggling and illicit trade. China leverages this smuggling to increase their processing feedstock, while U.S. companies are hampered by “non-conflict mineral” regulations (e.g., [3TG provisions in the Dodd Frank Act](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2012-2012-163htm)). This approach is counterproductive, forcing the issue down the supply chain, and enabling China to dominate the refinement of key minerals without competing U.S. investment. For example, tantalum, a vital mineral in alloys and advanced processors, is subject to ethical concerns about its sourcing. Better traceability would allow the DFC to target low-capital investments for processing capacity in Africa and similar regions. However, the DFC’s current [focus](https://www.dfc.gov/eligibility/where-we-work/places-dfc-unable-to-provide-support) on low- and middle-income countries could restrict the U.S.’s investment options for mineral security. 

**Conclusion** 

China’s dominance in critical mineral supply chains poses a significant threat to U.S. economic, technological, and national security. Without strategic action, the U.S. risks falling behind in this crucial competition, which will determine future technological advancements, defense capabilities, and global influence. 

Meeting this challenge requires a multipronged approach. Domestically, the Trump administration has signaled support for streamlining permitting processes to accelerate domestic mining. In the meantime, however, the U.S. must also take immediate action by: 

* Supporting existing brownfield projects, 

* Mapping strategies for recovering critical minerals from existing, commercially viable projects, and  

* Leveraging world-class energy infrastructure for building out domestic processing capacity. 

At the same time, the U.S. cannot afford to ignore the importance of partnerships. Collaborating with resource-rich countries presents an opportunity to diversify supply chains, strengthen economic alliances, and curtail Chinese influence. Strategic intervention through entities like the DFC exemplifies how the U.S. can align foreign assistance with mineral security, easing supply bottlenecks while fostering global stability and innovation. 

As a technology-centered firm with an international focus, DevTech Systems looks forward to supporting the U.S. Government in driving these changes, securing the country’s ability to sustainably power semiconductors, defense systems, and AI-driven solutions. 

# FEB. 10th 2025~Hypersonic engine technologies

[Hypersonic engine technologies](https://warwingsdaily.com/hypersonic-engine-technologies/)

https://preview.redd.it/g75qhzx79cie1.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9941c72e46a4d6b4d6694d328e970627ab5bc3c3

Hypersonic engines represent a major advance in aeronautical propulsion, enabling vehicles to exceed speeds of Mach 5, or more than 6,125 km/h. Aimed at an audience of aeronautical engineers, this article offers a detailed analysis of the technologies that power these engines, focusing on their operation, performance, efficiency and future prospects.

# How hypersonic engines work

Hypersonic engines operate on the same principle as ramjet propulsion, but at speeds where the air flows even faster. The most studied engine in this field is the scramjet. Unlike conventional jet engines, it has no moving parts to compress the incoming air. Air compression relies entirely on the high speed of the engine, making for a simpler, lighter design.

# Scramjet operating principle

In a scramjet engine, incoming air is slowed but remains at supersonic speeds as it passes through the combustion chamber. It is then mixed with a fuel – usually hydrogen – which is injected and ignited. At these speeds, combustion must be stabilized to prevent the fuel from being ejected before it has burned completely.

This process involves several key steps:

1. Aerodynamic compression: Air enters the engine’s air intake and is compressed solely by the speed of the engine.
2. Injection and supersonic combustion: Hydrogen is injected into the compressed air, then ignited. Unlike conventional jet engines, the air in the combustion chamber remains supersonic.
3. Expansion and thrust: The burnt gases escape at high speed through the nozzle, generating hypersonic thrust.

# Operating range and thermal constraints

Scramjets are optimized for speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 15 (around 6,125 km/h to 18,375 km/h). By comparison, a conventional turbojet engine becomes ineffective above Mach 3, as its compressors can no longer cope with high speeds.

However, hypersonic flight generates extreme temperatures in excess of 2,000°C on exposed surfaces. To prevent component deterioration, advanced materials such as ultra-refractory ceramics and ceramic matrix composites are used to protect the combustion chamber and engine structure.

# Application example

A concrete example of a scramjet engine is NASA’s X-43A, which reached Mach 9.6 in a flight test in 2004. This test confirmed that supersonic combustion was viable and that the scramjet could operate stably at extremely high speeds.

Research is continuing to improve the reliability of scramjets, notably by optimizing fuel injection and thermal management, with a view to developing military and civil applications for hypersonic flight.

# Hypersonic engine performance

Hypersonic engines are designed to operate at extreme speeds, where aerodynamic and thermal conditions are totally different from conventional subsonic and supersonic engines. Their range of efficiency lies between Mach 5 and Mach 15 (around 6,125 km/h to 18,375 km/h). At these speeds, airflow dynamics and thermal management are major challenges for maintaining engine stability and efficiency.

# Speed and energy efficiency

Supersonic combustion ramjets (scramjets) require no compressor or turbine, which reduces their mass and complexity. However, their energy efficiency remains lower than that of conventional jet engines at low altitudes and speeds. They become more efficient at very high altitudes (between 30 and 50 km) where air density is low, thus minimizing drag.

One of the most striking tests was carried out in 2004 with NASA’s X-43A, which reached Mach 9.6 at an altitude of around 33 km. More recently, China tested an engine capable of reaching Mach 16, or around 19,600 km/h.

# Thermal constraints and advanced materials

Temperatures in hypersonic flight exceed 2,000°C due to air compression and friction. This calls for the use of high-temperature-resistant materials, such as :

* Ceramic matrix composites (CMC): used for the combustion chamber and nozzle.
* Refractory alloys (niobium, hafnium, tungsten): for thermal linings.
* Active cooling materials: to dissipate heat through the circulation of a heat-transfer fluid.

# Optimizing performance with detonation motors

A recent innovation is rotary detonation engines, which use supersonic detonation waves to improve energy efficiency. Unlike conventional scramjets, they enable faster, more efficient combustion, reducing fuel consumption and increasing thrust. This principle could improve the overall performance of hypersonic engines, making them viable for both military and civil applications.

# Future prospects for hypersonic engines

Hypersonic engines are an active field of research, with innovations aimed at increasing their performance, reliability and energy efficiency. Current developments focus on improving supersonic combustion, reducing thermal drag and optimizing high-temperature materials.

# Aerodynamic morphing engines

One of the major breakthroughs concerns aerodynamic morphing engines. These engines use adaptive structures capable of modifying their geometry according to speed and flight conditions. The aim is to optimize airflow and combustion efficiency while reducing thermal resistance. This technology could lead to better airflow control and more stable thrust at different altitudes and speeds.

# Integration of detonation engines

Rotary and oblique detonation engines are also the subject of extensive research. Unlike conventional scramjets, these engines exploit detonation waves to generate more efficient thrust. They could increase combustion power, improve the range of hypersonic craft and enable speeds in excess of Mach 15. In 2022, China tested an engine incorporating these principles and capable of reaching Mach 16 (19,600 km/h).

# Potential applications

Hypersonic engines are being considered for both military and civilian applications:

* Hypersonic missiles: development of systems capable of maneuvering at high speed, evading defense systems.
* Rapid air transport: possibility of linking two continents in less than 2 hours.
* Access to space: integration into reusable space vehicles to reduce orbiting costs.

These innovations still require testing and validation, but they could radically transform aeronautics and astronautics over the coming decades.

Hypersonic engines, including scramjets and rotary detonation engines, represent the future of very high-speed aeronautical propulsion. Although technical challenges remain, recent advances are paving the way for potential applications in both the military and civilian fields, with considerably reduced travel times and new opportunities for space exploration.

# FEB. 10th 2025~268 New Alloys: AI Speeds Up Discovery Of Materials For Aerospace, Instruments, Electronics

[268 New Alloys: AI Speeds Up Discovery Of Materials For Aerospace, Instruments, Electronics | Scoop News](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC2502/S00017/268-new-alloys-ai-speeds-up-discovery-of-materials-for-aerospace-instruments-electronics.htm)

***The new approach was validated on two systems: five metals with high melting points and five so-called noble metals. The former included vanadium, molybdenum, NIOBIUM, tantalum, and tungsten. The latter included gold, platinum, palladium and — in this study — copper and silver. In each of these two systems, the researchers considered three elemental compositions. For example: copper and platinum; or copper, platinum, and palladium; or all five noble metals at once. Notably, the five elements making up each list tend to adopt the same crystal structure. This simplifies calculations, because the alloy is assumed to have that structure, too.***



[“Cooking Up a Perfect Metal Alloy.” Credit: Generated with DDG DaVinci2 model from prompt by Nicolas Posunko\/Skoltech](https://preview.redd.it/ypi2aeif8cie1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4d2b8fc7e7a5663c7e1bd074ebaa469db0f9093)

  
Skoltech and MIPT researchers have sped up the search for high-performance metal alloys for the aerospace industry, mechanical engineering, and electronics. The team’s machine learning-driven approach serves as a fast-track way to select promising alloy compositions for experimenters to test in labs. Without this trick, alloy modeling is so computationally demanding that materials scientists have to make educated guesses as to where the most potential lies — at the cost of neglecting hidden jewels. Reported in npj Computational Materials, the new method enables a more exhaustive search for alloy candidates. The study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation.

Pure metals often exhibit properties inferior to those of alloys of several metals, sometimes with other elements such as carbon or silicon added into the mix. By varying the composition and the ratio of the constituent elements, it is possible adjust an alloy’s characteristics: strength, malleability, melting point, corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, and so on. That way materials scientists search for new alloys with better characteristics for aerospace technology, mechanical engineering, construction, electronics, medical instruments, and more.

However, it is only after a new alloy’s characteristics have been thoroughly tested and measured in lab experiments that it gets on the radar of engineers. The trouble is such experiments are exceedingly expensive and time-consuming. What’s more, even simulated experiments exploring alloy properties require so much computing power that the search has to be constrained and cannot consider every possible option.

“The number of potential candidates is vast because so many variables are involved: what elements make up the alloy, in which proportions, what the crystal structure is, and so on,” says study co-author Professor Alexander Shapeev, who heads the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence for Materials Design at Skoltech AI. “To give you an idea, in the simplest system of two elements, say niobium and tungsten, if we consider a crystal lattice cell with 20 atoms, you’re going to have to model more than a million possible combinations, or 2 to the power of 20, not accounting for symmetry.”

The state-of-the art approaches for modeling and selecting promising alloys, including evolutionary algorithms, graph neural networks, and the particle swarm method, are good for targeted search for candidates, without going through every possible combination. But that runs the risk of missing unexpected materials with outstanding characteristics.

“The current approaches rely on a fundamental physical description of the process in terms of direct quantum mechanical calculations,” adds the lead author of the study, Skoltech MSc student Viktoriia Zinkovich from the Data Science program, who is also a BSc alumna of MIPT. “These are very precise but complex and time-consuming calculations. We, on the other hand, use machine-learned potentials, which are characterized by rapid computations and make it possible to sort through all possible combinations up to a certain cutoff limit, 20 atoms per supercell, for example. That means we won’t miss the good candidates.”

Advanced Magnet Manufacturing Begins in the United States

# ON FEB. 9th 2025 ~Rare-earths maker MP Materials leads a tiny charge against the Chinese colossus

# [Advanced Magnet Manufacturing Begins in the United States - IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/advanced-magnet-manufacturing-in-us-2671081243)

[A lab worker inspecting a rare earth magnet at MP Materials' new manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas](https://preview.redd.it/m5cv965z6die1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=540d7a5e83912abbbe05f076fc8166178d48be9c)

In mid-January, a top United States materials company announced that it had started to manufacture rare earth magnets. It was important news—there are no large U.S. makers of the neodymium magnets that underpin huge and vitally important commercial and defense industries, including electric vehicles. But it created barely a ripple during a particularly loud and stormy time in U.S. trade relations.

The press release, from [MP Materials](https://mpmaterials.com/), was light on details. The company disclosed that it had started producing the magnets, called neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB), on a “trial” basis and that the factory would begin gradually ramping up production before the end of this year. According to MP’s spokesman, Matt Sloustcher, the facility will have an initial capacity of 1,000 tonnes per annum, and has the infrastructure in place to scale up to 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes per year. The release also said that the facility, in Fort Worth, Texas, would supply magnets to General Motors and other U.S. manufacturers.

[NdFeB magnets](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-men-who-made-the-magnet-that-made-the-modern-world) are the most powerful and valuable type. They are used in motors for [electric vehicles](https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=electric+vehicles) and for heating, ventilating, and cooling (HVAC) systems, in wind-turbine generators, in tools and appliances, and in audio speakers, among other gear. They are also critical components of countless military systems and platforms, including fighter and bomber aircraft, [submarines](https://spectrum.ieee.org/submarine-stealth), precision guided weapons, night-vision systems, and radars.

# A magnet manufacturing surge fueled by Defense dollars

The Texas facility, which [MP Materials](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rare-earth-elements-2670490876) has named Independence, is not the only major rare-earth-magnet project in the U.S. Most notably, Vacuumschmelze GmbH, a magnet maker based in Hanau, Germany, has begun constructing a plant in South Carolina through a North American subsidiary, [e-VAC Magnetics](https://evac-magnetics.com/). To build the [US $500 million](https://www.plantservices.com/industry-news/news/33038696/e-vac-to-build-rare-earth-permanent-magnet-manufacturing-plant-in-south-carolina) factory, the company secured [$335 million](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2605425-e-vac-secures-335mn-for-us-permanent-magnet-plant) in outside funds, including at least $100 million from the U.S. government. (E-VAC, too, has touted a supply agreement with General Motors for its future magnets.)

In another intriguing U.S. rare-earth magnet project, [Noveon Magnetics](https://noveon.co/), in San Marcos, Texas, is currently producing what it claims are “commercial quantities” of [NdFeB magnets](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-men-who-made-the-magnet-that-made-the-modern-world). However, the company is not making the magnets in the standard way, starting with metal alloys, but rather in a unique process based on recycling the materials from discarded magnets. [USA Rare Earth](https://www.usare.com/)[announced on 8 January](https://www.mining.com/usa-rare-earth-produces-first-batch-of-magnets-at-oklahoma-plant/) that it had manufactured a small amount of NdFeB magnets at a plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

Yet another company, Quadrant Magnetics, announced in January, 2022, that it would begin construction on a $100 million NdFeB magnet factory in Louisville, Kentucky. However, 11 months later, U.S. federal agents [arrested three of the company’s top executives](http://rnal.com/story/news/local/2023/11/27/quadrant-magnetics-where-things-stand-case-alleges-company-sent-military-data-to-china/71141970007/), charging them with passing off Chinese-made magnets as locally produced and giving confidential U.S. military data to Chinese agencies.

The multiple US neodymium-magnet projects are noteworthy but even collectively they won’t make a noticeable dent in China’s dominance. “Let me give you a reality check,” says [Steve Constantinides](https://magmatllc.com/about.html), an IEEE member and magnet-industry consultant based in Honeoye, N.Y. “The total production of neo magnets was somewhere between 220 and 240 thousand tonnes in 2024,” he says, adding that 85 percent of the total, at least, was produced in China. And “the 15 percent that was not made in China was made in Japan, primarily, or in Vietnam.” (Other estimates put China’s share of the neodymium magnet market as high as 90 percent.)

But look at the figures from a different angle, suggests MP Materials’s Sloustcher. “The U.S. imports just 7,000 tonnes of NdFeB magnets per year,” he points out. “So in total, these \[U.S.\] facilities can supplant a significant percentage of U.S. imports, help re-start an industry, and scale as the production of motors and other magnet-dependent industries” returns to the United States, he argues.

And yet, it’s hard not to be a little awed by China’s supremacy. The country has some 300 manufacturers of rare-earth permanent magnets, according to Constantinides. The largest of these, [JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. Ltd](https://www.jlmag.com.cn/en/)., in Ganzhou, produced at least 25,000 tonnes of neodymium magnets last year, Constantinides figures. (The company recently announced that it was building another facility, to begin operating in 2026, that it says will bring its installed capacity to 60,000 tonnes a year.)

That 25,000 tonnes figure is comparable to the combined output of *all* of the rare-earth magnet makers that [aren’t in China](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-production-outside-asia-gearing-up-2024-preview/). The $500-million e-VAC plant being built in South Carolina, for example, is reportedly designed to produce around [1,500 tonnes](https://investornews.com/critical-minerals-rare-earths/a-landmark-moment-u-s-dept-of-defense-makes-bold-moves-in-rare-earth-magnet-manufacturing/) a year.

But even those numbers do not fully convey China’s dominance of permanent magnet manufacturing. Where ever a factory is, making neodymium magnets requires supplies of rare-earth metal, and that nearly always leads straight back to China. “Even though they only produce, say, 85 percent of the magnets, they are producing 97 percent of the metal” in the world, says Constantinides. “So the magnet manufacturers in Japan and Europe are highly dependent on the rare-earth metal coming from China.”

# MP’s Mine-to-Manufacturing stragegy

And there, at least, MP Materials may have an interesting edge. Hardly any firms, even in China, do what MP is attempting: produce finished magnets starting with ore that the company mines itself. Even large companies typically perform just one or at most two of the four major steps along the path to making a rare-earth magnet: mining the ore, refining the ore into rare-earth oxides, reducing the oxides to metals, and then, finally, using the metals to make magnets. Each step is an enormous undertaking requiring entirely different equipment, processes, knowledge, and skill sets.

[The rare earth metal produced at MP Materials’ magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, consists of mostly neodymium and praseodymium.Business Wire](https://preview.redd.it/9rbr7h5w7die1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f6f4b47a179db0cbc56087dd5fb1dd067d034c)

  
“The one advantage they get from \[doing it all\] is that they get better insights into how different markets are actually growing,” says [Stan Trout](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stantrout/), a magnet industry consultant in Denver, Colorado. “Getting the timing right on any expansion is important,” Trout adds. “And so MP should be getting that information as well as anybody, with the different plants that they have, because they interact with the market in several different ways and can really see what demand is like in real time, rather than as some projection in a forecast.”

Still, it’s going to be an uphill climb. “There are a lot of both hard and soft subsidies in the supply chain in China,” says John Ormerod, an industry consultant based in Knoxville, Tenn. “It’s going to be difficult for a US manufacturer to compete with the current price levels of Chinese-made magnets,” he concludes.

And it’s not going to get better any time soon. China’s rare-earth magnet makers are only using about 60 percent of their production capacity, according to both Constantinides and Ormerod—and yet they are continuing to build new plants. “There’s going to be roughly 500,000 tonnes of capacity by the end of this year,” says Ormerod, citing figures gathered by Singapore-based analyst [Thomas Kruemmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tkruemmer/?originalSubdomain=sg). “The demand is only about 50 percent of that.”

The upshot, all of the analysts agree, will be downward price pressure on [rare earth magnets](https://spectrum.ieee.org/search/?q=rare+earth+magnets) in the near future, at least. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Defense has made it a requirement that rare-earth magnets for its systems must be produced entirely, starting with ore, in “friendly” countries—which does not include China. “The DoD will need to pay a premium over cheaper imported magnets to establish a price floor enabling domestic U.S. producers to successfully and continuously supply the DoD,” says Constantinides.

But is what’s good for America good for General Motors, in this case? We’re all going to find out in a year or two. At the moment, few analysts are bullish on the prospect.

“The automotive industry has been extremely cost-conscious, demanding supplier price reductions of even fractions of a cent per piece,” notes Constantinides. And even the Trump administration’s tariffs are unlikely to alter the basic math of market economics, he adds. “The application of tariffs to magnets in an attempt to ‘level the playing field’ incentivizes companies to find work-arounds, such as exporting magnets from China to Malaysia or Mexico, then re-exporting from there to the USA. This is not theoretical, these work-arounds have been used for decades to avoid even the past or existing low tariff rates of about 3.5 percent.”

Amended Environmental Assessment Worksheet Submitted, Johnson to Lead External Affairs Team

Tamarack, Minnesota--(Newsfile Corp. - December 19, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) through its subsidiary Talon Nickel (USA) LLC (**""Talon""** or the **""Company""**), submitted an amended Environmental Assessment Worksheet (""**EAW**"") to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for the State's Environmental Impact Statement scoping process for the Tamarack Nickel-Copper Project, a proposed small-footprint, high-grade underground nickel mine that would be located near the City of Tamarack in Aitkin County, Minnesota (the ""**Tamarack Mining Project**"").

Talon first began the review process in June 2023 ([see the Company's press release dated June 21, 2023](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/YYg5bSknwG)). Since that time, the proposed Tamarack Mining Project has gone through two rounds of comments with the Minnesota regulatory agencies and participating tribal governments/organizations. After receiving the second round of comments on the EAW in February 2024, Talon has taken steps to investigate and propose engineered solutions to potential concerns. While this process has taken several months, the responsive engineering work underscores the Company's commitment to incorporating meaningful improvements that not only address technical requirements but also respond to broader stakeholder interests and concerns.

The amended EAW covers several key conceptual aspects of the Project for scoping.

**Consolidation of operations into a single enclosed building**

This proposed change:

* Eliminates outdoor waste rock stockpiles, significantly reducing the risk of fugitive dust outside of a controlled environment.
* Simplifies stormwater management by removing the need for extensive systems to handle outdoor contact stormwater from the Tamarack Mine Project.
* Reduces the developed footprint, which is now over 10 acres smaller than in the original design, reflecting the Company's focus on minimizing environmental impacts while maintaining operational goals.
* Significantly diminishes nighttime light pollution preserving the natural dark-sky quality of the area.
* Reduces the sound generated by future operations further limiting the project's sensory impact on the surrounding environment and community as the building serves as an effective noise barrier.

**Further proposed enhancements**

* Transitioning from a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) method that would require a looped tunnel, to a single decline ramp. This proposed change will decrease the volume of development rock generated and reduce material handling demands.
* Shifting from manifest trains to unit trains to optimize rail transportation, reducing the frequency of shipments from the site (a single unit train equates to approximately three manifest trains).

*""These proposed updates reflect Talon's ongoing commitment to listening and responding to feedback, ensuring that the Tamarack Mine Project evolves in a manner that addresses both technical requirements and the expectations of those invested in the project's success. By prioritizing environment protection, operational sustainability, and community well-being, this amended EAW underscores Talon's dedication to advancing the project responsibly,""* said Chris Wallace, Vice President of Environmental and Permitting for Talon.

Jessica Johnson, Talon's Vice President, External Affairs also stated, *""Talon is excited to continue the environmental review process, where the project design will go through further evaluation. Soon the process will encourage formal public participation through providing comments on the proposed project. These comments can further shape and refine the project design.""*

Information about the Environmental Review process is available on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources website: [Home | Minnesota DNR (state.mn.us)](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/0Vk15TbyOx)

**JESSICA JOHNSON TO LEAD EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAM**

Jessica Johnson has been promoted to Vice President, External Affairs assuming all responsibilities for all external Company engagement (media, communities and government relations). Johnson has been with Talon since 2019 and has held successive roles of responsibility in external engagement for the Company. Johnson takes over leadership of the external affairs functions from Todd Malan who is transitioning to an advisory role for the Company. Malan joined Talon in September 2021 from Rio Tinto and worked closely with Johnson to build up the external and internal capabilities, resulting in extraordinary federal government support for Talon's projects in Minnesota, Michigan and North Dakota. Cody Mayer has been promoted to Director, Tribal and Community Engagement and will report to Johnson. He will be based at Talon's mineral exploration operations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan but support tribal engagement across Talon's operations. Johnson lives proximate to the Tamarack Nickel Project and was born and raised in northern Minnesota. Mayer was born and raised in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and is an enrolled member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, a tribal sovereign government in the region.

**Table 1: Assay Results from Drill Hole 24BD0001**

* **Discovery Through Prospecting:** The Boulderdash target was identified through field prospecting, which traced mineralized boulders back to their source based on glacial ice direction and a corresponding magnetic anomaly.
* **Proximity to Existing Nickel Mine:** The target is situated just 8 miles northwest of the Eagle Nickel Mine, currently the only operating nickel mine in the U.S., owned by Lundin Mining.

*""This discovery is the result of both traditional mineral exploration practices and novel approaches to geophysics. We identified mineralized boulders at the surface while prospecting and followed the trail of boulders back to where they vanished. Then, using modern geophysical tools, we identified an anomaly, and the first drill hole hit mineralization right out of the box,""* said Dean Rossell, Chief Exploration Geologist for Talon. He added\*, ""The distribution and abundance of magmatic sulfides intersected in the initial drilling at Boulderdash bear a striking resemblance to the early drill results from the Eagle deposit. In 2001, one of the first drill holes intersected a long interval of disseminated with minor net-textured sulfides which provided some of the inspiration to drill the discovery hole in 2002 which intersected 84.2m of high-grade massive sulphide mineralization.""\* Rossell is credited with the discovery of the Eagle Deposit.

*""The recent breakthrough at Boulderdash underscores the value of Talon's in-house geology, geophysics, and drilling teams in advancing exploration in Michigan,""* said Henri van Rooyen, CEO of Talon. He continued, *""US leaders are laser focused on US dependency on critical minerals produced by foreign entities of concern. Discovery of a potential new domestic resource of copper and nickel is very timely.""*

**HISTORY OF BOULDERDASH**

The Boulderdash target, part of the Ni-Cu mineralized boulder trains in the Baraga Basin, has shown encouraging results with mineralized boulders but the source of the boulders had previously been a mystery. By combining geophysical techniques with surface prospecting, Talon was able to identify a drill target and confirm the source of mineralization with the first drill hole.

In 2022, Talon entered into an option and earn-in agreement with UPX Minerals Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sweetwater Royalties) to acquire up to an 80% ownership interest in the mineral rights over a land package comprised of approximately 400,000 acres located in the Upper Peninsula of the State of Michigan. The first hole drilled at Boulderdash is part of this land package.

James Perry, President of Sweetwater Royalties, said of the positive drill results: *""Talon continues to demonstrate their ability to identify and advance highly prospective targets of copper-nickel mineralization. Their highly experienced in-house capability in geology, drilling and geophysics make them the ideal partner to unlock the potential of our Michigan land package. We expect there is much more to come.""*

**NEXT STEPS**

Talon's Boulderdash target will be followed by additional drill holes to further evaluate the mineralized system for additional mineralization and to understand the geometry of the system. The Company will also conduct borehole electromagnetic (EM) surveys to refine the understanding of the subsurface.

**ROLAND TARGET UPDATE**

In addition to the exciting discovery at Boulderdash, Talon continues to advance exploration efforts at the Roland Target, which was drilled earlier this year. Four (4) drill holes were completed, and an off-hole electromagnetic (EM) anomaly was identified, indicating the potential for nickel and copper mineralization. Talon plans to resume exploration at the Roland Target in the 2025 drill season to follow up on the anomaly and further evaluate the target's potential.

**TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT**

Talon is committed to meaningful engagement and information sharing with tribal sovereign government's proximate to its operations (see [Talon's Tribal Engagement &amp; Consultation Statement](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/YYyWLc1rnA)).

Upon obtaining the mineral rights to the historic land package in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 2023, Talon executives sought meetings with the proximate tribal sovereign government in the region, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community (""**KBIC**"").

Before any drilling was contemplated, Talon's executive team met with tribal leadership and the KBIC professional environmental team responsible for protecting the regional environment and band members treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather in the area outside the band's reservation boundaries. Talon has shared information with Band officials since the beginning of exploration in Michigan and sought tribal knowledge regarding the exploration program.

*""Through early meetings and information sharing with KBIC officials and members, Talon has begun to better understand concerns about mineral exploration and the potential for mining in the area. We are grateful that the KBIC leadership and professional staff have shared tribal knowledge about the region's environment with us and been very clear about their concerns about the potential for mining in the region,""* said Cody Mayer, Talon's Michigan based Tribal and Community Liaison. Mayer added, *""They have also indicated that they understand the need for the energy transition and recognized that clean energy and defense systems require critical minerals like nickel and copper. We understand that the first priority for KBIC is protecting the natural environment in the region. As our mineral exploration continues, Talon is committed to keeping KBIC fully apprised of developments. Should the results ultimately point to a mineable resource, Talon is committed to seeking a consultative process with KBIC that would cover environmental concerns and also potential for economic benefit sharing.""*

Talon most recently met with the KBIC Natural Resources Advisory Committee and hosted its second community meeting at the tribal casino in Baraga, MI earlier this month.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALIFIED PERSON**

Nickel, copper, and cobalt grades were first analyzed by a 4-acid digestion and ICP AES (ME-MS61). Grades reporting greater than 0.25% Ni and/or 0.1% Cu, using ME-MS61, trigger a sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES finish (ICP81). Platinum, palladium and gold are initially analyzed by a 50g fire assay with an ICP-MS finish (PGM-MS24). Any samples reporting &gt;1g/t Pt or Pd trigger an over-limit analysis by ICP-AES finish (PGM-ICP27) and any samples reporting &gt;1g/t Au trigger an over-limit analysis by AAS (Au-AA26). The laboratory used is ALS Minerals who is independent of the Company.

Tamarack, Minnesota--(Newsfile Corp. - November 19, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF) (""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") Michigan exploration drilling has produced further positive developments in its exploration at the Boulderdash target in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. **Talon's latest 3 drill holes (24BD0002, 24BD0003, and 24BD0004) have all intersected substantial intervals of copper-nickel sulphide mineralization (assays pending).**

**Figure 1: Mineralized (copper-nickel) drill core from 69 meters depth in drill hole 24BD0003 (assays pending)**

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* Drill Hole 24BD0003: Encountered a **110.3-meter interval of mineralized (copper-nickel) intrusion from only 9.59 meters depth** and ranging in mineralization up to 40% sulphides;
* Drill Hole 24BD0004: Intersected multiple mineralized (copper-nickel) intervals, with the most notable being a **61.91-meter interval from 13.18 to 75.09 meters,** containing sulphide concentrations between 3-25%. Additional copper-nickel intervals from 105 to 116.4 meters (11.4 meters), 142.9 to 186.08 meters (43.18 meters), and 207.4 to 280.25 meters (72.85 meters) showed sulphide content ranging from 1-15%.
* Drill Hole 24BD004: Intersected copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-up clasts and copper-nickel massive sulphide veins in the core **implying that the Boulderdash intrusion has produced a copper-nickel massive sulphide body** and further drilling is required to identify the source of the massive sulphide clasts.

Brian Goldner, Chief Exploration and Operations Officer, said: *""Massive sulphide rip-up clasts and veins are an important exploration tool to gain insight into the history of the intrusion. The copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-ups tell us that the system has made copper-nickel massive sulphides in the past and is at least partially remobilizing the massive sulphides while the copper-nickel massive sulphide vein can often be used as a vector for massive sulphides. Copper-nickel massive sulphide veins often form a halo radiating away from a larger copper-nickel massive sulphide body so their presence in hole 24BD0004 is very encouraging.""*

Henri van Rooyen, Chief Executive Officer, says of the new drill results: *""Our in-house exploration and geophysics team is a cornerstone of Talon's strategy, allowing us to efficiently adapt our approach as new data emerges. With each drill hole, we gain valuable insights that guide our next steps, ensuring that we're making informed, data-driven decisions to maximize the potential of the Boulderdash target. This flexibility and responsiveness are essential as we advance our mission to develop copper and nickel resources domestically.""*

**OBSERVATION NOTES**

***Drill Hole 24BD0002*** was drilled at a shallow plunge to understand the geometry of the host ultramafic dyke, dip direction of the hanging and footwall contact. The dyke appears to have a total width of 40 to 50 meters and steeply dipping to near vertical. In comparison, the Eagle nickel-copper deposit (also in Michigan) is hosted in a similar dyke of approximately 50 meters in width.

***Drill Hole 24BD0003*** was drilled to the west of 24BD0001 (step out of 20-30 meters). The drill hole has intersected a longer interval of copper-nickel mineralization and appears to also contain a higher concentration of copper-nickel sulphides than the discovery hole 24BD0001.

***Drill Hole 24BD0004*** is a step-out hole of 30-50 meters from drill hole 24BD0001 and intersected 61 meters of 5-25% sulphides. This hole also interested the deepest copper-nickel mineralization at Boulderdash to date with net texture mineralization observed as deep as 246 meters depth indicating that the copper-nickel mineralization may extend at depth.

Additionally, drill hole 24BD0004 has shown two strong indicators of potential copper-nickel massive sulphide mineralization with copper-nickel massive sulphide rip-up clasts being observed in the intrusion and copper-nickel massive sulphide veins.

**NEXT STEPS**

Talon will continue its systematic drilling program at the Boulderdash target to define the extent of mineralization and gather data to further define its potential. Talon plans to move the rig off the dyke and drill three holes from the south to the north in order to identify the southern and northern contacts to better model the intrusion. Once this information is collected, Talon intends to model the geometry of the intrusion and drill a hole down the dyke since hole 24BD0004 has identified copper-nickel mineralization at depth.

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

[Making critical minerals available, sustainable and affordable | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/06/why-investing-in-innovation-is-essential-to-securing-critical-minerals/)

https://preview.redd.it/ginf4w6zwo8d1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7c2f704ace9728c24dee982a81f9608f951387f

* The energy transition is spurring greater demand for critical minerals, the foundation of low-carbon-energy technologies.
* Investing in innovation across the critical minerals industry could help make them more available, sustainable and affordable while supporting balanced supply and demand and enabling company- and sector-wide gains.
* By taking action today and working collaboratively, the industry, governments and investors can provide the support and financing needed to develop, scale and deploy these innovations.

Rising demand for low-carbon technologies is escalating the need for critical minerals. These technologies require more minerals than their conventional counterparts, such as coal, oil and gas, and so the transition to renewable energy is driving substantial growth in demand for critical minerals. In fact, the energy transition could [more than double](https://www.iea.org/topics/critical-minerals) the overall demand for critical minerals by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency.

To establish a secure global supply of critical minerals, materials markets must balance three priorities: availability, affordability and sustainability. This can be framed as the materials trilemma:

https://preview.redd.it/2sftaya2xo8d1.png?width=1698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a738b4bbec8a0fed56273f0c4139d594a5839d4

Collaborative action focused on the materials trilemma will secure a sustainable and affordable supply of critical minerals.

For example, transitioning new primary assets from exploration into production typically involves long lead times due to permitting, technical issues, and other challenges. Collaboration across the value chain and public sector engagement are vital to managing and reducing these lead times.

Boosting secondary (recycled) minerals supply would likewise necessitate collaborative action to increase available feedstock volumes, develop cost-effective recycling technologies, and raise [end-of-life-recycling rates](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/end-of-life-recycling-rates-for-selected-metals).

# Addressing supply and demand imbalances

Innovation will be essential to navigating the materials trilemma. At scale, new technologies and innovative business models can reduce market tightness by ramping up supply or reducing demand.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one example of an emerging technology that could support faster, more precise exploration and optimally efficient processing of critical minerals. Blockchain technology could enhance traceability in value chains to support supply, while new metal and battery recycling methods could maximize the recovery of high-quality materials.

New approaches to lowering environmental impacts in mineral production (such as closed-loop water recycling during processing) could also help address supply and demand issues. Reducing the quantity of constrained critical minerals needed for end-use energy technologies would also be beneficial, for example, by using sodium-ion batteries rather than lithium-ion batteries.

Private sector players that act now to address critical minerals supply and demand challenges in an environmentally and socially responsible manner could make vital contributions to advancing a just energy transition. While doing so, they also stand to capture the most value. For example, production process innovations that significantly reduce carbon emissions could create a [green premium](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/capturing-the-green-premium-value-from-sustainable-materials) for critical minerals because consumers will want to buy more sustainably produced materials, raising prices.

# Investing in innovation

However, investment is needed to develop, scale, and deploy innovations at the right pace. Both private and public sector actors have roles to play here.

Mining and processing companies and end-use technology manufacturers can research, develop and implement innovative processes and technologies in their own operations. They can also invest in innovative companies and market their creations for additional amplification.

For example, mining companies could boost value, efficiency, and sustainability with supply-side changes that allow them to use more low-grade ores, enhance productivity, and delay—or avoid—developing new mines. End-use technology manufacturers that reduce their reliance on critical minerals could become more resilient and better positioned to withstand potential issues within the mineral supply chain.

Financial institutions also have a role to play. Investors are essential to accelerating innovation because financing is required to develop and scale novel technologies. Venture capital (VC) and private equity firms, can also leverage their networks and expertise to help innovators scale rapidly.

Public sector investors with higher risk tolerance than their private sector counterparts can also make investments that could help attract additional private sector capital. This is especially relevant for early-stage innovations.

Finally, governments can help create an environment that supports innovation by implementing policy and funding measures to de-risk new technology development and encourage its deployment.

# Next steps

Key stakeholders can accelerate innovation in critical minerals to facilitate an orderly energy transition by taking several individual and collaborative actions.

# 1. Industry incumbents

Industry incumbents can review innovation pipelines and optimize resource allocation to scale high-impact innovations. This could include implementing innovations in-house and marketing them as new products.

These stakeholders could also build a stronger organizational culture of innovation by defining innovation as a strategic priority. This should also involve sourcing the right talent for R&amp;D efforts and adapting processes to maximize the potential of new technologies.

Established organisations can identify innovative companies to invest in, including early-stage companies with novel technologies that could impact supply or demand for critical minerals. This could happen via a VC arm or through a merger or acquisition.

# 2. Startups

Startups could identify pain points throughout the value chain where innovation might help unlock the availability, affordability and sustainability of critical minerals. They can also determine how to access the funding needed to hyperscale innovative technology.

Finally, startups could establish an organizational structure that fosters company growth, identify potential customers for a value proposition, and deploy capital effectively to produce a product.  


# 3. Financial institutions

Investors and financiers have a role to play in terms of researching and understanding the growth potential and opportunities for investment within the critical-minerals landscape. This should cover the entire industry – from innovative cleantech startups to real mining assets.

Financial institutions can also define and implement plans to support critical-minerals companies in their existing portfolios to increase their profitability, scale their products and secure widespread deployment by industry incumbents.  


# 4. Governments and other public sector actors

Finally, the public sector could identify, evaluate and implement initiatives to de-risk investment, crowd in private sector capital, and boost deployment by industry. For example, this could be done via innovation accelerators or public-private demonstration programmes.

Titanium is the ninth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, yet products based on pure titanium are uncommon because it's expensive to remove the oxygen from titanium ore. Reducing costs would encourage manufacturers to take advantage of the highly useful properties of titanium in their products.

Now, in a study [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49085-4) in *Nature Communications*, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo, have developed a procedure that reduces the cost of producing titanium that's almost entirely free of oxygen. This oxygen removal protocol might benefit technological development and environmental sustainability.

Titanium is an incredibly versatile material because not only does it typically resist chemical damage, it's strong yet light. For example, its light weight compared with other metals is why the base frame of modern iPhones consists of titanium alloy, despite the increased cost.

Unfortunately, producing ultrapure titanium is significantly more expensive than manufacturing steel (an iron alloy) and aluminum, owing to the substantial use of energy and resources in preparing high-purity titanium. Developing a cheap, easy way to prepare it—and facilitate product development for industry and common consumers—is the problem the researchers aimed to address.

""Industry mass-produces iron and aluminum metal—but not titanium metal, because of the expense of removing the oxygen from the ore,"" explains Toru H. Okabe, lead author of the study. ""We use an innovative technology based on rare-earth metals that removes oxygen from titanium to 0.02% on a per-mass basis.""

A critical step in the researchers' protocol is reacting molten titanium with yttrium metal and yttrium trifluoride or a similar substance. The end result is a low-cost, solid, de-oxygenated titanium alloy. The reacted yttrium can be recycled for further use. A highlight of the researchers' work is that even titanium scrap that contains large amounts of oxygen can be processed in this manner.

""We're excited by the versatility of our protocol,"" says Toru H. Okabe. ""The lack of intermediate compounds and straightforward procedures will facilitate adoption in industry.""

  
This work is an important step forward in making more efficient use of high-purity titanium than at present. A limitation of this work is that the resulting de-oxygenated titanium contains yttrium, up to 1% by mass; yttrium can influence the mechanical and chemical properties of titanium alloy. After solving the yttrium contamination problem, applications to industrial manufacturing will be straightforward.

***(HMM....maybe they could use a Secure, TRACEABLE, U.S. source with diversity of supply from a mine in Elk Creek?????)***  

**REPOST : AUGUST 14, 2023 \~Good morning - Jim!**

**While waiting for Niocorp’s 2023 F.S. Release… The announcement for Scandium Alloy Production &amp; Scandium alloy funding are most welcome! Leading me to add to my line of questions regarding Scandium &amp; (Niocorp).**

***A) Would Niocorp qualify for a portion of this recent funding once approved by Congress? Moving forward.***

**RESPONSE:**

**""This funding was placed in the FY24 DoD Appropriations bill at the request of Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for the purpose of helping to fund NioCorp's effort to establish domestic commercial production of AlSc master alloy.  There is always a process within the DoD to select appropriate projects with funding provided to it by Congress.  In this case, however, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees provided additional guidance to DoD on this topic in their respective National Defense Authorization bills, including prioritizing domestic production of such materials.**

""Next Question \~ For context:

**(Imperial mining, CleanTech, &amp; Scandium International all have patents on Scandium &amp; Sc aluminum alloy products. Rio Tinto has established a North American domestic supply(@15 tons/year with expansion capabilities) &amp; has established a working relationship with Boeing.**

**Niocorp has produced Scandium aluminum with both IBC (under Chris Huskamp now with Jabil) &amp; with Ames Lab, but has yet to patent any process or materials.**

**Niocorp has established a working relationship with Nanoscale to produce patentable Scandium Aluminum products in the years ahead…)**

***Jim-***

**B) How Does/will Niocorp’s expected Scandium production &amp; future patentable Scandium materials be utilized by management moving forward? Once realized…. ; and How do/would they compare to those materials &amp; alloys already developed or patented?**

**RESPONSE:**

**""Latent markets for scandium oxide and aluminum-scandium master alloy – both commercial and military -- are quite large, and we are working with a number of potential scandium consumers and related technology companies interested in scandium.  We will make announcements in this area as developments require.  In general, we don’t comment on detailed commercial business strategies except in the course of necessary announcements and/or public filings. ""**

**C) In addition to Niocorp’s collaboration with NanoScale. Is Niocorp currently working/engaged with other entities such as (Ames Lab, DoD, DoE, Chris Huskamp/Jabil &amp; others) on Scandium Materials/patents?**

**Or on Niobium, Titanium, or Rare Earth future products (Oxides, Magnets…)**

**Please comment where possible.**

**RESPONSE:**

**""There are multiple such engagements ongoing now for each product in our planned product offering. In general, we don’t comment on commercial business strategies except in the course of necessary announcements and/or public filings. ""**

**D) Are other Entities besides EXIM Bank and Stellantis still interested as possible Debt/Equity finance or Anchor Investor/s partners moving foward?**

**Leading to a Final Elk Creek Finance package?**

**RESPONSE:**

**""YES""**

# Form Your own Opinions &amp; Conclusions Above:

# I would think/speculate that the EXIM Bank would look very favorably on knowing all of the Titanium ""Tickle"" produced from the Elk Creek Mine is Locked under a 10 Year enforceable Off-Take Agreement? Along with the last 25% of Niobium, the REE's, SCANDIUM &amp; the Byproducts......  should be interesting (Pending a finance....)

# It was rumored a while back that Niocorp's Titanium -Tickle ""Might"" be a very good source of revenue moving forward.???? (T.B.D.???)

# Given everything Niocorp's Elk Creek Critical Minerals can do (including Titanium) &amp; the Need for Secure, Traceable Sources &amp; Diversity of Supply ... ""I still believe the U.S. Govt. &amp; other entities are ""Interested!

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

# SEPT. 19th 2024~ ARTICLE: Transforming aluminum to transform the world

# [Transforming aluminum to transform the world - North of 60 Mining News (miningnewsnorth.com)](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2024/09/19/critical-minerals-alliances-2o24/transforming-aluminum-to-transform-the-world/8695.html)

[Aluminum does not occur naturally in a pure form due to its reactivity. Instead, it is extracted from bauxite ore, refined into alumina, and then smelted through electrolysis. - \(Wikimedia Commons\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfhg5351kpud1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e34c9649aa677d5d1c2c7e93daffca12191482b9)

# Cutting-edge innovations turn aluminum into a cornerstone of the green transition, reshaping technology and the future.

Imagine a metal that's as light as it is strong, capable of taking cars further on a single charge and helping planes soar higher with less fuel. Enter aluminum – the unsung hero of the green revolution.

This year, aluminum isn't just playing a supporting role in the shift to sustainability; it's stealing the spotlight, driving innovations that are making our world lighter, faster, and a whole lot greener.

From electric vehicles pushing the limits of range and efficiency, to the high-capacity batteries driving them farther, and the aerospace industry's relentless pursuit of lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft, aluminum is at the core of these technological leaps. It is proving to be a game-changer, powering innovations that are shaping a sustainable future.

This versatile metal has evolved far beyond recycled soda cans, now sitting at the heart of innovations driving advancements in energy storage, transportation, and beyond. Aluminum is enabling technologies crucial for a sustainable future.

Its unique combination of strength, lightness, and recyclability makes aluminum indispensable in the race to cut carbon emissions and build a sustainable future. However, achieving a truly green aluminum industry comes with its own set of challenges.

Traditional aluminum production is energy-intensive, with smelting processes historically responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions – a challenge central to the green paradox. Balancing the demand for this versatile metal with the need to reduce its environmental footprint is a complex dilemma that the industry is only beginning to unravel.

However, recent technological advancements are beginning to shift this narrative. Innovations like carbon-free smelting, advanced batteries, cutting-edge alloys, and more are redefining aluminum's role across various industries.

Aluminum's influence spans multiple industries, particularly in automotive, where its weight-reducing properties enhance both electric and internal combustion vehicles.

By lightening the load, aluminum directly contributes to increased range for EVs and improved fuel efficiency for traditional vehicles. This is especially critical as automakers strive to meet stringent emissions targets while also catering to the growing demand for more efficient and longer-range vehicles.

Similarly in the aerospace industry, where every pound spared can result in substantial fuel savings, aluminum is an essential material.

Modern aircraft are increasingly incorporating aluminum alloys that offer a superior strength-to-weight ratio, enhancing both performance and fuel efficiency. The development of aluminum-scandium alloys, for example, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible, offering stronger, lighter components that are critical for next-generation aircraft.

As the world accelerates toward a greener future, aluminum stands out as a material that's not only adaptable and resilient but also central to the technologies driving this change. Its versatility, combined with ongoing innovations in production and application, ensures that aluminum will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable future-whether it's in the air, on the road, or beyond.

# Domestic shortcomings

In 2024, aluminum continues to be one of the most critical materials in the global push toward sustainability. With its unique properties, this metal is integral not only to automotive and aerospace industries but also to construction, consumer goods, as well as future renewables, making it a cornerstone of modern technology and infrastructure.

Feeding enough aluminum to meet the demand of these diverse industries requires a substantial supply of this increasingly critical metal. In 2023, the apparent domestic consumption of aluminum in the U.S. was around 4 million metric tons. However, this figure doesn't fully capture the total aluminum brought into the country.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.8 million metric tons of crude and semi-manufactured aluminum. With the country being 44% reliant on these imports, this data suggests that actual consumption may be higher than reported, or that a portion of the imported aluminum is being stockpiled, exported, or otherwise allocated for future use.

Regardless of the actual number, the U.S. currently operates only five primary aluminum smelters, and from those, produced around 19% of the apparent consumption last year, approximately 750,000 metric tons.

Although not as reliant as some of the other critical minerals, this limited domestic production highlights another possible vulnerability in the supply chain. As global demand for aluminum continues to grow, this dependence poses risks not only to national security but also to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions.

# Green paradox

In the world of materials science and industrial production, a complex issue known as the ""green paradox"" has long been recognized.

The green paradox refers to the irony that materials essential for advancing green technologies often come with significant environmental and social costs in their production – negating at least some of their potential benefits.

This concept is a recurring theme not just for aluminum, but for numerous critical materials like lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, copper, and nickel.

Things like EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, advanced batteries, and even the electrical grids that support renewable energy infrastructure all rely heavily on these critical minerals. Without them, the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future simply wouldn't be possible.

Despite the undeniable benefits they offer, the extraction and processing of these materials often comes at a steep environmental cost. Aluminum and copper mining are energy-intensive and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, while lithium and cobalt extraction can lead to water depletion and are strongly tinged with ethical concerns.

Hence, a paradox: they are essential for a greener future, yet their production methods are often anything but green.

# The fire

With a mix of cutting-edge technology and bold ambition, global mining company Rio Tinto is rewriting the rules of aluminum production, turning what was once an environmental risk into an opportunity for innovation by attacking aluminum production from two fronts – by revolutionizing the smelting process itself and the fuel that powers it.

Joining forces with industry leader Alcoa, Rio Tinto is addressing the challenge of carbon emissions from aluminum smelting using an innovative new technology.

Described as the most significant advancement in the aluminum industry in over a century, this technology, known as ELYSIS, replaces the traditional carbon anodes in the electrolytic cells of electric furnaces with proprietary inert anodes.

Instead of producing CO2 as a byproduct, these inert anodes release pure oxygen.

This climate-saving technology is expected to lower production costs by 15% and increase output by the same percentage. Additionally, it can be retrofitted to existing smelters or used to construct new facilities, making it versatile and scalable.

""ELYSIS is a truly disruptive technology for the industry, and it's thanks to Québec expertise that we are the first in the world to produce GHG-free aluminium,"" said Pierre Fitzgibbon, Québec Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy. ""This is a technological innovation with unprecedented benefits for our aluminium sector, which remains an undisputed world leader.""

As proof of concept, the first deployment of this technology will be built adjacent to the existing Arvida smelter, allowing the use of the current aluminum supply and casting facilities.

Supported by the governments of Canada and Québec, as well as tech giant Apple, this innovative approach to aluminum manufacturing has already been successfully demonstrated at the ELYSIS Industrial Research and Development Center in Saguenay–Lac-St-Jean.

This joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa will continue its research and development program to scale up the ELYSIS technology and has already completed the construction of larger prototype cells designed to be integrated at the end of an existing production line at Rio Tinto's Alma smelter.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.8 million metric tons of crude and semi-manufactured aluminum. With the country being 44% reliant on these imports, this data suggests that actual consumption may be higher than reported, or that a portion of the imported aluminum is being stockpiled, exported, or otherwise allocated for future use.

# Aluminum-scandium alloy

***As it stands, aluminum production is responsible for an estimated 1.1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions each year. Even as one of the world's largest aluminum producers working to reduce that number, the demand for aluminum in new and emerging technologies continues to rise.***

***NioCorp Developments Ltd., a company focused on producing critical minerals for high-tech industries, is at the forefront of developing aluminum-scandium alloy – a material that could redefine performance in automotive and defense applications, as only a small dose of scandium is needed to bolster the strength and toughness of aluminum.***

***Operating the Elk Creek critical minerals project in Nebraska, NioCorp has access to one of the richest scandium deposits in the U.S., alongside niobium, titanium, and rare earth elements.***

***Recognizing the potential of scandium for high-performance applications in the early 2010s, NioCorp has steadily developed the infrastructure and technology needed to produce an alloy that joins together the lightweight, strength, and corrosion resistance of aluminum with the exceptional durability and heat resistance of scandium.***

***Building on this foundation, NioCorp has laid out a three-phase development strategy for the aluminum-scandium master alloy more concretely around 2022. This plan set the stage for pilot-scale production to begin shortly thereafter.***

[NioCorp plans to offer a U.S. supply of aluminum-scandium master alloy for the automotive sector.](https://preview.redd.it/91dc8etkkpud1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d8776c1fa55ba278ef180a473e3872df3f09b9d)

***Collaborating closely with its development partner, Nanoscale Powders LLC, NioCorp has been refining the production process, with an eye toward reaching full-scale commercial production.***

***By late 2024, the company's effort finally bore fruit as it successfully produced scandium metal at a pilot-scale facility in Pennsylvania. This milestone not only demonstrated the feasibility of the production process but also paved the way for the creation of kilogram-sized samples of aluminum-scandium master alloy – later sent to its ""unnamed automaker partners"" for testing.***

***""The progress being made in this phased commercialization effort is important given the rapidly growing interest in scandium alloys across both the commercial transportation sector and in the national defense community,"" said NioCorp Developments Executive Chairman and CEO Mark Smith. ""This successful test demonstrates that we can make scandium metal at a high-enough purity level to proceed directly to the pilot-scale production of kilogram-sized samples of aluminum-scandium master alloy.""***

***From that success, the company remains focused on scaling production, aiming to move from 10-kilogram (22-pound) ingots to 100 kg (220 lb) ingots, ultimately targeting full-scale commercial production.***

***NioCorp's advancements in aluminum-scandium alloys not only exemplify the cutting-edge innovation driving the aluminum industry forward but also underscore the critical role that such materials will play in shaping the future of transportation and defense.***

***As the global demand for aluminum continues to surge, these innovations, alongside those from industry leaders like Rio Tinto, highlight a pivotal shift toward a more sustainable and resilient aluminum industry-one that is essential to powering the technologies of tomorrow while addressing the environmental challenges of today.***

[Through a combination of grants, tax credits, loans, and tariffs, the White House is mobilizing an all-of-government approach to establishing secure and reliable domestic critical mineral supply chains. - \(Shane Lasley for Data Mine North\)](https://preview.redd.it/1w4na5aalpud1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=292aff5d21c788c053193ee449b4881413cc3bb9)

# An all-of-government strategy is beginning to unfold in the US.

Over the first two years following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Department of Energy has invested billions of dollars into establishing a clean energy supply chain in the United States. These heavy investments, however, have neglected one vital link – the domestic mines needed to supply the processing facilities, battery plants, and other energy transition infrastructure that DOE has worked so hard to build.

Senators Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., both of which helped to author the domestic mining provisions in the BIL and IRA, are concerned that the White House's strategy is putting the U.S. in a situation where it becomes even more beholden to China and other countries for minerals and metals critical to the clean energy future.

""You've got an administration that is approaching how we deal with this with one hand deliberately tied behind our back – and we are talking about the critical minerals that go into this,"" Murkowski said while questioning DOE Deputy Secretary David Turk during a January Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on EV supply chains.

Turk indicated that DOE's hands are also tied when it comes to supporting domestic battery materials mining projects.

""We are trying to be as creative as possible with the tools and the authorities that we have got,"" the DOE deputy secretary told the committee.

The tools available to DOE were expanded with an updated guidance released in April that allows the department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) to finance domestic critical mineral mining projects under the Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program.

""The United States has substantial critical minerals resources, but we must do more if we want to lead in the mining or processing of most critical minerals. Many of the supply chains for these minerals are concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China,"" DOE wrote in a post announcing the updated Title 17 guidance. ""This raises risks for investors and businesses, eroding U.S. economic power, weakening our energy security, and increasing our reliance on unreliable foreign sources, which are often produced with lower environmental or labor standards.

Murkowski says the new guidance is a good start.

""What we need now is for the department to go beyond words, beyond funding projects that lock in long-term mineral imports from abroad, and to instead support domestic projects – in states like Alaska – that will strengthen our economy and security,"" Murkowski said.

Thus far, DOE has been reluctant to tap into the roughly $72 billion of loan guarantees available under Title 17 to support domestic mining projects. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), however, are leveraging their own authorities to bolster the first link of America's clean energy supply chain.

The DOD grants and EXIM loans are beginning to reveal an all-of-government strategy to establish complete mines-to-clean energy supply chains in the U.S.

# Strategic DOD grants

When compared to the billions of dollars DOE has poured into battery materials processing, manufacturing, and recycling, DOD's investments in domestic critical minerals projects have been relatively small but strategic.

In 2019, then-President Donald Trump authorized the Pentagon to utilize funding available under Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) – a tool established during the Cold War to ensure the U.S. could secure goods needed for national security – to support the re-establishment of a rare earths supply chain in the U.S.

Over the ensuing five years, DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic rare earth element supply chains. \*\*\*(NOTE: ARTICLE SHORTEND TO MEET REDDIT WORD LIMIT POSTING STANDARDS)

# EXIM does the heavy lifting

The Export-Import Bank of the United States has emerged as the federal government's heavy lifter when it comes to funding domestic critical mineral mining projects.

https://preview.redd.it/e9w14l6olpud1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8131d75655dd46e364931056ff52dad237aca94e

In April, the export credit agency for the U.S. government extended an offer to loan Perpetua $1.8 billion to fund the development of a mine at its Stibnite Gold project in Idaho that would provide the only domestic source of antimony critical to America's economic and national security.

The antimony to be produced as a byproduct of gold at Stibnite is of strategic interest to the Pentagon, which is why it invested nearly $60 million to advance this mine project from the start.

In a letter inviting Perpetua to submit a loan application, EXIM said the Idaho antimony project may be eligible for funding under the U.S. export bank's ""Make More in America initiative.""

The proposed EXIM loan would provide the funding to build the antimony-gold mine that the Pentagon has backed through the engineering and permitting phases.

""We are seeing a whole of government approach to bring antimony production home,"" said Perpetua Resources President and CEO Jon Cherry. ""From EXIM's potential financing of up to $1.8 billion to the multiple Department of Defense's multi-million-dollar awards to Perpetua, there is a profound recognition that we need domestic antimony production now.""

# A month after the invitation to Perpetua, EXIM offered a similar but smaller $800 million loan to NioCorp Developments Ltd. to fund the development of a mine at the Elk Creek project in Nebraska that would provide a domestic source of 17 minerals deemed critical to the U.S.

# ""Our goal is to make North America less dependent on foreign suppliers for the critical minerals we need to transition to a clean energy and less carbon-centric economy,"" says NioCorp Developments Chairman and CEO Mark Smith.

# To achieve this mission, the company plans to produce niobium and titanium, key ingredients in an emerging rapid-charging solid-state battery technology; scandium used in lightweight and durable alloys for automotive, aerospace, and defense applications; and 14 rare earths essential for numerous high-tech, military, and everyday applications.

# Global automaker Stellantis has already agreed to offtake future neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium produced at Elk Creek. These rare earths are key ingredients in the powerful magnets that go into the motors driving EVs, including electrified versions of the automaker's Jeep, Dodge, and Ram brands that are popular in North America.

# The EXIM loan would cover about two-thirds of the $1.2 billion currently estimated cost to develop Elk Creek. The total costs, however, will likely be higher with the completion of an updated feasibility study for Elk Creek that includes the recovery of rare earths, which is expected later this year.

# ****""As I see it, the stars are increasingly aligning behind our Elk Creek project and 2024 promises to be a momentous year for NioCorp,"" said Smith.******

The stars are also aligning for U.S. Strategic Metals (USSM) and the battery materials mining, processing, and mining project it is developing in neighboring Missouri.

In August, EXIM invited USSM to apply for a $400 million loan to fund the construction of a state-of-the-art plant to recover metals from concentrates and recycled lithium-ion batteries.

This potential loan will add to the nearly $230 million in funding commitments from affiliates of Appian Capital Advisory LLP announced by USSM late last year, as well as around $250 million in previous funding from Glencore and others.

""Appian is excited to partner with USSM to develop its cobalt-nickel mine and battery recycling and mineral processing operation in Missouri,"" said Appian Capital CEO Michael Sherb. ""USSM will shape the battery recycling landscape in the U.S. and play a critical role in establishing a domestic supply of essential minerals for the energy transition.""

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

https://preview.redd.it/lqrkvoy2ijvd1.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02776591de04393d335de391b4d9449808916160

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

# SEPT, 16th 2024 ~Critical titanium is on our doorstep

# [Critical titanium is on our doorstep - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/09/16/critical-minerals-alliances-2o24/critical-titanium-is-on-our-doorstep/1939.html)

[Titanium is used in many industrial applications like plates, tubes, rods, and powder. Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/dy6znxxmmjqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=272966927f85f6a392fb1226e7b0a3b5bab6ea7a)

# Reliance on imports for this white metal could darken days.

When people see something pristine white, they often think of it as pure or clean – this imagery is plastered everywhere, from unblemished lab coats to sterilized hospitals. Yet, it may be surprising to know that the rich whiteness seen in many consumer products actually comes from a critical metal, titanium.

From the whiteness of milk to the foundation used in makeup, if it is used to lighten or brighten, it most likely contains titanium.

According to the United States Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, a significant portion – an estimated 90% -- of the titanium mined each year is used to impart a stark whiteness to a wide variety of consumer goods we use every day.

""Titanium is different than most other metallic elements in that it is mined primarily to satisfy demands for a chemical product – titanium dioxide for pigment – rather than for the metal itself,"" the U.S. Geological Survey penned in a 2018 report on the luminous metal.

Despite its widespread use in consumer products, the importance of titanium extends far beyond just its whitening properties. This metal also plays a crucial role in various high-tech and strategic applications that stress its classification as a critical mineral.

# Titanium's critical role

Titanium's unique properties, such as a high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high-temperature stability, make it indispensable in multiple high-tech and strategic applications.

# Titanium's critical role

Titanium's unique properties, such as a high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and high-temperature stability, make it indispensable in multiple high-tech and strategic applications.

The aerospace industry heavily relies on titanium for aircraft structures and engines. The metal's intrinsic functions enable the production of aircraft that are both lightweight and strong, significantly improving fuel efficiency and overall performance.

In the defense sector, titanium is crucial for manufacturing similarly lightweight, strong, and corrosion-resistant components for military aircraft, naval vessels, missiles, and armor plating. This durable metal enhances the performance and longevity of basically all military equipment, making it a strategic material for national security.

Furthermore, titanium is vital in the energy sector, particularly in power generation, where its resistance to corrosion and ability to withstand high temperatures are essential for constructing power plants, offshore oil rigs, and pipelines.

The durable metal's biocompatibility also makes it a preferred material for medical implants, such as joint replacements and dental fixtures.

To appreciate titanium's critical role, it is essential to understand its journey from raw mineral to the versatile material used across various industries.

# Not just a metal

While most immediately think of solid titanium in high-performance sports equipment or large armor plating, it is actually its powdered form, known as sponge titanium, that comprises the basis of the entire titanium industry.

Sponge titanium, used to produce titanium ingots, is transformed into slab, billet, pipe, bar, plate, sheet, and other mill products. This highly volatile form of pure titanium is also used to create the beautiful flashes of white light in fireworks.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is what delivers exceptional whiteness to a wide variety of household goods and foods. It has three qualities that make it ideal for creating whiter whites – it is white, safe for human consumption, and scatters light extremely well.

""Titanium dioxide has properties for whiteness, opacity, and chemical inertness that make it especially suitable for use as a pigment to impart a durable white color to paints, paper, plastic, sunscreen, toothpaste, and wallboard,"" the USGS wrote in its 2018 titanium report.

Most high-quality white paints available today contain ""titanium white,"" a pigment made from titanium dioxide. In addition to imparting a reflectiveness and whiteness that makes rooms appear brighter, titanium dioxide increases paint's opacity, assisting in the ""one-coat cover"" touted by many manufacturers.

It is also used to make foods such as skim milk and cottage cheese whiter and creamier looking, and even to enhance the whiteness of paper.

There are very few replacements for titanium dioxide when it comes to pigments. Lead, once the ingredient of choice for white paint for nearly 2,000 years, has similar whitening qualities but is seldom used today because of its toxicity.

According to the USGS, more than 95% of titanium mineral concentrates in 2023 were consumed by domestic pigment producers.

Because it is used in such a wide variety of products, most U.S. consumers use a product containing titanium dioxide every day. However, the production and supply of titanium face significant challenges, impacting its availability and cost. Even with the high demand for titanium dioxide in consumer products and its importance in strategic applications, domestic titanium production in the United States has faced a downturn.

# Current landscape

# ***According to USGS, titanium sponge metal was produced by only one operation in the U.S. last year.

[A puck of titanium sponge, the porous form of titanium created during the initial processing of the ilmenite or rutile, crucial for producing high-performance aerospace components and consumer goods. Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/ufzzvpoymjqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d39d2d7d76c57262f19da469222cf4d9cb958ded)

This facility, operated by ATI Titanium LLC (a subsidiary of Allegheny Technologies Inc.) in Salt Lake City, Utah, has an estimated capacity of 500 tons per year and produces titanium that is further refined for use in electronics.

To give perspective, 500 tons of titanium sponge is roughly enough to manufacture the components for around 50 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, which each use approximately 10 tons of titanium.

However, the U.S. requires much more titanium annually, with estimated consumption around 40,000 tons, primarily for aerospace, defense, and industrial applications. In 2023 alone, the U.S. imported approximately 42,000 tons of titanium sponge to meet this demand, highlighting the significant reliance on foreign sources despite the high domestic need.

At one point, two other facilities held a combined capacity of roughly 23,500 tons, enough to support more than half of the country's needs, but these facilities have since been in an idled status since 2016 and 2020, respectively.

The idling of these facilities, operated by TIMET (Titanium Metals Corporation) in Henderson, Nevada, and another in Rowley, Utah, by ATI Titanium, reflects the broader challenges faced by the domestic titanium industry, including fluctuating market conditions, high operational costs, and competition from foreign producers.

Recognizing the strategic importance of titanium, the U.S. government has taken steps to support the domestic industry. The Department of Defense, for example, has invested in several projects to ensure a reliable supply of titanium for military applications.

In recent years, the Defense Production Act Title III has been invoked to bolster domestic production of critical minerals, including titanium. This act provides funding for the development of new extraction and processing technologies and offers incentives for companies to expand their production capabilities.

Additionally, the National Defense Stockpile (NDS) program has been leveraged to maintain reserves of titanium sponge and other critical materials to mitigate supply chain disruptions.

While these initiatives are vital for addressing immediate supply chain vulnerabilities, long-term sustainability of the titanium supply also hinges on expanding domestic mining and production capabilities.

Efforts are underway to develop new titanium mines and production facilities across North America, aiming to reduce dependency on foreign sources and enhance the resilience of the supply chain.

# North America has titanium

From the western reaches of Alaska to the far east of Quebec in Canada, numerous locations of possible iron-rich deposits have been recorded, and where there is iron, there is a good chance there is the titanium mineral ilmenite. Additionally, the continental U.S., including regions in Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, hosts significant potential titanium stores, with heavy mineral sand deposits rich in titanium.

[Rutile, a titanium-rich mineral, is essential for producing titanium dioxide, widely used in paints, plastics, and paper. Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/6ppchvt6njqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42ed72dd5887fe7f588e531e59568a78a47938de)

Titanium mining involves extracting the two primary titanium-bearing minerals ilmenite and rutile, which are typically found in heavy mineral sand deposits along coastlines or in hard rock deposits inland.

Mining operations generally use surface techniques like open-pit mining and dredging to excavate these minerals, which are then processed through gravity and magnetic separation methods to isolate the titanium minerals from other materials. The resulting titanium concentrate is further refined to produce titanium dioxide or titanium sponge.

A 2016 report by the Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) identified the potential for critical minerals-enriched marine placers approximately 100 miles northwest of Nome, at the western tip of the Seward Peninsula. The report concludes that sedimentary processes in the Bering Strait could create heavy-mineral placers containing titanium, zirconium, rare earth elements, and minor quantities of tin, tungsten, niobium, and precious metals.

""We conclude that sedimentary processes in the Bering Strait are present that could create heavy-mineral placers containing minerals with titanium, zirconium, and rare earth elements plus minor tin, tungsten, niobium, and precious metals,"" DGGS penned in its report.

The beaches of Nome are not the only Alaskan sites rich in titanium. The Kemuk prospect, located further south, is believed to contain a vast lode of titanium. Initial work by Humble Oil Company estimated that Kemuk holds 2.4 billion tons of material averaging 15 to 17% iron, alongside significant titanium and silicon deposits.

Millrock Resources Inc. revisited the Kemuk project in 2010 but focused less on titanium and iron and more on the potentially larger copper deposit indicated by the area's mineralization.

As for America's northern neighbor, Canada produced approximately 500,000 metric tons of titanium mineral concentrates in 2023. This represents a decrease from previous years, attributed to a decline in global demand and reduced production capacity in some mines. Despite this decline, Canada continues to play a significant role as a leading producer of titanium in North America, reflecting its importance in the global titanium supply chain.

Most of the titanium comes from Rio Tinto's Lac Tio mine near Havre-Saint-Pierre, Quebec, home to the largest ilmenite deposit in the world, positioning Canada to be well-equipped to circumvent national security issues and provide a North American supply chain.

Alongside its impressive titanium capability, Rio Tinto is also addressing scandium supply risks by extracting high-purity scandium from the waste streams of its aluminum production at the Sorel-Tracy plant in Quebec.

America's southeastern states of Florida and Georgia host rich coastal heavy mineral sand deposits that could help reduce foreign reliance.

In 2020, Chemours Titanium Technologies, one of the world's largest producers of titanium dioxide, invested approximately $86 million into a heavy mineral sand project in Georgia. This project is currently producing titanium, zircon, and rare earth elements, marking a significant step toward enhancing domestic titanium production.

Other players that are contributing to a future titanium supply include IperionX, which is developing the Titan Project in Tennessee and aims to become a leading supplier of low-carbon titanium.

While a potential ally in Greenland, Bluejay Mining plc, is advancing the Dundas Ilmenite Project, considered the one of the world's highest-grade ilmenite projects, could also become a vital source for North America.

With these developments, despite the current challenges, there are promising solutions on the horizon to mitigate the risk associated with this critical white metal. This progress highlights a step toward reducing reliance on foreign sources, although that still leaves 49 other critical minerals and metals to address.

# Import-reliance a top concern for national security officials.

America's heavy reliance on China and others for the minerals and metals critical to the nation's economic competitiveness, military strength, and clean energy future is high on the list of strategic concerns for top brass at the U.S. departments of Defense and Homeland Security.

While much of this concern is rooted in the fact that the United States' ability to defend its strategic interests at home and abroad would be severely crippled if China decides to cut supplies of the mined materials critical to a prolonged and high-tech war, the departments charged with America's security understand that there are much more fundamental reasons to become more self-reliant when it comes to the minerals that are the first link to nearly every American supply chain.

""Economic competitiveness is a national security issue,"" Tim Moughon, director of field intelligence at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said during a presentation at the American Exploration &amp; Mining Association conference last December.

The raw materials foundation of America's economic competitiveness, however, eroded with a globalization strategy that favored inexpensive imports over supporting domestic supply chains. China, which can mine and manufacture goods much cheaper due to lower labor costs and environmental standards, has been happy to be the low-cost supplier of these goods and, at the same time, gain dominance in many of the world's supply chains.

""Over three decades the People's Republic of China became the global industrial powerhouse in many key areas – from shipbuilding to critical minerals to microelectronics – that vastly exceeds the capacity of not just the United States, but the combined output of our key European and Asian allies as well,"" the U.S. Department of Defense penned in its inaugural National Defense Industrial Strategy published in January.

""Our ability to maintain our way of life, our ability to maintain our position in the world, our ability to fund our physical security – all of these things are dependent on a strong and robust economy,"" Moughon informed mining leaders gathered in Reno last December. ""The mining sector is critically important in this respect.""

Moughon's message was reinforced by an article penned by Joe Buccino, a retired U.S. Army colonel who served as the communications director for U.S. Central Command from 2021 to 2023, in a column published by RealClear Defense shortly after the Department of Homeland Security's presentation at the annual mining event.

""Establishing a fully domestic mineral supply chain, stretching from mining operations to the final market, is essential for ensuring security for long-term competition with China,"" Buccino wrote.

# America's critical minerals myopia

The 2024 edition of U.S. Geological Survey's annual Mineral Commodity Summaries underscores the extent that America has traded its critically important mining sector in exchange for cheap goods from China and others.

According to the report published in January, the U.S. relies on imports for more than half its supply of 49 minerals that serve as foundational inputs to nearly every sector of the American economy and is 100% dependent on imports for 15 of them.

""Our mineral import dependence continues to be a gaping hole in our economic and national security and we're clearly not moving fast enough to course correct,"" National Mining Association President and CEO Rich Nolan said upon the release of USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024.

This gaping hole includes being net-import reliant for 29 out of the 50 minerals that have been deemed critical to America's economy and security, including 100% dependent on other countries for 12 of them.

https://preview.redd.it/4wlw9op0ljqd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc242ab59a581f583d9ac0ea47845efd8884b23

# China is the leading producer of 30 of the minerals critical to the United States, including the ones highlighted in this infographic.

https://preview.redd.it/zduqgyicljqd1.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a123cde02662c5c8bef3186fabcb08473bfcf1d9

While rare earths are a prime example, they are not the only critical minerals for which America's shortsightedness has resulted in a heavy dependence on China for its supply.

The list of critical minerals for which China is a top supplier includes:

***• Gallium, the U.S. relies on imports for 100% of its supply of this semiconductor used in next-generation smartphones, telecommunication networks, and solar technologies.***

***• Graphite, the U.S. relies on imports for 100% of its supply of this mined material that is currently the single largest ingredient in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.***

***• Manganese, the U.S. relies on imports for 100% of its supply of this mined material needed for steelmaking and in the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries.***

***• Niobium, the U.S. relies on imports for 100% of its supply of this metal essential to heat-resistant superalloys for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector.***

***• Titanium, the U.S. relies on imports for 95% of its supply of this light yet strong metal used in aerospace alloys, sports equipment, and now the Apple iPhone 15 Pro.***

***• Platinum, the U.S. relies on imports for 83% of its supply of this precious metal used as a catalyst to scrub pollutants from industrial and automotive emissions.***

***• Antimony, the U.S. relies on imports for 83% of its supply of this metalloid with a wide variety of civilian and defense applications and a top concern of the U.S. military.***

Department of Homeland Security says China's dominance in the global supply of these and several other critical minerals can be used as an economic and geopolitical tool.

""With this monopoly power comes tremendous ability to target adversaries and to use this economic position to shape the behavior of other governments,"" Moughon said.

# Monopoly not hypothetical

China's ability and willingness to leverage its critical minerals dominance as a geopolitical tool and trade war weapon is not hypothetical.

Back in 2010, the communist country severely restricted rare earth exports as a means of punishing Japan during a dispute over the sovereignty of islands in the South China Sea.

As a result, the prices for these elements skyrocketed, and a global rush to discover and develop deposits outside of China erupted. At the height of this frenzy, China flooded the markets with rare earths it had been stockpiling during the embargo – driving many hopeful rare earth companies out of business and providing the communist nation an excellent opportunity to buy distressed rare earth assets around the globe at a discount.

In recent years, China has further solidified its control of critical mineral assets beyond its borders through the Belts and Road Initiative, a strategy to build up infrastructure in developing nations in exchange for ownership of mining projects.

""It is a great example of the Chinese government's efforts to go out and buy up critical minerals, critical resources. China has become the largest bidirectional lender in Africa in recent years,"" said Moughon.

The US-China Economic and Security Review Commission estimates that China has loaned 15 African nations a combined $140.6 billion under what some are calling the Chinese debt trap.

""China is also very involved with many of these enterprises – essentially, state-owned monopolies that can invest in the space, but invest in the space at a discount,"" the commission wrote.

The control over so many mining assets within and without its borders, coupled with state-owned mining companies that can forego healthy profits from mining in favor of the value-added products, strengthens China's monopolization of global critical mineral supplies along with the high-tech, clean energy, and other sectors they support.

With control of the upper end of the supply chain, China bolsters its economy and national security by upgrading critical minerals into higher-value products used in electric vehicles, high-tech electronics, military hardware, and an enormous array of consumer goods.

""The government of China has a critical position now in the critical minerals space, they dominate the market for processing critical minerals, from ore to refined products,"" said Moughon. ""They use these products in both intermediate goods and then in finished goods.""

In 2023, the communist government again leveraged its dominance by placing state-controlled restrictions on the exports of gallium, germanium, and graphite. All three of these mined materials are critical to the clean energy and tech sectors and, by extension, national security.

Hitting even closer to home when it comes to minerals critical to national security, China has placed similar restrictions on exports of antimony, a metalloid that is vital to manufacturing military communication equipment, night vision goggles, and ammunition.

China's Ministry of Commerce said the government controls on antimony exports, which went into effect on Sept. 15, are required ""to safeguard national security and interests, and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation.""

""So, these aren't hypotheticals,"" said Moughon. ""We see adversaries use monopolistic power very intentionally to advance their own national interests.""

# Concentrated energy supply chains

The enormous quantities of minerals required to build a green energy future in the U.S. add another layer of urgency to the need to develop domestic critical mineral supplies.

In a report published earlier this year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that an additional $800 billion needs to be invested in mining by 2040 to achieve net-zero emissions goals by mid-century.

""The world's appetite for technologies such as solar panels, electric cars and batteries is growing fast – but we cannot satisfy it without reliable and expanding supplies of critical minerals,"" said International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol.

In addition to expanding the volume of energy transition minerals entering global supply chains, IEA emphasized the need to diversify where that supply is coming from in order to curb the supply and geopolitical risks associated with the current overreliance on a handful of producing countries.

""Between now and 2030, some 70-75% of projected supply growth for refined lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements comes from today's top three producers,"" the agency penned in its new report.

# Mission critical minerals

***""A resilient energetics supply chain will help ensure our warfighters are ready for any conflict, while reducing our nation's reliance on foreign sources,"" said Mike Diggins, senior vice president and homeland and force protection business area leader at Leidos. ""Our team will help the DOD synthesize and scale-up domestic minerals and materials production.""***

***A mission that is increasingly critical to the Pentagon.***

***""It is critical that we shore up reliable and sustainable domestic supplies of strategic materials,"" said Taylor-Kale.***

With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

https://preview.redd.it/0wxs36o1ijvd1.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db785f21bc23e8cac96b6a42630d7ed2db1fba2f

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Energy reshift
BP (BP) is scaling back its energy transition strategy and will drop its ambitious target of cutting oil and gas production by 2030, with plans to raise its output instead, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. This would mark a major shift for the oil giant at a time when its plan to boost renewables has raised concerns over profitability.

Strategy pivot: Back in 2020, BP pledged to cut oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, widely seen as the sector's most ambitious target. This was scaled back last year to a 25% cut. But now, BP is looking to increase its oil and gas production, eyeing investments in three new projects in Iraq and in re-developing oilfields in Kuwait. It is moving ahead with the development of oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and is also weighing acquiring assets in the Permian Basin.

Prioritizing profits: BP has paused investment in new offshore wind and biofuel projects in recent months, and reduced the number of low-carbon hydrogen projects to 10 from 30. The move comes as clean energy projects are facing supply chain issues and rising costs amid higher interest rates. Recall that BP is targeting $2B cost savings by 2026-end. While the updated strategy is expected to be unveiled in February, the company has already dropped the 2030 production cut target in practice.

Not alone: Rival Shell (SHEL) has also scaled back its energy transition strategy this year, scrapping several renewable energy projects and exiting power businesses to refocus efforts on oil and gas. In other news, the British energy giant on Monday raised its production guidance for LNG as well as upstream oil and gas. (10 comments)

859,1ffw8wq,"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",Professional_Disk131,/r/Canadapennystocks/comments/1ffw8wq/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadapennystocks/comments/1ffw8wq/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,1,1,1726238048.0,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

The Senate Armed Services Committee joined with its House counterpart to authorize spending for a pair of Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine as part of the Fiscal Year 2025 defense policy bill, the panel announced today.  
Adding the second boat is a break from the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2025 budget, which called for a single Virginia-class submarine and a boost to the submarine industrial base to meet the goal of delivering two attack submarines per year and meet the delivery schedule for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine.

“I’m glad that the committee came together this year to pass a bill that makes critical investments to support our defense industrial base workforce and shipbuilding programs, including the Virginia-class submarine program to help ensure we meet our commitments through the Australia-U.K.-U.S. agreement,” reads a statement from SASC sea power chair Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).

The two-boat buy is a break from the House Appropriations Committee’s bill that only called for a single boat.

The HAC defense subcommittee’s chair, Rep Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), told *Bloomberg* earlier this month he didn’t believe that submarine builders General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII could meet the two-per-year cadence.

“I’m in favor of building three submarines a year,” Calvert said. “It’s our strategic advantage to do so. The problem is the industrial base, the primes, the subs, are not capable of building more than one submarine a year. That is just a fact. It’s just a fact we have to deal with. I wish it wasn’t so.”

In addition to HAC-D, the White House earlier this week also pushed back against a second sub buy [in a memo to the HASC](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/12/white-house-memo-on-hasc-fy-2025-defense-bill).

“Further, the Administration strongly opposes … incremental funding of a second Virginia Class Submarine in FY 2025, which industry is unable to produce on schedule,” the White House wrote in a memo responding to the HASC bill.

The split on the Virginias between the authorizers, appropriators and the administration is set to be one of the largest issues to sort out in the shipbuilding budget.

In addition to the extra boat, the SASC authorized an additional $1.43 billion to build a third Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyer.

The legislation also expresses concern over the ship design maturity, restricting to funds pending reports from the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Specifically, the SASC singled out the Landing Ship Medium and the Constellation-class guided-missile frigate.

“\[The bill\] prohibits lead ship construction for the Landing Ship Medium pending certification of design completion and authorizes the procurement or chartering of a minimally-modified commercial or non-developmental landing ship that meets core Marine Corps sealift and beach landing requirements,” reads the executive summary of the bill.  
“\[The bill\] fences Fiscal Year 2025 funds for Constellation-class frigate construction pending DoD certification relating to design completion.”

Earlier this year, the Navy announced that the lead ship in the Constellation-class was an estimated three years behind schedule and that the detail design is still incomplete.

Overall, the bill adds an additional $25 billion to the Pentagon budget request for a total of $878.4 billion. The bill left committee with a 22-3 vote that included a “nay” from SASC chair Sen. Jack Reed (D- R.I.) for breaking spending caps set in place by the Fiscal Responsibility Act.

The proposed SASC National Defense Authorization Act comes in parallel with a new overall spending plan by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) that calls for a $55 billion boost in defense funding for FY 2025 and an overall increase to about five percent of the U.S. gross domestic product.

In a Friday statement, Senate majority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the proposed increase in defense spending would either mean repealing FRA or crafting a new budget deal.

“In that case, Democrats are committed to ensuring an equitable increase in our domestic investments alongside an increase in defense spending,” reads the statement.

**While waiting for Niocorp’s 2023 F.S. Release… The announcement for Scandium Alloy Production &amp; Scandium alloy funding are most welcome! Leading me to add to my line of questions regarding Scandium &amp; (Niocorp).**

***A) Would Niocorp qualify for a portion of this recent funding once approved by Congress? Moving forward.***

**RESPONSE:**

# ""This funding was placed in the FY24 DoD Appropriations bill at the request of Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for the purpose of helping to fund NioCorp's effort to establish domestic commercial production of AlSc master alloy.  There is always a process within the DoD to select appropriate projects with funding provided to it by Congress.  In this case, however, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees provided additional guidance to DoD on this topic in their respective National Defense Authorization bills, including prioritizing domestic production of such materials.

""Next Question \~ For context:

**(Imperial mining, CleanTech, &amp; Scandium International all have patents on Scandium &amp; Sc aluminum alloy products. Rio Tinto has established a North American domestic supply(@15 tons/year with expansion capabilities) &amp; has established a working relationship with Boeing.**

**Niocorp has produced Scandium aluminum with both IBC (under Chris Huskamp now with Jabil) &amp; with Ames Lab, but has yet to patent any process or materials.**

**Niocorp has established a working relationship with Nanoscale to produce patentable Scandium Aluminum products in the years ahead…)**

[NioCorp \(Nasdaq:NB\) is pleased to announce that it has engaged JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to assist NioCorp in seeking debt financing supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. to advance NioCorp’s proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project.](https://preview.redd.it/jl299eihg57d1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db589100b18f894b33b04f13728333215bfb4a9)

NioCorp’s application for project financing with EXIM made it through the first of EXIM’s three Transaction Review Committee (“**TRC**“) reviews in October 2023.  In April 2024, EXIM provided NioCorp with a preliminary indicative term sheet for possible financing. While JPMorgan is assisting the Company to advance the sought financing to the next level in the EXIM approval process, no loan application is final until EXIM’s Board of Directors give its final approval.

“With J.P. Morgan’s experience in helping to successfully craft financing packages with EXIM, we are very pleased to be working with them to continue to push our Elk Creek Project to financing and a construction start as rapidly as possible,” said Mark A. Smith, CEO and Chairman of NioCorp.

**VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / September 4, 2024 /** **Arras Minerals Corp. (TSXV:ARK)(OTCQB:ARRKF) (""Arras"" or ""the Company"")** is pleased to provide an update on its exploration activities underway across the project portfolio in NE Kazakhstan.

**Highlights**

* 3,547 line-kilometer Heli-TEM survey over the entire 1397 square-kilometer Bozshakol project mineral tenement package announced July 22, 2024 has now been completed
* KGK Drill program underway at Aktasty and Maisor licenses (Bozshakol project) targeting high-priority areas to test bedrock under 10-40 m of unconsolidated cover
* Ground IP Survey at Elemes project is now 80% completed, high priority targets identified, core drill program now underway at Berezski East and Berezski Central targets
* KGK Drill program at Tay project completed

https://preview.redd.it/t2mhsnscxqqd1.jpg?width=826&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=457b8de779907bdd12b8c1d8a7a11d46486ccaf7

**Bozshakol Project:**

The Bozshakol Project (Package ""A"" in Figure 1) is located 56km to the northwest of the town of Ekibastuz and surrounds and covers the potential continuation of mineralization of KAZ Minerals' Bozshakol copper- mine.

The Heli-Tem survey announced on July 22 nd has now been completed. Analysis of data is underway. A 17,000-meter KGK drill program has commenced at the Aktasty and Maisor licenses to test the bedrock at targets identified through geophysics and soil sampling completed to date, and to better understand the subsurface geology that lays below 10-40 m of quaternary cover. This program, along with the Heli-Tem survey is expected to inform on priority drill targets for 2025.

**Elemes Project:**

The Ground IP Survey at the Elemes project which commenced in July is approximately 80% complete and expected to be finished in September. The survey over the Berezski East and Berezski Central target areas has been completed and drill targets for these areas prioritized. A core drill is now underway at these areas with drilling at the Elemes Project expected to continue across a number of priority targets into November with 5000m planned for this Phase I program. Initial assays are expected in November.

https://preview.redd.it/pnz4ghtcxqqd1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883d2c68c753069f9b7e107ab0d0164f01c07370

**Tay Project:**

A 5,424m KGK drilling program has been completed at the Tay Project. This program targeted the Soviet-era IP anomaly that formed the basis to acquire the license earlier this year. The 135 KGK holes successfully tested the top of bedrock across the anomaly returning predominantly basalts and schists.

Following completion of the KGK program, a single line of Ground IP survey was undertaken which confirmed the location of the Soviet IP anomaly with inversion analysis indicating an anomaly at approximately 140m below surface. Given the KGK drill is not able to reach that depth, a single core hole was drilled to test the heart of the anomaly and was drilled to 400 m. Visual results from the hole indicate several zones of chalcopyrite mineralization along fractures within basalts and gabbros. Priority intervals have been dispatched to the assay lab with results expected in October.

**Tim Barry, CEO commented,** ""We are very pleased with how the programs are progressing so far this summer with activity across virtually the entire license package. The Ground IP survey at Elemes has progressed well and we are excited to have a drill turning there now as we begin to test the first batch of new priority targets at this exciting project. Additionally, all the work taking place at the Bozshakol group is advancing this project area to prioritize drill targets and follow-up areas ahead of an expected busy drilling campaign in 2025. At Tay, while we are awaiting assay results, we were surprised to not see more intensive alteration and sulfides in the drill core given how well the IP anomaly was confirmed with our own Ground IP survey. Once assays are received, we will review and decide on next steps at Tay.""

862,1ffw89x,"An Overview of Element79 Gold (CSE:ELEM, OTC:ELMGF)",Professional_Disk131,/r/CanadaStocks/comments/1ffw89x/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaStocks/comments/1ffw89x/an_overview_of_element79_gold_cseelem_otcelmgf/,2,0,1726238001.0,"In this article, I’ll walk you through Element79 Gold’s strategic position in the rapidly rising gold market, where prices have surged by about 20% this year. With even higher prices predicted, Element79 is well-prepared to take advantage of this favorable environment through its near-term production projects and exciting long-term exploration prospects. I’ll delve into the company’s key assets, including the Lucero mine and its Nevada portfolio, and explain how its experienced leadership team is driving growth and sustainability. I’ll also highlight Element79’s recent uplisting to the OTCQB Venture Market, a move designed to attract a wider range of investors and enhance market visibility.

Gold has surged by about 20% this year, outpacing even US tech stocks. Bank of America’s investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, suggests that investors should consider buying gold, despite its near-record high prices. He points to upcoming potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which could reignite inflation in 2024. Historically, real assets like gold have performed well in inflationary periods, making it an attractive investment.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pt4n96xq7lod1.jpg?width=1401&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d1b202dc9b2071cee8f24c05ef593af7817b9bf

Interestingly, while gold has seen significant gains, it has also experienced $2.5 billion in net outflows, suggesting that investors are taking profits. Hartnett attributes the continued strength in gold prices to central bank purchases, particularly from China’s central bank, the largest buyer in 2023. He highlights that gold is now the second-largest global reserve asset, with a low correlation to other assets like stocks, adding to its appeal as a hedge.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) is a Canadian-based mining company that is making significant strides in the precious metals industry, with a focus on gold and silver. Through a combination of near-term production potential and long-term exploration projects, the company is positioned to generate immediate revenue while continuing to explore untapped resources. Element79’s flagship project, the Lucero mine, is expected to resume production soon, while exploration activities in Nevada provide further growth potential​.

The Lucero Mine, situated in Peru, is renowned as one of the country’s highest-grade underground gold mines in history. A past producer, Lucero was famous for its exceptionally rich deposits, averaging a gold equivalent grade of 19.0 grams per ton (14.0 g/t of gold and 373 g/t of silver). During its last five years of operation, which ended in 2005, the mine produced approximately 40,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually. These high-grade results established Lucero as a key asset in the region, known for its reliability in delivering significant gold and silver outputs. The mine’s underground workings extend over 16 kilometers, showcasing the scale and depth of its mineral reserves.

In 2023, fresh assays and channel samples from Lucero’s underground workings confirmed the potential for a new high-grade mining phase. The samples yielded up to 11.7 ounces (374.4 g/t) of gold per ton and 247 ounces (7,904 g/t) of silver per ton, significantly validating the possibility of renewed operations. With over 600 new samples feeding into a 2024 drill plan, Lucero’s underground workings hold the promise of substantial future production.

Since acquiring a portfolio of 16 Nevada projects from Waterton Global Resource Management in December 2021, Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS) has strategically managed and optimized its assets to maximize shareholder value. After reviewing and expanding historical data sets, the company divested several projects, including Stargo and Long Peak, which were sold to Centra in 2023. A 43-101 report for Long Peak is expected in late summer 2024. Element79 chose not to renew claims on eight early-stage projects but retained data rooms for potential future value.

The Maverick Springs project, initially purchased with a 1.8M oz AuEq historical resource, was reviewed and reworked, increasing its Mineral Resource Estimate to 3.71Moz AuEq. Maverick Springs was sold to Sun Silver in May 2024, with proceeds used to pay off debts while retaining 3.5 million shares in Sun Silver Limited as a long-term investment. Additionally, the Valdo portfolio is under negotiation, with an expected sale closing in 2024, while Clover and West Whistler are also under review, with discussions ongoing for potential sales.

Element79 Gold (CSE: ELEM) (OTC: ELMGF) (FSE: 7YS)’s narrative becomes even more compelling with gold (Au) prices near all-time highs, currently hovering around $2,420/oz. With many investment banks forecasting gold prices between $2,500 and $3,000/oz. by 2025, the timing of Element79’s near-term production projects positions the company to capitalize on this bullish market. Companies that enter production sooner will stand to benefit significantly from the anticipated surge in gold prices, increasing their value and potential returns for investors. Element79’s strategy to expedite production aligns perfectly with this favorable market outlook.",UTC,Unknown,2025-10-14T03:46:37.362045,2024-09-14T00:33:21,Rio Tinto,2024
