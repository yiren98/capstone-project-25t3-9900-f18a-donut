  "overview": "This subtheme captures how companies engage with external stakeholders like local communities, Indigenous groups, and regulatory bodies. It focuses on cooperative efforts in environmental management, cultural heritage protection, and collaborative governance. It matters because it demonstrates a company's commitment to shared responsibility and ethical partnership beyond its immediate operations.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Positive sentiment dominates, with mentions of active collaboration on environmental and heritage projects",
    "Examples include joint monitoring of mining impacts, co-management of rehabilitation efforts, and financial cooperation in cleanup projects",
    "Engagement ranges from logistical support (e.g., flight points for remote workers) to high-stakes regulatory collaboration",
    "Strong emphasis on transparency and consent-seeking in partnerships with Indigenous communities"

  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments and reports typically appear in contexts where companies are addressing historical legacies, environmental impacts, or regulatory expectations. They often respond to external scrutiny or partnership opportunities.",
    "The narrative often surfaces when companies and communities have overlapping interests in land use, cultural preservation, or environmental remediation. It's triggered by joint projects, regulatory requirements, or public accountability mechanisms.",
    "This subtheme interacts strongly with corporate responsibility, stakeholder engagement, and regulatory compliance. It's closely tied to transparency and willingness to share control or decision-making."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Risk of 'cooperation' becoming purely performative. Without genuine commitment, collaborative projects can mask power imbalances where communities bear the burden of monitoring or follow-up.",
    "Over-reliance on process (e.g., setting up committees, conducting studies) without proportional investment in outcomes. Communities notice when collaboration doesn't lead to tangible improvements.",
    "Fragmentation in partnership approaches. Different departments or teams may engage with the same community in uncoordinated ways, reducing overall effectiveness and trust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute formal partnership frameworks with clear terms, especially for long-term projects like mine rehabilitation or cultural heritage protection. Ensure Indigenous groups have real decision-making power, not just advisory roles.",
    "Develop transparent, multi-year investment plans for community-led initiatives (e.g., environmental monitoring, cultural centers) that are not tied to individual projects or tax incentives. This creates more sustainable engagement.",
    "Create organizational incentives for departments to share learnings and align their community engagement strategies. Avoid siloed initiatives by creating cross-functional oversight for community relationships."
