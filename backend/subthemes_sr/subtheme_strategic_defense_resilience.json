  "typical_contexts": [
    "The discourse arises when the company's strategic moves (e.g., mergers, partnerships, lobbying) are scrutinized publicly, especially when they intersect with global issues like climate change, trade tensions, or ethical sourcing.",
    "It often appears in critiques or endorsements of the company's role in supply chain security, energy transition, and ethical governance, particularly from NGOs, industry analysts, and shareholders.",
    "It interacts with dimensions like Agility (via rapid strategic shifts) and Performance (via financial or operational outcomes), often in contexts requiring defense of decisions or demonstration of resilience."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Over-focus on strategic positioning (e.g., securing resources) may obscure underlying ethical risks, such as engagement with controversial regimes or industries, leading to reputational damage.",
    "Inconsistency between public commitments (e.g., climate goals) and actual lobbying activities or partnerships can erode trust and expose the company to activist pressure.",
    "The complexity of global supply chains can create blind spots where local or secondary impacts (e.g., environmental, social) are underestimated, leading to reactive rather than proactive management."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish a transparent framework for evaluating and communicating strategic decisions, especially those with ethical dimensions, to preempt external criticism and align with stated values.",
    "Implement robust due diligence processes for partnerships and lobbying activities, ensuring they align with both strategic goals and public commitments, particularly on climate and human rights.",
    "Enhance stakeholder engagement mechanisms, especially with NGOs and industry watchdogs, to proactively address concerns and demonstrate commitment beyond compliance."
