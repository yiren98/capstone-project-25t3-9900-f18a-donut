  "overview": "This subtheme focuses on the experiences and perceptions of unfair treatment, discrimination, and harassment within the workplace. It is a critical component of corporate culture as it directly impacts employee safety, well-being, and sense of belonging, which in turn affects retention, productivity, and overall company reputation.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Reports of systemic or widespread harassment and discrimination",
    "Mentions of specific types of discrimination (e.g., sexual harassment, racism)",
    "Experiences shared by employees (or former employees) as victims",
    "External validation or investigation confirming internal reports"
  ],
  "sentiment_snapshot": {
    "positive": 0,
    "negative": 1,
    "average_confidence": 1.0
  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Emerges in contexts where employees are sharing their experiences, often in internal surveys, external reviews, or whistleblower reports.",
    "Appears in discourse when the company's public image is being contrasted with internal realities, often during crises or scandals.",
    "Interacts strongly with dimensions of 'Transparency' and 'Accountability', as the presence of these reports indicates a failure in systems to prevent or address such issues."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Ignoring or underinvesting in these reports leads to a toxic culture, high attrition, and public scandals.",
    "Over-reliance on reactive, external investigations (like the one in the example) rather than proactive, internal prevention and support systems.",
    "Lack of visible, tangible action from leadership to address the root causes, leading to erosion of trust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement and continuously review robust, transparent reporting and accountability systems for harassment and discrimination. Ensure there are multiple, safe channels for reporting.",
    "Integrate 'Fairness & Anti-Drimination' as a core, measured value in performance reviews and leadership competencies. Move from reactive to proactive.",
    "Leadership must communicate and act on these issues with visible urgency and consistency, not just when forced by external pressure."
