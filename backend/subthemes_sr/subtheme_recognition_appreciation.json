  "subtheme": "Recognition & Appreciation",

    "Respect",
    "Customer Orientation",
    "Ethical Responsibility"
  ],
  "overview": "This subtheme captures how employees perceive and discuss the company's efforts to acknowledge and reward their contributions. It matters because inadequate recognition is a significant driver of negative sentiment, indicating a potential failure to make employees feel valued.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Employees frequently inquire about compensation and benefits (e.g., salary bands, superannuation) in the absence of clear, direct recognition.",
    "Criticism focuses on the reduction or inadequacy of tangible benefits (e.g., sick leave, bonuses) as a primary indicator of being undervalued.",
    "Positive mentions are rare and often tied to specific, niche benefits (e.g., Qantas points) rather than core recognition.",
    "The discourse is heavily dominated by concerns about compensation and benefits, overshadowing other forms of recognition."

  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments emerge in online forums where employees feel safe to voice concerns about compensation and benefits, often in response to specific company announcements (e.g., benefit cuts).",
    "The subtheme is triggered by company announcements about compensation changes, or during periods when employees are comparing job offers and benefits.",
    "It interacts strongly with the broader 'Respect' dimension, as lack of recognition is interpreted as a sign of disrespect, but is also linked to 'Ethical Responsibility' when cuts are seen as breaking promises."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "A significant blind spot in measuring culture: Relying on compensation and benefits as the primary, or only, form of recognition. This leads to a transactional relationship and high negativity.",
    "Failure to recognise and promote non-monetary forms of appreciation (e.g., public praise, development opportunities) which could mitigate negativity.",
    "Ignoring the 'why': Employees are not just complaining about pay; they are highlighting a deeper issue of not feeling valued. The focus on pay is a symptom, not the root cause."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Conduct a transparent review of the total rewards package (pay, benefits, perks) against industry benchmarks, and communicate this clearly to employees.",
    "Develop and promote a formal, visible recognition program that celebrates achievements beyond sales targets, including safety, innovation, and collaboration.",
    "Train managers on the importance of non-monetary recognition and empower them to use it frequently and authentically."
