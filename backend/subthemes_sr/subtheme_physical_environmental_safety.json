    "Well-being"
  ],
  "overview": "This subtheme relates to employees' and stakeholders' sense of physical security and safety within the company's physical spaces. It matters because it is a foundational element of employee well-being; a failure to provide a safe environment can severely damage trust and psychological safety within the organization.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Security personnel overstepping authority",
    "Escalation to external authorities (e.g., police) without proper cause",
    "Involvement of non-employees (e.g., family members) in safety incidents",
    "Perception of threat where none exists"
  ],
  "sentiment_snapshot": {
    "positive": 0,

  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "This theme surfaces in narratives where company security or facilities personnel interact with employees' or visitors' families in a perceived aggressive or inappropriate manner.",
    "It is often triggered in situations where formal security protocols clash with informal, personal needs (e.g., a parent wanting to greet their child after an event).",
    "It interacts with trust in the organization and perceptions of bureaucratic inflexibility, where human elements are overridden by rigid procedures."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Blind spot: Assuming all security or environmental interactions are purely procedural and not emotional. The data shows a negative emotional reaction to an event that security likely perceived as 'by the book'.",
    "Risk: Erosion of trust in the organization's non-human elements (e.g., security, facilities) and by extension, the organization's duty of care.",
    "Risk: Escalation to external authorities (e.g., police) for non-criminal matters, damaging the organization's reputation externally."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Review and retrain security and facilities teams on de-escalation techniques and 'servant leadership' principles, emphasizing that their role is to enable safety, not to enforce exclusion.",
    "Establish a clear, transparent appeals or review process for individuals who feel they have been unjustly treated by on-site security or environmental policies.",
    "Leadership to publicly champion and reward 'humane' interactions from security and facilities teams, not just efficiency or cost-saving."
