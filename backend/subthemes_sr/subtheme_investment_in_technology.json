  "typical_contexts": [
    "This subtheme appears in the context of major strategic announcements and public communications, often from leadership or official press releases.",

  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Potential for 'tech-washing': Using high-visibility tech investments to signal innovation, while potentially under-investing in less visible cultural or social initiatives.",
    "Over-indexing on efficiency: Heavy focus on automation and digital transformation could overshadow investments in human capital, employee development, or broader social responsibility, if not balanced appropriately.",
    "Lack of holistic integration: Announcing a large tech investment might not always translate to a well-integrated, company-wide digital culture, potentially leading to pockets of resistance or inefficient implementation."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Ensure that investments in technology are part of a holistic strategy that includes employee upskilling and change management, not just capital expenditure.",
    "Maintain transparent communication about how technology investments align with the company's long-term vision and values, not just short-term financial performance.",
    "Regularly assess and report on the broader impacts of technology investments, including on company culture, employee engagement, and ethical considerations, to ensure they are achieving intended outcomes."
