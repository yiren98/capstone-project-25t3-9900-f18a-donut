    "Ethical Responsibility",

  ],
  "overview": "This subtheme captures instances where corporate activities negatively impact cultural heritage and indigenous rights, often through destruction or disrespect of culturally significant sites. It matters because it represents a severe ethical and reputational risk, reflecting a failure in due diligence and stakeholder engagement.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Destruction of culturally significant sites (e.g., Juukan Gorge) due to corporate operations",
    "Lack of proper consultation with Indigenous communities before taking action",
    "Inadequate due diligence in identifying and protecting cultural heritage",
    "Attempts to remediate or rebuild after the fact, seen as insufficient"

  "sentiment_snapshot": {
    "positive": 4,
    "negative": 30,
    "average_confidence": 0.876
  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Incidents emerge after the fact through investigative journalism or activist reports, rather than being disclosed proactively by the company",
    "Public outcry focuses on the irreversible loss of cultural heritage and the power imbalance between corporations and Indigenous communities",
    "Discussions often tie these events to broader criticisms of corporate ethics, colonialism, and the prioritization of profit over people"
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Severe and lasting reputational damage, with loss of trust from multiple stakeholder groups",
    "Legal and financial repercussions from litigation and reparations, especially as Indigenous rights gain stronger legal backing globally",
    "Inability to recover or replace cultural heritage, making the damage permanent and the apology hollow"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish and enforce a strict 'no-go' policy for operations impacting Indigenous cultural heritage, with full Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) as a minimum standard",
    "Invest in pre-operational cultural heritage assessments by independent experts, and integrate these findings meaningfully into project planning",
    "Shift from reactive PR management to proactive, transparent partnership with Indigenous communities, including shared decision-making and benefit-sharing agreements"
