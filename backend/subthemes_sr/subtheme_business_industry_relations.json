  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments often appear in news articles or online discussions where the company's partnerships or industry memberships are being discussed, especially in relation to environmental or governance issues.",

    "This subtheme interacts closely with corporate governance and external communication strategies, as stakeholders assess whether the company's actions match its public commitments."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Risk of being perceived as hypocritical or insincere if the company engages in partnerships or memberships that conflict with its stated values, like environmental commitments.",
    "Potential for reputational damage when external scrutiny (e.g., from NGOs or media) highlights gaps between stated commitments and actual industry association activities.",
    "Over-reliance on industry-standard practices without sufficient independent scrutiny, leading to assumptions that industry norms are acceptable even when they conflict with company values."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish and transparently communicate clear, public policies on industry association memberships and partnerships, including criteria for engagement and regular review processes.",
    "Implement robust due diligence processes for new partnerships and memberships, assessing alignment with core values across environmental, social, and governance dimensions.",
    "Strengthen external reporting and disclosure on industry engagement, including how memberships and partnerships are managed to uphold company values and avoid conflicts."
