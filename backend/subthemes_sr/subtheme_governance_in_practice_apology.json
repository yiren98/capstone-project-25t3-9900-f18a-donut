  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "The company risks significant reputational damage when its responses to issues are perceived as insincere, defensive, or insufficient. This can deepen stakeholder distrust and lead to prolonged public criticism.",
    "There is a blind spot in ensuring that governance and apology mechanisms are consistently applied across all operations, not just in high-profile cases. This inconsistency can undermine the credibility of the entire governance framework.",
    "The company may overlook the importance of proactive, transparent communication about its governance and mistakes, leading to a reactive pattern that fails to prevent issues or build trust preemptively."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Establish a transparent and proactive communication strategy for governance issues, ensuring that explanations and apologies are timely, sincere, and backed by concrete actions. This includes clear timelines for addressing issues and regular updates to stakeholders.",
    "Integrate governance and accountability mechanisms into core business processes, not just as a response tool. This includes regular ethical audits, stakeholder feedback loops, and training programs that emphasize ethical decision-making at all levels.",
    "Strengthen the link between governance actions and corporate values by ensuring that leadership communications and public statements are consistently aligned with actual practices. This includes public reporting on progress made after incidents and measuring the impact of apology or corrective actions."
