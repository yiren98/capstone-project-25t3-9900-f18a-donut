  "overview": "This subtheme focuses on how companies establish, maintain, and repair trust with stakeholders, including communities, partners, and the public. It is critical because trust is a foundational element of long-term success and social license to operate.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Direct statements about the quality of a relationship (e.g., 'fractured relationship')",
    "Mentions of specific actions taken to build or repair trust (e.g., apologies, compensation, consultations)",
    "References to external validation or criticism of the relationship (e.g., 'backing of political leaders')",
    "Discussions on the outcomes of trust-building or lack thereof (e.g., 'quietly engaged with stakeholders')"
  ],
  "sentiment_snapshot": {
    "positive": 1,
    "negative": 1,
    "average_confidence": 0.85
  },
  "typical_contexts": [
    "Comments often arise in the context of a crisis, scandal, or public controversy where the company's actions are under scrutiny.",
    "Discussions frequently occur in public forums, news media, and investor communications where stakeholders are evaluating corporate responsibility.",
    "It often interacts with dimensions like Corporate Responsibility and Communication & Transparency, as stakeholders judge the company's integrity and response."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Inconsistent or insincere relationship management (e.g., apologizing without changing behavior) can severely damage trust and reputation, making recovery harder.",
    "Over-reliance on a few key individuals or external validators (e.g., political leaders) for relationship management, rather than building broad, organic trust.",
    "Failing to proactively build trust before a crisis occurs, leaving the company always reacting and defending rather than leading with integrity."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute formal and transparent stakeholder engagement frameworks, especially for communities and groups most affected by operations, to build trust proactively.",
    "Develop and publicly communicate clear policies on relationship management, including conflict resolution and remediation, to ensure consistency and accountability.",
    "Leadership must model and champion trust-building behaviors, emphasizing long-term relationships over short-term gains, and ensure communication is honest and consistent."
