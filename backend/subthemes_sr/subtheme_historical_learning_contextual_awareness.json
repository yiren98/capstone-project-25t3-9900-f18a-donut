    "Learning"
  ],
  "overview": "This subtheme focuses on how companies engage with and learn from their own past actions, particularly past failures or controversies. It examines the ability to contextualize current actions within a longer historical narrative. This is important as it demonstrates accountability, transparency, and a commitment to not repeating past mistakes, which are key components of a mature and ethical corporate culture.",
  "key_patterns": [
    "Reference to specific past events (e.g., 'Rio Tinto blast', 'Juukan Gorge') as anchor points for current discussion",
    "Focus on the timing and anniversary of past events ('five years after')",
    "Comparison between past promises or contexts and current actions ('replica of destroyed... being built')",
    "Contrast between historical context and present-day implications (e.g., historical smelter info vs. modern closure)"

  "typical_contexts": [
    "Discourse arises when a company's current action is directly linked to a past failure or controversial event, prompting stakeholders to question if lessons were learned.",
    "Often appears in discussions around corporate anniversaries, project inaugurations, or public disclosures of new plans that echo old ones.",
    "Interacts heavily with dimensions of Transparency and Accountability, as stakeholders scrutinize whether the company is merely performing historical awareness or genuinely integrating those lessons."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "Superficial engagement with history: Performing 'lessons learned' without substantive change in practices, leading to repeated errors.",
    "Historical myopia: Failing to connect past actions to present-day decisions, especially in long-cycle industries like mining, leading to repeated reputational damage.",
    "External perception of insincerity: When historical references are made by the company (e.g., in press releases), but are not backed by current action, it is perceived as cynical and worsens trust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Institute formal 'Historical Context Reviews' for all major projects, ensuring past failures are actively integrated into planning and risk assessment.",
    "Develop a transparent, public-facing 'Learning from the Past' framework that documents key past events and the concrete changes made as a result, to demonstrate learning is real.",
    "Leadership communication must explicitly connect past lessons to present decisions, especially in public statements, to counter perceptions of empty rhetoric."
