  "typical_contexts": [
    "It appears most often in the context of negative news events or controversies that attract public scrutiny, such as the destruction of a culturally significant site.",
    "It also appears when community members are directly engaging with the company for support, information, or employment opportunities, showing a more positive, day-to-day interaction.",
    "The discourse is often polarized, with strong negative sentiment linked to corporate actions, while positive sentiment is linked to local, individual-level interactions."
  ],
  "risks_and_blindspots": [
    "The company is perceived as acting unethically or irresponsibly in the community, leading to significant reputational damage.",
    "A disconnect exists between the company's internal priorities and the expectations of the local community, leading to misunderstandings and conflict.",
    "Positive community engagement is not effectively communicated or is overshadowed by negative events, missing an opportunity to build trust."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Proactively engage in transparent communication about community projects and environmental stewardship to rebuild trust.",
    "Establish and publicize clear corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that are visible and beneficial to the local community.",
    "Create formal channels for community feedback and dialogue to address concerns before they escalate into public scandals."
